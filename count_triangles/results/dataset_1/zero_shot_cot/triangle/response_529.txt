Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:
Total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula: 
\[ \text{Total triangles} = \frac{1}{3} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \text{deg}(v_i)^2 - \text{number of triangles with a common edge} \]
Where:
- \(n\) is the total number of vertices (nodes).
- \(\text{deg}(v_i)\) is the degree of vertex \(v_i\).
- The division by 3 is done because each triangle is counted 3 times, once for each vertex.
- We need to subtract the number of triangles with a common edge to avoid counting the same triangle multiple times.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, we can calculate the total number of triangles following the formula above.

Number of triangles with a common edge can be calculated by counting triangles in the form of (i, j), (i, k), (j, k) where (i, j), (j, k), (k, i) are edges in the graph.

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles and list those triangles.

\[ \text{Total triangles} = \frac{1}{3} \left( \sum\limits_{i=0}^{9} \text{deg}(v_i)^2 \right) - \text{number of triangles with a common edge} \]

Calculating the degree of each vertex:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Node} & \text{Degree} \\
\hline
0 & 6 \\
1 & 4 \\
2 & 3 \\
3 & 5 \\
4 & 4 \\
5 & 1 \\
6 & 1 \\
7 & 4 \\
8 & 2 \\
9 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Calculating:

\[
\text{Total triangles} = \frac{1}{3} \left( 6^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 4^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 + 6^2 \right) - \text{number of triangles with a common edge}
\]

\[ = \frac{1}{3} \left( 36 + 16 + 9 + 25 + 16 + 1 + 1 + 16 + 4 + 36 \right) - \text{number of triangles with a common edge} \]

\[ = \frac{1}{3} \times 144 - \text{number of triangles with a common edge} \]

\[ = 48 - \text{number of triangles with a common edge} \]

Now, we need to count the number of triangles with a common edge in the graph:
These are the triangles with common edges: (0,1,3), (0,2,9), (0,3,9), and (1,3,9).

\[ \text{Total triangles} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Therefore, there are 44 triangles in total in the given graph.
