Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the triangles in this graph:
1. Look for nodes that have an edge connecting each other, forming a triangle with three edges.
2. Count the number of unique triangles.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 8>

Thus, there are a total of [5] triangles in this graph.
