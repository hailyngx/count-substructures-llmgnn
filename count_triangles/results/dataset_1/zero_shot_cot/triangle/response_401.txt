Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 1: degree = 1
- Node 2: degree = 1
- Node 3: degree = 1
- Node 4: degree = 2
- Node 7: degree = 2
- Node 8: degree = 2
- Node 9: degree = 2

Step 2: Check for triangles.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
  Therefore, a triangle is formed: <0, 3, 8>.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7. Node 1 is not connected to node 7.
  Therefore, no triangles are formed with node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 9. Node 4 is also connected to node 9.
  Therefore, a triangle is formed: <4, 7, 9>.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 2. Node 0 is also connected to node 2.
  Therefore, a triangle is formed: <0, 8, 2>.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 7. Node 0 is also connected to node 7.
  Therefore, a triangle is formed: <0, 9, 7>.

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles.
- Total number of triangles = 4
