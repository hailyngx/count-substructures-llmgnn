Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the connected nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other following the edges of the graph.

Let's list out the triangles identified step by step:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with node 0 as it has connections only with node 6.

2. Triangles involving node 1:
    - Triangle <1, 4, 8>

3. Triangles involving node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with node 2 as it shares edges with nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9, but no set of three nodes forms a triangle.

4. Triangles involving node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with node 3 as it shares edges with nodes 4, 6, and 8, but no set of three nodes forms a triangle.

5. Triangles involving node 4:
    - No additional triangles can be formed with node 4 as the triangle <1, 4, 8> was already identified when considering node 1.

6. Triangles involving node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with node 5 as it has connections only with node 1.

7. Triangles involving node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with node 6 as it has connections only with nodes 0 and 1.

8. Triangles involving node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with node 7 as it has connections only with node 2.

9. Triangles involving node 8:
    - No additional triangles can be formed with node 8 as the triangle <1, 4, 8> was already identified when considering node 1.

10. Triangles involving node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with node 9 as it has connections only with node 1.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <1, 4, 8>.
