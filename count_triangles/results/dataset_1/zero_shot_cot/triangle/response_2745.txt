Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 1: degree = 2
- Node 2: degree = 4
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 2
- Node 5: degree = 1
- Node 6: degree = 1
- Node 7: degree = 5
- Node 8: degree = 3
- Node 9: degree = 3

Step 2: Count the number of triangles using the formula:
Number of triangles = 1/6 * Σ(degree of node i) * (Σ(degree of node i)^2 - Σ(degree of adjacent nodes)^2)

Let's calculate it:
- Node 0: 1/6 * 3 * (3^2 - (4 + 3)^2) = 1/6 * 3 * (9 - 49) = 1/6 * 3 * (-40) = -20
- Node 1: 1/6 * 2 * (2^2 - (2 + 2)^2) = 1/6 * 2 * (4 - 16) = 1/6 * 2 * (-12) = -4
- Node 2: 1/6 * 4 * (4^2 - (3 + 4 + 4)^2) = 1/6 * 4 * (16 - 121) = 1/6 * 4 * (-105) = -70
- Node 3: 1/6 * 4 * (4^2 - (3 + 4 + 4)^2) = 1/6 * 4 * (16 - 121) = 1/6 * 4 * (-105) = -70
- Node 4: 1/6 * 2 * (2^2 - (2 + 4)^2) = 1/6 * 2 * (4 - 36) = 1/6 * 2 * (-32) = -10
- Node 5: 0 triangles since degree = 1
- Node 6: 0 triangles since degree = 1
- Node 7: 1/6 * 5 * (5^2 - (4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 2)^2) = 1/6 * 5 * (25 - 324) = 1/6 * 5 * (-299) = -249
- Node 8: 1/6 * 3 * (3^2 - (4 + 3 + 3)^2) = 1/6 * 3 * (9 - 100) = 1/6 * 3 * (-91) = -46
- Node 9: 1/6 * 3 * (3^2 - (2 + 5 + 3)^2) = 1/6 * 3 * (9 - 100) = 1/6 * 3 * (-91) = -46

Summing up the triangles from each node:
- Total triangles = (-20) + (-4) + (-70) + (-70) + (-10) + (-249) + (-46) + (-46) = -515

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [-515].
