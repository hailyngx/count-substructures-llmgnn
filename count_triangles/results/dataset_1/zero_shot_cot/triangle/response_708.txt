Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) 

Response:
In order to find the total number of triangles in the graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
