Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles and then count the total number:

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <1, 4, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]
