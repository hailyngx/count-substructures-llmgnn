Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

1. From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
    - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 9>
    - Triangle 2: <1, 3, 4>
    - Triangle 3: <3, 5, 7>
    - Triangle 4: <3, 6, 9>
    - Triangle 5: <4, 5, 9>
    - Triangle 6: <6, 7, 9>

2. Count the total number of triangles: [6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 6.
