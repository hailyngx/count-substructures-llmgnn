Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify each unique set of three nodes that form a triangle. Let's list the triangles first:

1. <1, 2, 3>
2. <1, 4, 7>
3. <1, 8, 9>
4. <2, 3, 6>
5. <5, 6, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
