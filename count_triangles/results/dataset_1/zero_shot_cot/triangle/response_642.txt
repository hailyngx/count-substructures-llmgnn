Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Considering the given graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's find the total number of triangles in the graph.

To do this, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. These form triangles in the graph.

Let's denote the nodes as:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's identify the triangles present:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 4, 8>
3. <2, 4, 6>
4. <3, 7, 8>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
