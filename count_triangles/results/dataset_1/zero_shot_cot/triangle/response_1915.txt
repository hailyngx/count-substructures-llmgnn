Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 2.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.

Let's now count the triangles:

1. <1, 4, 2>
2. <3, 7, 9>
3. <2, 5, 6>
4. <2, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
