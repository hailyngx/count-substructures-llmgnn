Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 2.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.

Now, let's find the triangles:

- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle 2: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 3: <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
