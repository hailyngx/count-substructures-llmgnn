Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Here are the steps to determine this:

1. Identify all triangles formed by the connected nodes:
   - Triangle 1: Nodes (2, 4, 3)
   - Triangle 2: Nodes (2, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 3: Nodes (2, 3, 5)
   - Triangle 4: Nodes (4, 3, 5)
   
2. Calculate total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 4
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles are <2, 4, 3>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, and <4, 3, 5>.
