Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique triangles in this graph. The triangles are as follows:
<2, 1, 5>
<7, 1, 5>
<7, 3, 5>
<8, 2, 5>

So, the total number of triangles is [4].
