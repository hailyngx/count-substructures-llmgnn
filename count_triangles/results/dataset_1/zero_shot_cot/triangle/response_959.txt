Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Let's identify all possible triangles by looking at each node pair and checking for a third node that connects to both.
2. We will list the unique triangles found.

Starting with the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:

<0, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
