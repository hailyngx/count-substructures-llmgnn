Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 6, 8, 9.
2. Node 1 does not form any triangles.
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 9.
4. Node 3 does not form any triangles.
5. Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 1, 6, 7.
6. Node 5 does not form any triangles.
7. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 9.
8. Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 5.
9. Node 8 does not form any triangles.
10. Node 9 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 2.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 5, and the unique triangles are:
<0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 7>.

So, the answer is: [5].
