Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for each unique set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's break it down step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9. None of these nodes are connected to each other, so no triangle can be formed with node 0.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 8. No triangle can be formed with node 1.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 5, forming a triangle <0, 4, 5>.
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 8. No triangle can be formed with node 5.
5. Node 6 is connected to node 0. No triangle can be formed with node 6.
6. Node 7 is connected to node 9. No triangle can be formed with node 7.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9. This forms two triangles: <1, 8, 9> and <5, 8, 9>.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8. These connections form one triangle: <0, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles are <0, 4, 5>, <1, 8, 9>, and <5, 8, 9>.
