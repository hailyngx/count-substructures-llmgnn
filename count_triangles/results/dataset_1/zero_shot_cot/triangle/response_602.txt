Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. We need to identify all the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's list each triangle:

- <0, 3, 2>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <6, 8, 9>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles found: [4]
