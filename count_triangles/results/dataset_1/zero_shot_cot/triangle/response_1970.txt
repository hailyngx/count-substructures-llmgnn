Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Let's list all triangles in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 2, 9>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 4, 3>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 5: <1, 2, 3>
   - Triangle 6: <2, 4, 9>
   - Triangle 7: <2, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 8: <3, 4, 9>
   - Triangle 9: <4, 8, 5>
   - Triangle 10: <7, 8, 9>

2. Count the total number of triangles found: [10]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
