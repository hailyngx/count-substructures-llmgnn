Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 4.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 4.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4.

Now, let's identify the triangles (sets of three mutually connected nodes):
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle 3: <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle 4: <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle 5: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 6: <3, 4, 7>
- Triangle 7: <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle 8: <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
