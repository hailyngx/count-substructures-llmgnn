Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles present in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle 2: <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle 3: <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle 4: <3, 4, 6>
- Triangle 5: <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
