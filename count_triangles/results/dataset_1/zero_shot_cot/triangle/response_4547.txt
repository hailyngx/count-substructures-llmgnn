Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's start by identifying the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
5. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
