Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Analyzing the edge connections, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <1, 5, 8>
5. <1, 4, 5>
6. <3, 0, 6>
7. <4, 1, 5>
8. <5, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [8]
