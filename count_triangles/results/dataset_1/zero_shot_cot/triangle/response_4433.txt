Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node in the graph:
- Node 0: degree = 2
- Node 1: degree = 4
- Node 2: degree = 1
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 1
- Node 5: degree = 3
- Node 6: degree = 4
- Node 7: degree = 1
- Node 8: degree = 4
- Node 9: degree = 4

Step 2: Identify triangles in the graph:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <6, 8, 9>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [6]
