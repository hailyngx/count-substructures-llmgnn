Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list down the triangles step by step:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - <0, 1, 6>
   - <0, 2, 6>
   - <0, 5, 6>
   
2. Triangles involving node 1:
   - <1, 4, 6>
   - <1, 5, 6>
   - <1, 6, 8>
   
3. Triangles involving node 2:
   - No triangle involving node 2.
   
4. Triangles involving node 3:
   - No triangle involving node 3.
   
5. Triangles involving node 4:
   - No triangle involving node 4.
   
6. Triangles involving node 5:
   - <5, 6, 8>
   
7. Triangles involving node 6:
   - No new triangles involving node 6.
   
8. Triangles involving node 7:
   - No triangle involving node 7.
   
9. Triangles involving node 8:
   - No new triangles involving node 8.
   
10. Triangles involving node 9:
   - No triangle involving node 9.
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
