Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

By examining the given edges, we can find the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 4, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
