Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
By observing the given graph, we can list down the triangles present:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle 2: <1, 4, 2>
- Triangle 3: <1, 8, 9>
- Triangle 4: <1, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
