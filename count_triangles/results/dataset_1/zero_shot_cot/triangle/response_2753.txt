Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
2. Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 2, 9}
3. Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5}
4. Node 3: Neighbors = {0}
5. Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 8}
6. Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 9}
7. Node 6: Neighbors = {5}
8. Node 8: Neighbors = {4}
9. Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5}

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
