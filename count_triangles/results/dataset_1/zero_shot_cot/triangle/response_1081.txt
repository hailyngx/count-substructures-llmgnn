Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes.

Let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <0, 9, 7>
5. <0, 9, 3>
6. <1, 8, 2>
7. <2, 3, 9>
8. <6, 8, 4>
9. <6, 8, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
