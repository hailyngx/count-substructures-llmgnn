Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting how many sets of three nodes are connected to each other. Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in this graph.
