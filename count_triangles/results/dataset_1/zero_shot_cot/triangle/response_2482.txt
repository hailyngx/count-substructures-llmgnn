Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 8>

Total number of triangles: [5]
