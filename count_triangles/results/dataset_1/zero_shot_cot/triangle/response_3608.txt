Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique combinations of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 1, 9>
4. <0, 4, 9>
5. <1, 4, 7>
6. <2, 4, 7>
7. <2, 6, 7>
8. <4, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
