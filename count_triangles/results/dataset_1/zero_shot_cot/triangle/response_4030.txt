Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph using the edge list provided.

Starting with each edge (u, v), we will check if there is a third node w such that there are edges from u to w, v to w, and w to u forming a triangle.

The total number of triangles can be found by summing up the number of triangles formed by each edge.

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
<0, 5, 6>
