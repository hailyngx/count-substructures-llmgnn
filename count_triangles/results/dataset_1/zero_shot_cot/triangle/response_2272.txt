Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Firstly, let's identify all the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. We need to find all such sets of three nodes.

2. Given the edges, here are the unique triangles present in the graph:
   - <0, 3, 4>
   - <0, 3, 7>
   - <0, 3, 8>
   - <0, 4, 8>
   - <1, 3, 5>
   - <1, 3, 8>
   - <1, 3, 9>
   - <1, 5, 8>
   - <1, 5, 9>
   - <1, 8, 9>
   - <2, 3, 7>
   - <2, 3, 8>
   - <2, 3, 9>
   - <2, 7, 8>
   - <2, 7, 9>
   - <2, 8, 9>
   - <3, 7, 8>
   - <3, 8, 9>
   - <5, 8, 9>

3. There are 19 unique triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
