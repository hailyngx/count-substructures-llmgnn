Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's examine each node and its neighbors to check for triangles.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <1, 7, 8>
3. <3, 4, 6>
4. <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
