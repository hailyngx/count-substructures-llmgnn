Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <3, 6, 9>
6. Triangle <4, 5, 8>
7. Triangle <5, 8, 9>
8. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
