Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph using the edge list provided.

1. <0, 5, 3>
2. <0, 5, 1>
3. <0, 2, 6>
4. <0, 2, 5>
5. <5, 1, 8>
6. <5, 3, 9>
7. <5, 3, 6>
8. <5, 3, 0>
9. <5, 2, 6>
10. <3, 9, 1>
11. <3, 9, 6>
12. <3, 9, 7>
13. <3, 8, 1>
14. <2, 6, 0>
15. <9, 6, 7>
16. <1, 9, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [16] triangles in the given graph.
