Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 4 and node 8: <0, 4, 8>
2. Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9) -> Forms a triangle with node 6, 8, and 9: <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 8, 9>
3. Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 4, 7, and 8: <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 8>
4. Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with node 5, 8, and 9: <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 8, 9>
5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 7) -> Already counted in step 2 and 3
6. Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with node 3 and 6: <3, 5, 6>
7. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9) -> Already counted in steps 2 and 5
8. Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9) -> Already counted in steps 3 and 6
9. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 6) -> Forms a triangle with node 0, 2, and 3: <0, 2, 3>
10. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7) -> Already counted in steps 2 and 5

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
