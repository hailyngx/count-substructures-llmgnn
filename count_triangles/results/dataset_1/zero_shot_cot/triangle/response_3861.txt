Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes that are mutually connected to each other.

Upon analyzing the given graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, the triangles that can be found are as follows:

1. <1, 3, 4>
2. <1, 3, 8>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <1, 4, 9>
5. <3, 4, 8>
6. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
