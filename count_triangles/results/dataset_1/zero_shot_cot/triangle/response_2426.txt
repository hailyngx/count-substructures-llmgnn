Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 1 and 3.
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 0 and 9.
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 5 and 9.
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 0 and 8.
5. Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
6. Node 8: Connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
7. Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle 2: <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle 3: <3, 5, 8>
- Triangle 4: <5, 8, 9>

Count of triangles = 4

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
