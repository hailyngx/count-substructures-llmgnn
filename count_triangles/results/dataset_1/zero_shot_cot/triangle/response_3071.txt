Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles that can be formed in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
   - Triangle: <0, 4, 6>  
   
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
   - Triangle: <0, 4, 7>  
   
3. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
   - Triangle: <0, 4, 7>  

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
