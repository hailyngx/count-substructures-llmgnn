Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. For each node, determine its neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2 and 4
- Node 1: Neighbors are 5, 6, and 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0 and 4
- Node 3: Neighbors are 4, 6, and 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 2, 3, and 5
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1 and 4
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1 and 3
- Node 8: Neighbor is 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 3, and 8

2. Identify the triangles formed by nodes:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
- Triangle 2: (1, 5, 4)
- Triangle 3: (1, 9, 3)
- Triangle 4: (3, 9, 8)

Since these triangles are unique, we count each one only once.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 9, 3>, and <3, 9, 8>.
