Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (5, 2) (6, 2) (8, 2) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
4. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
6. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
7. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
8. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
9. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
10. Triangle <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are **10 triangles** in total in the given graph.
