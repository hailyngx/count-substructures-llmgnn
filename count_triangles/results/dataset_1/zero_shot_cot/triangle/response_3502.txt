Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 9>.
