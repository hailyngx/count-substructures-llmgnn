Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: First, let's identify the possible triangles in the graph based on the given edges.

Possible triangles:
- (0, 7, 1)
- (1, 3, 4)
- (1, 7, 6)
- (1, 9, 2)
- (2, 4, 3)
- (2, 6, 7)
- (2, 7, 1)
- (2, 9, 6)
- (3, 4, 2)
- (5, 6, 7)
- (5, 6, 9)

Step 2: Count the unique triangles.

Unique triangles:
1. <0, 7, 1>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 7, 6>
4. <1, 9, 2>
5. <2, 4, 3>
6. <2, 6, 7>
7. <2, 9, 6>
8. <5, 6, 7>
9. <5, 6, 9>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [9]
