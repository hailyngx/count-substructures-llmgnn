Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's list all the triangles below:

1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <8, 0, 9>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
