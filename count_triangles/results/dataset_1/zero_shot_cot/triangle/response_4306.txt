Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 7, 9>.
