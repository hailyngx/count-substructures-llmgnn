Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are pairwise connected. 

By inspecting the edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 4>

So, there are [4] triangles in the graph.
