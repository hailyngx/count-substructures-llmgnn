Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the triangles present in the graph by examining each set of three interconnected nodes.
2. Check if each triangle is unique to avoid double-counting.
3. List the unique triangles found inside <> each only once.

Let's start by listing the unique triangles present in the graph:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 7>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles by counting the unique triangles we found above:

Total number of triangles: [8]
