Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph, which are formed by 3 nodes connected to each other. 
To calculate the total number of triangles, we can use the relationship that a triangle is formed when there is a common neighbor to two nodes.

Let's list the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 8, 9>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <1, 4, 6>
6. <2, 6, 9>
7. <2, 7, 9>
8. <6, 7, 8>
9. <7, 8, 9>

There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is: [9].
