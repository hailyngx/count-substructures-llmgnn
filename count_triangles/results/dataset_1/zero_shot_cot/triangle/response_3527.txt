Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, the total number of triangles can be calculated by examining each set of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the triangles step by step:

1. Based on the edges given, the triangles present in the graph are:
   <0, 2, 5>
   <0, 3, 8>
   <0, 5, 9>
   <2, 5, 8>
   <8, 9, 5>

2. Counting the total number of unique triangles found above, the answer is the number of triangles in brackets []:
