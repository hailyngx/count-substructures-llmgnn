Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can observe that a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's analyze each node with its adjacent nodes to identify triangles.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <3, 5, 7>
6. <3, 5, 9>
7. <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
