Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 6>, <1, 8, 9>, <6, 3, 9>.
