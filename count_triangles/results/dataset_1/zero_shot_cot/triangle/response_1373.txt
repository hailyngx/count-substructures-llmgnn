Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list out the triangles in the given graph based on the provided edges:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
5. Triangle <2, 0, 5>
6. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
7. Triangle <4, 0, 6>
8. Triangle <4, 8, 1>
9. Triangle <5, 0, 1>
10. Triangle <5, 2, 7>
11. Triangle <6, 0, 1>
12. Triangle <6, 3, 1>
13. Triangle <6, 4, 0>
14. Triangle <7, 2, 5>
15. Triangle <8, 1, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of 15 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the output is [15].
