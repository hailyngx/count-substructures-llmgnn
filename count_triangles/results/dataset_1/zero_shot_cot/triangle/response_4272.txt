Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's count the number of triangles:

- Triangle 1: (1, 5, 8)
- Triangle 2: (4, 8, 9)
- Triangle 3: (7, 8, 9)

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
