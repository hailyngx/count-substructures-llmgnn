Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will examine all possible combinations of three nodes (triangles) and check if there are edges connecting each pair of the three nodes.

Let's find the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to each other:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 7
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 8

2. Checking for triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <5, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles in the given graph: [7]
