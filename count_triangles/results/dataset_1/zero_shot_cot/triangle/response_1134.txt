Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by finding all the cycles of length 3. We will then count the total number of triangles.

The triangles found in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 2, 5>
4. <0, 5, 6>
5. <1, 2, 8>
6. <2, 3, 7>
7. <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
