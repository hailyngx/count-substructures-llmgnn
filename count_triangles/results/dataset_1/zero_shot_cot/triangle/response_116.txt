Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all the triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other forming a closed loop.

Given the graph, we can list out the unique triangles:

1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <0, 5, 4>
4. <2, 5, 4>
5. <5, 4, 3>
6. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
