Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step by step.

Triangles in the given graph:
1. <1, 3, 8>
2. <2, 3, 5>
3. <3, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
