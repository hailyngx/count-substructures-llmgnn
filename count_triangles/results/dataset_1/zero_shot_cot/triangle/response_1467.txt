Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 1>.
