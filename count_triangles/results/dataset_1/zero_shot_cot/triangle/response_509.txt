Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify the triangles one by one. Let's go step-by-step:

Triangle 1: (0, 1, 2)
Triangle 2: (0, 1, 7)
Triangle 3: (0, 1, 8)
Triangle 4: (0, 2, 7)
Triangle 5: (1, 2, 9)
Triangle 6: (1, 3, 7)
Triangle 7: (1, 4, 6)
Triangle 8: (2, 6, 7)
Triangle 9: (5, 8, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, and <5, 8, 9>.
