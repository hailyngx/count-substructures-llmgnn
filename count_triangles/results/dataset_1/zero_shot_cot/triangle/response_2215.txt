Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles by examining each triplet of nodes and checking if they form a triangle by having edges connecting all three nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes that form triangles:
- <0,1,9>
- <2,4,6>
- <3,4,7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
