Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's check for the triangles:
1. Triangle with nodes 1, 5, and 7. (1, 5), (5, 1), (1, 7), and (7, 1) edges exist.
2. Triangle with nodes 1, 7, and 3. (1, 7), (7, 1), (7, 3), and (3, 7) edges exist.
3. Triangle with nodes 1, 7, and 5. (1, 7), (7, 1), (5, 1), and (1, 5) edges exist.
4. Triangle with nodes 2, 4, and 8. (2, 8), (8, 2), (8, 4), and (4, 8) edges exist.
5. Triangle with nodes 8, 9, and 6. (8, 9), (9, 8), (9, 6), and (6, 9) edges exist.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph, which are:
<1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 7, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <8, 9, 6>.

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
