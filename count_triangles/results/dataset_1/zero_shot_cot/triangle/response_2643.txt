Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's go step-by-step to find the number of triangles in the given graph.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 3.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
