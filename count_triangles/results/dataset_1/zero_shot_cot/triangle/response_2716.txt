Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Considering the given edges, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <1, 2, 7>
4. <3, 6, 7>
5. <4, 6, 7>
6. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
