Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can determine the number of triangles by examining each possible triangle formed by the edges. 

Here are the triangles we can find in this graph:
1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <0, 3, 2>
4. <0, 3, 5>
5. <1, 4, 9>
6. <2, 3, 7>
7. <2, 7, 5>
8. <4, 5, 9>
9. <4, 6, 5>
10. <7, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [10].
