Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are interconnected by edges.

Let's list all the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 2, 1>
4. <0, 5, 6>
5. <3, 8, 7>
6. <3, 8, 9>
7. <3, 7, 4>
8. <8, 9, 1>

Total number of triangles: [8]
