Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that have connections to form triangles.

For each node, we will check if there is a triangle. A triangle exists when a node is connected to two other nodes that are also connected to each other.

Here are the triangles in the graph:
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <8, 6, 4>
- <9, 1, 5>

Counting the triangles, we find that there are [6] triangles in total.
