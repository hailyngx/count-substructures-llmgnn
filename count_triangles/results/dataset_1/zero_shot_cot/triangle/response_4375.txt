Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From the given edges, we can identify the triangles formed by every three connected nodes:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 4)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 5, 2)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 6, 2)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 4, 2)
   - Triangle 5: (1, 9, 3)
   - Triangle 6: (2, 9, 3)
   - Triangle 7: (2, 5, 4)
   - Triangle 8: (2, 6, 5)

2. Counting the above unique triangles, we find that there are 8 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
