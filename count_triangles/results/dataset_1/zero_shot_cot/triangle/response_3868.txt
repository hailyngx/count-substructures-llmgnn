Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the possible triangles in the graph by looking at the edges:

1. (0, 2, 5)
2. (0, 2, 6)
3. (0, 4, 1)
4. (0, 4, 8)
5. (1, 4, 5)
6. (1, 5, 8)
7. (5, 8, 4)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
