Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every unique combination of 3 nodes that are connected with each other.

Let's list out the triangles:
1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 7, 1>
4. <0, 7, 8>
5. <0, 7, 9>
6. <0, 8, 4>
7. <0, 9, 4>
8. <1, 3, 7>
9. <1, 7, 9>
10. <3, 4, 8>
11. <3, 6, 7>
12. <4, 8, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
