Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, let's follow these steps:

1. Check each triplet of nodes and see if there are edges between all three nodes.

2. List out all the triangles we find and count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's start analyzing the graph:

1. Triangles:
   - <0, 5, 9>
   - <1, 2, 4>
   - <2, 3, 5>
   - <2, 3, 9>
   - <2, 5, 7>
   - <3, 6, 9>
   - <4, 5, 6>
   - <6, 7, 9>

There are 8 unique triangles in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
