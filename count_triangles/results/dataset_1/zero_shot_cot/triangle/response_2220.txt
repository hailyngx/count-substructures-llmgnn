Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Look for triangles by checking each possible combination of three nodes.

1. (0, 2, 3)
2. (0, 2, 4)
3. (0, 2, 6)
4. (0, 3, 4)
5. (0, 3, 6)
6. (0, 4, 6)
7. (1, 3, 4)
8. (1, 5, 8)
9. (1, 5, 9)
10. (1, 8, 9)
11. (3, 4, 6)
12. (5, 8, 9)

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles found.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12]. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, and <5, 8, 9>.
