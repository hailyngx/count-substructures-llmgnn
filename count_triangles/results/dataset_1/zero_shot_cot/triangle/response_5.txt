Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles by identifying nodes that form a triangle together.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<5, 6, 9>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
