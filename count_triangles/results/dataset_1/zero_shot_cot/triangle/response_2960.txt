Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
