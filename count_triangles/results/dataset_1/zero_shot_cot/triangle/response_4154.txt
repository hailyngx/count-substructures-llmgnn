Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find all triangles in the graph by identifying all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected to each other. We will then count the number of unique triangles.

The list of unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
