Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a triangle. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Nodes directly connected: (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 2), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 3)

2. Let's find the triangles in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: (2, 3, 5)
   - Triangle 2: (2, 3, 6)
   - Triangle 3: (2, 5, 6)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, and <2, 5, 6>.
