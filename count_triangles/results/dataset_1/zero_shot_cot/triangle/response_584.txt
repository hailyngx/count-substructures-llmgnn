Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go through this step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 3, 4, and 5: <0, 3, 4> and <0, 3, 5>.
2. Node 2 does not form any triangles.
3. Node 3 forms a triangle with node 6: <3, 0, 6>.
4. Node 4 does not form any triangles.
5. Node 5 forms a triangle with node 8: <5, 0, 8>.
6. Node 6 does not form any triangles.
7. Nodes 7 and 9 form a triangle with each other: <7, 9, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
