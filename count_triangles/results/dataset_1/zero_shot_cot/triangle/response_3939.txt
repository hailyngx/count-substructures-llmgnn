Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in this graph, we can analyze the triangles formed by each set of three connected nodes.

Let's list the unique triangles found in this graph:

<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<6, 7, 8>

Counting the unique triangles mentioned above, we get a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
