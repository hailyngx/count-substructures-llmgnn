Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle. Let's go step-by-step to identify and count the triangles:

1. **Create a Adjacency Matrix**: First, let's create an adjacency matrix based on the given edges to represent the connections between nodes. Each cell in the matrix will indicate whether there is an edge between the corresponding nodes.  

   The adjacency matrix for the given graph is as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{cccccccccc}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

2. **Identify Triangles**: Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph by checking for each possible triplet of nodes if there are connections between all three nodes.

   - Triangles: <2, 5, 4>, <2, 5, 1>

3. **Count the Triangles**: There are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
