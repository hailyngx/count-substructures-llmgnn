Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 4>, <1, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 9, 3>.
