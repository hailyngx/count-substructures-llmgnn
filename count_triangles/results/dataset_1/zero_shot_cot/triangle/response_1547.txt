Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <0, 3, 9>
5. <0, 6, 5>
6. <0, 6, 9>
7. <0, 8, 7>
8. <0, 8, 9>
9. <1, 2, 7>
10. <3, 6, 5>
11. <3, 6, 9>
12. <3, 7, 8>
13. <3, 7, 9>
14. <5, 6, 9>
15. <7, 8, 9>

Counting the unique triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
