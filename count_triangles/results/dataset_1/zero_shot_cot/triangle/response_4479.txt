Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: To find triangles, we need to look for nodes that have at least two edges connecting them. Let's identify such nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 8
- Node 1 is connected to node 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6
- Node 3 is connected to node 5
- Node 4 is connected to node 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8

Step 2: For each pair of nodes connected by an edge, we check if there is a third node that connects them to form a triangle:
- Node 0 with nodes 7 and 8 forms a triangle if node 7 is connected to node 8, which is the case here.
- Node 2 with nodes 4 and 5 forms a triangle if node 4 is connected to node 5, which is the case here.
- Node 2 with nodes 5 and 6 forms a triangle if node 5 is connected to node 6, which is the case here.
- Node 5 with nodes 8 and 9 forms a triangle if node 8 is connected to node 9, which is the case here.

Step 3: Count the number of unique triangles found:
There are [4] triangles in total.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<5, 8, 9>
