Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's identify the triangles by examining all possible connections among the nodes based on the provided edges:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
