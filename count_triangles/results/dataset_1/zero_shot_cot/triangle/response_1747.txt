Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0's neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6.
   Triangles involving node 0: <0, 1, 2>; <0, 2, 5>; <0, 1, 6>; <0, 5, 6>.
   
2. Node 1's neighbors: 0, 2, 6.
   Triangles involving node 1: <0, 1, 2>; <0, 1, 6>.

3. Node 2's neighbors: 0, 1, 4.
   Triangles involving node 2: <0, 1, 2>.

4. Node 3's neighbors: 8, 9.
   No triangles involving node 3.

5. Node 4's neighbors: 2, 5, 9.
   No triangles involving node 4.

6. Node 5's neighbors: 0, 4.
   No triangles involving node 5.

7. Node 6's neighbors: 0, 1, 9.
   No triangles involving node 6.

8. Node 7's neighbors: 8.
   No triangles involving node 7.

9. Node 8's neighbors: 3, 7.
   No triangles involving node 8.

10. Node 9's neighbors: 3, 4, 6.
    No triangles involving node 9.

Total number of triangles: [3]  
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 1, 6>.
