Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 1)
   - Forms a triangle with: none

2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 7)
   - Forms a triangle with: <0, 1, 4>

3. Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 7)
   - Forms a triangle with: none

4. Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 5)
   - Forms a triangle with: none

5. Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6)
   - Forms a triangle with: <1, 4, 7>

6. Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 7)
   - Forms a triangle with: none

7. Node 6: (6, 4)
   - Forms a triangle with: none

8. Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5)
   - Forms a triangle with: <1, 4, 7>

9. Node 8: (8, 9)
   - Forms a triangle with: none

10. Node 9: (9, 8)
   - Forms a triangle with: none

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4> and <1, 4, 7>.
