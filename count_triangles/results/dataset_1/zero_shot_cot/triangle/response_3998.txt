Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

To do this, we consider each node pair in the graph and see if there is a third node that is connected to both nodes in the pair. Let's systematically go through each node pair:

Nodes connected to node 0: 9
Nodes connected to node 1: 2, 3, 7, 8
Nodes connected to node 2: 1, 4, 6
Nodes connected to node 3: 1
Nodes connected to node 4: 2, 8
Nodes connected to node 5: 6, 8
Nodes connected to node 6: 2, 5, 9
Nodes connected to node 7: 1, 8, 9
Nodes connected to node 8: 1, 4, 5, 7
Nodes connected to node 9: 0, 6, 7

Let's count the triangles:
1. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
7. Triangle <2, 6, 5>
8. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
9. Triangle <4, 5, 8>
10. Triangle <6, 5, 8>
11. Triangle <6, 5, 9>
12. Triangle <6, 7, 9>
13. Triangle <7, 8, 1>
14. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
