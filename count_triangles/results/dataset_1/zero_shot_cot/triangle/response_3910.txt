Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Check all possible triangles involving each node:
   - Node 0: No triangles.
   - Node 1: Triangles with nodes 2, 4, and 6.
   - Node 2: Triangles with nodes 0, 1, 3, 8.
   - Node 3: Triangles with nodes 2, 4, 5, 6.
   - Node 4: Triangles with nodes 1, 3, 5.
   - Node 5: Triangles with nodes 3, 4.
   - Node 6: Triangles with nodes 1, 3, 8.
   - Node 8: Triangles with nodes 2, 6.

2. Count the number of unique triangles:

   - <1, 2, 4>
   - <2, 3, 4>
   - <1, 3, 6>
   - <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
