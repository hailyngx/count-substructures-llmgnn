Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other directly. We can go through each distinct triplet of nodes and check if they form a triangle.

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <2, 3, 4>
3. <2, 3, 5>
4. <2, 4, 5>
5. <3, 5, 6>

Counting the total number of triangles, we have a total of [5] triangles in this graph.
