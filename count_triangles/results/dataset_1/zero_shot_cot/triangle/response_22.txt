Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph.

- Triangle 1: (1, 2, 6)
- Triangle 2: (5, 6, 7)

Thus, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
