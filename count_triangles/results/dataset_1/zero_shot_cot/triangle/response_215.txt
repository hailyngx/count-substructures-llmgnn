Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list out the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <0, 6, 7>
5. <1, 3, 6>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
