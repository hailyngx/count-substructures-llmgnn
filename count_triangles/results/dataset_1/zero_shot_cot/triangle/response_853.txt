Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) 

Response:
Analyzing the given graph to find the total number of triangles:

First, let's list all the triangles that we can form based on the given edges:

1. Nodes (0, 6) are connected by an edge. For a triangle, we need one more node connected to both of these nodes. The only node that is connected to both 0 and 6 is node 5.
2. Nodes (1, 5) and (1, 7) are connected. The common node is 5.
3. Nodes (1, 7) and (1, 8) are connected. The common node is 1.
4. Nodes (2, 4) and (2, 8) are connected. The common node is 2.
5. Nodes (4, 5) and (5, 1) are connected. The common node is 5.

Counting all these triangles, we find that there are 5 triangles in total. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
