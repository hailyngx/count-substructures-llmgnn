Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected. Let's list out the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: (1, 2, 7)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 5, 6)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 6, 7)
4. Triangle 4: (3, 8, 9)
5. Triangle 5: (5, 6, 7)
6. Triangle 6: (5, 8, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<1, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <3, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 8, 9>.
