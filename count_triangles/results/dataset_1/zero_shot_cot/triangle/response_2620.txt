Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in this graph. The triangles are as follows: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 7, 9>. The total number of triangles is [5].
