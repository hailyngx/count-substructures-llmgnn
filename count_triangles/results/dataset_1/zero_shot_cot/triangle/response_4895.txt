Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can check each possible triangle formed by any three connected nodes. Let's list these unique triangles first:

1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <3, 7, 6>
3. <3, 7, 9>
4. <4, 1, 8>
5. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
