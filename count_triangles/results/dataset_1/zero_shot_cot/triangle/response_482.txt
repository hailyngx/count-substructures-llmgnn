Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
From the given graph, let's determine the total number of triangles and also list the unique triangles.

To count the number of triangles:
1. Look for each node that has connections to two other nodes.
2. Check if there is an edge between those two other nodes as well, forming a triangle.
3. Count each triangle only once.

Based on the provided edges, the triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 2, 5>
4. <0, 2, 7>
5. <1, 2, 5>
6. <1, 2, 9>
7. <2, 4, 5>
8. <2, 4, 7>
9. <4, 5, 9>
10. <9, 8, 4>

So, there are a total of [10] triangles in this graph.
