Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph. Remember that a triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Number of Triangles: [4]

Unique Triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
