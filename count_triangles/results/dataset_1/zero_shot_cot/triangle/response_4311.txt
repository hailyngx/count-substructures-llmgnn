Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to check each possible set of three vertices and see if they form a triangle. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Consider each node as a vertex:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, 8.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6.
   - Node 2 is connected to node 0.
   - Node 3 is connected to node 1.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 9.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4.
   - Node 7 is connected to node 0.
   - Node 8 is connected to node 0.
   - Node 9 is connected to node 4.

2. Now, let's check for triangles by examining all possible triplets of nodes:
   - Triangles:
     - <0, 2, 5>
     - <0, 4, 5>
     - <0, 4, 6>
     - <0, 5, 4>
     - <0, 5, 7>
     - <0, 5, 8>
     - <1, 3, 6>
     - <4, 5, 6>
   
3. Counting unique triangles: [8]

Therefore, there are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph.
