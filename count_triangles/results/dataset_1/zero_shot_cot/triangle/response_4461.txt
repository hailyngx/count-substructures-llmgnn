Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in a graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. Let's list all the triangles in the given graph:

- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 5, 7>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles found:
