Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph:

Step 1: Identify the triangles by looking for nodes connected in a way that forms a closed loop of three edges.
Step 2: List the unique triangles found.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 3>
<1, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [2]
