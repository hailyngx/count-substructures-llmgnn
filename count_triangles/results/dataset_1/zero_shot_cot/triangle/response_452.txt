Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

To find a triangle, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Looking at the given graph, the following triangles can be identified:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <2, 0, 1>
3. <2, 0, 8>
4. <3, 4, 5>
5. <3, 5, 8>
6. <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
