Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

1. Node 0 is connected to Node 1.
2. Node 1 is connected to Nodes 0, 5, and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to Nodes 3 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to Nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to Nodes 3, 5, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1 and 2.
8. Node 7 is connected to Nodes 3, 5, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to Nodes 3, 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to Node 4.

To form a triangle, we need three nodes connected in a closed loop. Let's list the triangles:

1. <1, 5, 7>
2. <3, 4, 5>
3. <3, 7, 8>

Count of triangles = 3

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
