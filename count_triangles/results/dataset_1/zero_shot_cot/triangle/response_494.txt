Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following these steps will help us count the number of triangles:

1. Look for each node's neighbors based on the given edges:
Node 0: 3, 5, 6
Node 1: 2, 4
Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 4, 7, 8
Node 4: 1, 3, 8, 9
Node 5: 0
Node 6: 0, 2
Node 7: 2, 3
Node 8: 3, 4
Node 9: 2, 4

2. Identify triangles by checking which nodes have common neighbors:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 8>

After identifying the triangles, count the total number of triangles present in the graph. Provide this count in the format [total number of triangles].
