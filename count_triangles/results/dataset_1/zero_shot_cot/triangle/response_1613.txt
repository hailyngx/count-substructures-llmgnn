Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify each unique triangle formed by three interconnected nodes.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to each other:
   - Node 0: 2, 8
   - Node 1: 7
   - Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
   - Node 3: 5, 9
   - Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 7
   - Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
   - Node 6: 4, 5
   - Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5
   - Node 8: 0
   - Node 9: 2, 3

2. Identify triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (2, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 2: (2, 5, 7)

3. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <2, 4, 5> and <2, 5, 7>.
