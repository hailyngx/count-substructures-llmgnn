Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges. 

Let's list down the triangles by identifying the nodes that form triangles:
1. Triangle: <0, 5, 1>
2. Triangle: <3, 1, 5>
3. Triangle: <3, 5, 7>
4. Triangle: <1, 5, 8>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
