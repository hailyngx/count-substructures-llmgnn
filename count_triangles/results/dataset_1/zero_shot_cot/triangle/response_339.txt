Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

Here are the steps to find the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Identify all triangles in the graph:
   - <0, 6, 9>
   - <0, 7, 9>
   - <1, 7, 9>
   - <2, 1, 9>
   - <7, 8, 9>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles: [5]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
