Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Check for triangles involving each node.
- Triangle involving node 0: None
- Triangle involving node 1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 5, 4), (1, 9, 7)
- Triangle involving node 2: None
- Triangle involving node 3: None
- Triangle involving node 4: None
- Triangle involving node 5: None
- Triangle involving node 6: None
- Triangle involving node 7: None
- Triangle involving node 8: None
- Triangle involving node 9: None

Step 2: List the found triangles:
<1, 2, 4>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 9, 7>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles = 3

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
