Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with the following nodes: 1, 5, 6.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with the following nodes: 0, 3, 8.
3. Node 2 forms triangles with the following nodes: 3, 7, 8.
4. Node 3 forms a triangle with the nodes: 1, 2, 8.
5. Node 5 forms triangles with the following nodes: 0, 7, 9.
6. Node 6 forms a triangle with the nodes: 0, 9, 5.
7. Node 7 forms a triangle with the nodes: 2, 5.
8. Node 8 forms a triangle with the nodes: 1, 2, 3.
9. Node 9 forms a triangle with the nodes: 5, 6.

Now, counting the total number of triangles formed by the given graph, [there are 9 triangles]. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
