Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

First, let's list out all the triangles by checking every possible combination of 3 nodes connected by edges: (0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 5), (0, 4, 7), (0, 7, 9), (1, 3, 4), (1, 6, 9), (2, 3, 5), (2, 4, 7), (3, 4, 8), (3, 5, 8), (4, 5, 8), (4, 8, 9), (5, 8, 9), (7, 8, 9)

So, there are 16 unique triangles in the graph. Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
