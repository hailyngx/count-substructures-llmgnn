Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Given edges: (0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 0), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 2), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 5), (7, 2), (8, 0), (9, 5)

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.
