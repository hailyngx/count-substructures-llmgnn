Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Identify all triangles in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 2, 7>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 3, 9>
   - Triangle 4: <1, 2, 3>
   - Triangle 5: <1, 5, 9>
   - Triangle 6: <2, 3, 5>
   - Triangle 7: <2, 6, 9>
   - Triangle 8: <3, 5, 9>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles: [8]

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
