Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Given the provided list of edges:

(0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) 
(1, 2) 
(2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) 
(3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) 
(4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) 
(5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) 
(6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) 
(7, 4) 
(8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) 
(9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Let's identify the triangles:

1. <2, 4, 6>
2. <2, 6, 9>
3. <3, 6, 9>
4. <0, 3, 5>
5. <4, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [5]
