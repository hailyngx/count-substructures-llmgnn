Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Triangles involving Node 0:
   - (0, 6, 1)
   - (0, 6, 7)

2. Triangles involving Node 1:
   - (1, 6, 0)
   - (1, 6, 5)
   - (1, 6, 7)

3. Triangles involving Node 2:
   - (2, 1, 6)
   - (2, 1, 7)

4. Triangles involving Node 4:
   - None

5. Triangles involving Node 5:
   - (5, 1, 6)

6. Triangles involving Node 6:
   - (6, 0, 7)
   - (6, 1, 5)

7. Triangles involving Node 7:
   - (7, 0, 2)

8. Triangles involving Node 8:
   - None

9. Triangles involving Node 9:
   - None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8] represented uniquely as <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 1, 6>, <2, 1, 7>, <5, 1, 6>, <6, 0, 7>.
