Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start counting the triangles in this graph step by step.

Step 1: Identify all triangles formed by three connected nodes:
- Potential triangle 1: Nodes 0, 1, 4
- Potential triangle 2: Nodes 1, 3, 4
- Potential triangle 3: Nodes 2, 3, 4
- Potential triangle 4: Nodes 3, 4, 8
- Potential triangle 5: Nodes 3, 4, 9
- Potential triangle 6: Nodes 4, 5, 9
- Potential triangle 7: Nodes 8, 4, 9

Step 2: Determine which of these potential triangles are actually triangles based on the given edges:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <1, 3, 4>
- Triangle 3: <2, 3, 4>
- Triangle 4: <3, 4, 8>
- Triangle 5: <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle 6: <4, 5, 9>
- Triangle 7: <4, 8, 9>

After examining the graph, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
