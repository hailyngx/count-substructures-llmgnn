Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are interconnected by edges.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
