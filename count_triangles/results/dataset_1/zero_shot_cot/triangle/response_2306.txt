Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: 4, 7, 8
2. Nodes connected to node 1: 3, 7
3. Nodes connected to node 2: 4, 7
4. Nodes connected to node 3: 1, 7
5. Nodes connected to node 4: 0, 2, 7
6. Nodes connected to node 5: 7
7. Nodes connected to node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
8. Nodes connected to node 8: 0, 7
9. Nodes connected to node 9: 7

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <2, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
