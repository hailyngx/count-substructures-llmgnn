Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can analyze each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes.

The possible triangles in this graph are:
1. <2, 3, 6>
2. <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this given graph is 2.
