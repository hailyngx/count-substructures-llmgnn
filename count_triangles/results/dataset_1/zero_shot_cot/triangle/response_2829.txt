Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's list the triangles found:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <0, 2, 5>
4. <1, 2, 5>
5. <1, 2, 7>
6. <1, 2, 8>
7. <1, 5, 8>
8. <4, 6, 7>

Now, count the total number of unique triangles found. The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
