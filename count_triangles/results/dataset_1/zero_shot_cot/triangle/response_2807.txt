Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify all possible triangles by looking for nodes that are connected with each other. 

Let's list the triangles first:
1. <1, 6, 9>
2. <1, 8, 9>
3. <1, 9, 6>
4. <8, 1, 9>
5. <8, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
