Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can analyze each node and check for triangles involving that node. Here are the steps for finding the total number of triangles along with the unique triangles represented:

1. **Node 0 (Neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7)**
   - Triangle <0, 2, 4>

2. **Node 1 (Neighbors: 3, 8)**
   - No triangles can be formed involving Node 1.

3. **Node 2 (Neighbors: 0, 6, 8, 9)**
   - Triangle <0, 2, 8>
   - Triangle <0, 2, 9>
   - Triangle <2, 3, 9>

4. **Node 3 (Neighbors: 0, 1, 9)**
   - No new triangles can be formed involving Node 3.

5. **Node 4 (Neighbors: 0, 9)**
   - No new triangles can be formed involving Node 4.

6. **Node 6 (Neighbors: 2)**
   - No triangles can be formed involving Node 6.

7. **Node 7 (Neighbors: 0)**
   - No triangles can be formed involving Node 7.

8. **Node 8 (Neighbors: 1, 2)**
   - No new triangles can be formed involving Node 8.

9. **Node 9 (Neighbors: 2, 3, 4)**
   - No new triangles can be formed involving Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <2, 3, 9>.
