Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 4, 3>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 6, 1>
4. <3, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
