Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Check each possible triangle formed by the 10 nodes:

- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 7)
- Triangle 2: (1, 2, 9)
- Triangle 3: (2, 3, 5)
- Triangle 4: (2, 5, 7)
- Triangle 5: (1, 7, 4)
- Triangle 6: (3, 4, 9)

2. Calculate the number of triangles present:

- We found 6 triangles in the given graph.
