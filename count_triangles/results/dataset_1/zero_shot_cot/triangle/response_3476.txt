Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 3, 6>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <8, 9, 2>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
