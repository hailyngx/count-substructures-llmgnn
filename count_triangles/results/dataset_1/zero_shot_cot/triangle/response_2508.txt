Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

First, let's list down all the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <2, 3, 5>
3. <2, 6, 9>
4. <3, 5, 8>
5. <3, 6, 9>
6. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
