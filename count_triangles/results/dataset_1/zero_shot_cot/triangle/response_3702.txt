Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <6, 8, 9>.
