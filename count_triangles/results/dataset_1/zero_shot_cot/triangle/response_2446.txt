Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. In this graph, we have the following triangles:
- Triangle 1: <3, 5, 7>
- Triangle 2: <3, 7, 9>
- Triangle 3: <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
