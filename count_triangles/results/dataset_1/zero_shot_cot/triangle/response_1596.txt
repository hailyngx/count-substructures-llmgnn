Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Look at each node and its neighbors to find triangles:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6.
     - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 3)
     - Triangle 2: (0, 1, 6)
     - Triangle 3: (0, 3, 5)
     - Triangle 4: (0, 5, 6)
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
     - Triangle 5: (1, 0, 3)
     - Triangle 6: (1, 0, 6)
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7. No triangles with node 2.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9. No additional triangles with node 3.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
     - Triangle 7: (4, 2, 6)
     - Triangle 8: (4, 5, 0)
     - Triangle 9: (4, 5, 6)
     - Triangle 10: (4, 6, 8)
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 4. No additional triangles with node 5.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8.
     - Triangle 11: (6, 0, 1)
     - Triangle 12: (6, 0, 2)
     - Triangle 13: (6, 0, 4)
     - Triangle 14: (6, 0, 8)
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 4. No additional triangles with node 7.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6. No additional triangles with node 8.
   - Node 9 is connected to node 3. No triangles with node 9.

2. Count the total number of unique triangles:
   - Total unique triangles: [14]

Therefore, there are 14 unique triangles in the given graph.
