Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
