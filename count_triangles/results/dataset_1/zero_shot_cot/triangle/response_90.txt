Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step in finding the triangles:

1. Starting from node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
   - Nodes 1 and 6 are not directly connected to each other.

2. Moving to node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9.
   - Checking for triangles involving node 1:
     - Triangle <0, 1, 6> is found.

3. Proceeding to other nodes:
   - Trying to find more triangles by exploring other nodes:
     - Triangle <2, 4, 7> is found.
     - Triangle <2, 7, 8> is found.
     - Triangle <3, 4, 7> is found.
     - Triangle <4, 6, 9> is found.
     - Triangle <4, 7, 9> is found.
     - Triangle <6, 8, 9> is found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
