Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Let's denote the nodes from 0 to 9 as {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. 

Now, we will identify all the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 4, 5>
3. Triangle 3: <0, 5, 6>
4. Triangle 4: <1, 5, 6>
5. Triangle 5: <2, 4, 8>
6. Triangle 6: <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
