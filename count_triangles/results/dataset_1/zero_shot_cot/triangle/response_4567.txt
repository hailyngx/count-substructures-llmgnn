Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. Here are the triangles in the given graph:

1. <1, 4, 5>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <2, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
