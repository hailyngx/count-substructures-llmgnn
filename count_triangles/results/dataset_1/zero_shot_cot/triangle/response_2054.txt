Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. Let's go step-by-step to find all the triangles:

1. Look for triangles formed by nodes connected by edges:
- Triangle 1: Nodes (0, 5, 6) form a triangle.
- Triangle 2: Nodes (2, 4, 5) form a triangle.
- Triangle 3: Nodes (2, 8, 9) form a triangle.
- Triangle 4: Nodes (4, 5, 0) form a triangle.
- Triangle 5: Nodes (7, 8, 9) form a triangle.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

The total number of triangles in the graph is: [5]
