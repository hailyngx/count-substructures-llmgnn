Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. Let's analyze the graph based on the given edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
(0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8)
(1, 8)
(2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9)
(3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8)
(4, 3)
(5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9)
(6, 0) (6, 9)
(7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3)
(8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3)
(9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6)
```

Now, let's identify the triangles (cycles of length 3) in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 3, 8>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <2, 3, 9>
7. <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
