Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify the unique triangles using the provided edges. Let's start by analyzing the possible triangles in the graph:

1. For node 0: (0, 4), (0, 8), (4, 0), (4, 8) form the possible edges for triangles.
2. For node 1: (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 1), (5, 1) form the possible edges for triangles.
3. For node 2: (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 9), (4, 2), (6, 2), (9, 2) form the possible edges for triangles.
4. For node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4) form the possible edges for triangles.
5. For node 5: (1, 5), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6) form the possible edges for triangles.
6. For node 6: (2, 6), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 6), (9, 6) form the possible edges for triangles.
7. For node 7: (6, 7) forms a possible edge for triangles.
8. For node 8: (0, 8), (4, 8), (8, 0), (8, 4) form the possible edges for triangles.
9. For node 9: (2, 9), (4, 9), (6, 9), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6) form the possible edges for triangles.

After identifying all the possible triangles formed by the edges above, we find the following unique triangles: <2, 4, 6> and <2, 4, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
