Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the edges provided. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other directly or indirectly.

Let's list down all the unique triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <2, 7, 3>
4. <2, 9, 3>

Count of triangles: [4]
