Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the triangles in the given graph, i.e., the sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. 

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <2, 6, 8>
2. <2, 6, 7>
3. <2, 3, 8>

Therefore, there are total [3] triangles in this graph.
