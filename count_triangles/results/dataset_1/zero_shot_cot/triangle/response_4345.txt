Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph, we can follow the steps below to identify the triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.

Now, we can identify the triangles in the graph by checking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the unique triangles found and count them.

The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <2, 3, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
