Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: **[7]**

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 8, 9>
