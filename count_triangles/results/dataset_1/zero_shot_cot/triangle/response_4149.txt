Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all interconnected with each other. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Identify all triangles in the graph based on the given edges:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 5, 4)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 5, 7)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 4: (0, 7, 8)
   - Triangle 5: (0, 7, 9)
   - Triangle 6: (2, 1, 8)
   - Triangle 7: (2, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 8: (2, 4, 7)
   - Triangle 9: (5, 4, 7)
   - Triangle 10: (6, 0, 7)
   - Triangle 11: (7, 8, 9)

2. List the unique triangles found:
   - <0, 5, 4>
   - <0, 5, 7>
   - <0, 6, 7>
   - <0, 7, 8>
   - <0, 7, 9>
   - <2, 1, 8>
   - <2, 4, 5>
   - <2, 4, 7>
   - <5, 4, 7>
   - <6, 0, 7>
   - <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in total. Hence, the output is [11].
