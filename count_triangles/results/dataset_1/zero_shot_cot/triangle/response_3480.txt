Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given Graph:

    Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    Edges: (0, 7), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 4), (5, 6), 
           (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 6), (8, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Let's find the total number of triangles and list them:
