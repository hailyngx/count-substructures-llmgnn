Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Find neighbors for each node
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: No neighbors
- Node 2: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 4, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4

Step 2: Identify triangles
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 9, 2>
- <2, 9, 3>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 7, 8>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles and list unique triangles
There are a total of 5 triangles in the graph:
