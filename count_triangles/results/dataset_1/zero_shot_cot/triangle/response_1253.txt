Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other in a triangular manner. Let's go step by step:

1. Node pairs that form triangles:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>

2. Total number of triangles: [3]
