Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by listing all possible triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
6. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
7. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
8. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
9. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
10. Triangle <3, 5, 7>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:
