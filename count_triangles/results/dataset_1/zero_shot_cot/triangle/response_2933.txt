Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7. There is a triangle <0, 2, 6>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9. There is a triangle <1, 7, 8>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 1.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8. There is a triangle <0, 2, 6>.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6. There is a triangle <1, 7, 8>.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.

From the analysis above, we have identified two unique triangles: <0, 2, 6> and <1, 7, 8>. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
