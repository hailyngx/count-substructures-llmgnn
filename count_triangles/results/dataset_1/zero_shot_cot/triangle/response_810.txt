Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected. Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: 5, 6
2. Nodes connected to node 1: 2, 4, 7, 9
3. Nodes connected to node 2: 1, 8
4. Nodes connected to node 3: 8
5. Nodes connected to node 4: 1, 5
6. Nodes connected to node 5: 0, 4, 7
7. Nodes connected to node 6: 0, 9
8. Nodes connected to node 7: 1, 5
9. Nodes connected to node 8: 2, 3, 9
10. Nodes connected to node 9: 1, 6, 8

Now, we can identify the triangles:
- Triangle involving nodes 0, 5, and 6.
- Triangle involving nodes 1, 4, and 5.
- Triangle involving nodes 1, 7, and 9.
- Triangle involving nodes 2, 8, and 9.

Therefore, we have found 4 unique triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
