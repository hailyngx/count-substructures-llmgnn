Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected by edges. Let's find the triangles step by step:

1. First, let's identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 1, 8>
   - Triangle 3: <1, 2, 8>
   - Triangle 4: <1, 2, 9>
   - Triangle 5: <0, 4, 8>

2. Now, count the total number of unique triangles: [5]

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
