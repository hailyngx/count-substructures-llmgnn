Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the given edges.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
1. <2, 4, 6>
2. <2, 6, 9>
3. <2, 7, 9>
4. <4, 6, 9>
5. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
