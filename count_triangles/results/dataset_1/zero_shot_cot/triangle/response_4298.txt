Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 4.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 1>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle 3: <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle 4: <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle 5: <3, 7, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles, we find:  
[5] triangles.
