Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph:
1. Triangle <0, 5, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 6, 1>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 2>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
7. Triangle <3, 4, 6>
8. Triangle <3, 8, 2>
9. Triangle <3, 8, 5>
10. Triangle <3, 9, 7>
11. Triangle <4, 6, 2>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in total in the given graph. Hence, the total number of triangles is [11].
