Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph based on the given edges.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <1, 4, 9>
2. <1, 7, 2>
3. <1, 9, 3>
4. <3, 4, 9>
5. <4, 5, 9>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, the number of triangles is [5].
