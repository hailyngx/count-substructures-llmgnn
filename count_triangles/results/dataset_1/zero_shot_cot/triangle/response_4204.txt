Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify them step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 4, 6)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 6, 7)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 4, 7)
4. Triangle 4: (1, 6, 8)

Hence, there are 4 triangles in total. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
