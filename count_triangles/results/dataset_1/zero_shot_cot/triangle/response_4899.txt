Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: <0, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, and <4, 5, 9>.
