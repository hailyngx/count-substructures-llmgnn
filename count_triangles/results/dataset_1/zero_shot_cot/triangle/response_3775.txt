Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. By looking at the edges, we can see that triangles can be formed when three nodes are connected by edges to form a closed loop.
2. We need to check each possible combination of three nodes to see if they form a triangle.

The total number of triangles inside brackets is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, and <1, 2, 7>.
