Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8)
   - Possible triangles involving node 0: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>

2. Nodes connected to node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9)
   - Possible triangles involving node 1: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 9>

3. Nodes connected to node 2: (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7)
   - Possible triangles involving node 2: <0, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 1>

4. Nodes connected to node 3: (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9)
   - Possible triangles involving node 3: <0, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 8, 9>

5. Nodes connected to node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2)
   - Possible triangles involving node 4: <0, 2, 4>

6. Nodes connected to node 5: (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 8)
   - No triangles can be formed with node 5.

7. Nodes connected to node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 7)
   - Possible triangles involving node 6: <1, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 7>

8. Nodes connected to node 7: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 6), (7, 8)
   - Possible triangles involving node 7: <1, 2, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>

9. Nodes connected to node 8: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 9)
   - Possible triangles involving node 8: <0, 3, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 7>, <7, 8, 9>

10. Nodes connected to node 9: (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 8)
    - No triangles can be formed with node 9.

After analyzing all connections, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 1>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 7>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
