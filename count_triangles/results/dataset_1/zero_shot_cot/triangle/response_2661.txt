Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Look at each node and find the neighbors connected by edges:
   - Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 2, 5, 9
   - Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 9
   - Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
   - Node 3: Neighbors are 2, 6, 9
   - Node 4: Neighbor is 2
   - Node 5: Neighbor is 0
   - Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 3
   - Node 7: Neighbor is 9
   - Node 8: Neighbor is 2
   - Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 7

2. Check for triangles by examining each set of three nodes:
   - Possible triangles: (0, 1, 9), (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 9), (0, 2, 5), (0, 2, 9), (0, 5, 9), (1, 9, 0), (2, 0, 5), (2, 0, 9), (2, 4, 6), (3, 2, 6), (3, 2, 9), (6, 2, 3), (9, 0, 1), (9, 0, 3), (9, 0, 7), (9, 1, 3), (9, 1, 7), (9, 3, 7)

3. Count the total number of triangles: [4]
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 4. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 5>, and <2, 4, 6>.
