Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Calculating the total number of triangles in the given graph involves finding all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

By examining the edges in the graph, we can see that the triangles formed are:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 3, 7>
4. <1, 5, 7>
5. <1, 5, 8>
6. <1, 6, 7>
7. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
