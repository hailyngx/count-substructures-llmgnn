Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected. Below are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 2, 8>
5. <6, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [5]
