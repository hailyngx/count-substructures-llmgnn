Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, here are the triangles found in the graph:

- Triangles: [6]

The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 7>.
