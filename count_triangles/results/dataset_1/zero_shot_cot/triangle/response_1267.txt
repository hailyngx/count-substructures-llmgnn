Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected by edges. We can do this by examining all possible combinations of three nodes and checking if there are edges connecting all three nodes.

After analyzing the given graph, we can list the triangles as follows:
1. <0, 7, 9>
2. <1, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
