Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. Triangle with 3 connected nodes:  
   - Possible triangles: (0, 4, 6), (2, 5, 6), (2, 6, 7), (4, 6, 7), (2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 8), (4, 6, 8), (2, 7, 8).

Counting these unique triangles, we find [8] triangles in total.
