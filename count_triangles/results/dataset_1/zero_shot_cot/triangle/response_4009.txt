Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. (0, 2, 4)
2. (0, 2, 9)
3. (1, 3, 9)
4. (2, 4, 9)

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, and <2, 4, 9>.
