Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
