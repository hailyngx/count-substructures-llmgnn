Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:
- First, let's look at each node individually to see how many triangles can be formed with that node.
- Node 0: Possible triangles = (0, 2, 6), (0, 2, 8)
- Node 1: Possible triangles = (1, 4, 7)
- Node 2: Possible triangles = (0, 2, 4), (2, 4, 6)
- Node 3: No triangles can be formed with node 3.
- Node 4: Possible triangles = (1, 4, 7), (2, 4, 5), (4, 5, 8), (4, 8, 9)
- Node 5: No triangles can be formed with node 5.
- Node 6: Possible triangles = (0, 2, 6), (2, 4, 6)
- Node 7: No triangles can be formed with node 7.
- Node 8: No triangles can be formed with node 8.
- Node 9: No triangles can be formed with node 9.

The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 8>, and <4, 8, 9>.
Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
