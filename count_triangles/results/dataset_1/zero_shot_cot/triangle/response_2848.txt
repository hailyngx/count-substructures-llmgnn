Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three vertices that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step by step:

1. Vertices that form triangles:
    - Triangle 1: (1, 2, 5)
    - Triangle 2: (5, 6, 7)

So, there are a total of 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
