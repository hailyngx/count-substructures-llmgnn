Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles present in the graph:
(0, 2, 4)
(0, 3, 9)
(0, 4, 5)
(1, 3, 9)
(1, 4, 6)
(2, 4, 7)
(3, 4, 7) 
(3, 5, 9)
(4, 5, 8)

Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles in the graph: [9]
