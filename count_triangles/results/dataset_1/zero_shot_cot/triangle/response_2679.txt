Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's go step-by-step. 

First, let's list all triangles. 

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

There are 7 triangles in total. So, the output should be [7].
