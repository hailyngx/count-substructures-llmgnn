Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Look for all the triangles formed by selecting three nodes that are all connected to each other.

    a. <0, 1, 5>
    b. <0, 1, 7>
    c. <1, 3, 9>
    d. <1, 5, 2>
    e. <2, 5, 7>
    f. <3, 7, 1>
    g. <3, 7, 2>
    h. <4, 8, 9>
    i. <6, 7, 9>
    j. <7, 1, 0>
    k. <9, 1, 3>
    l. <9, 4, 8>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles found: [12]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 12.
