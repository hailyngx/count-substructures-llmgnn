Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. Let's examine each node and its connections to identify the triangles.

1. Triangle with Node 0:
   - (0, 4), (0, 6), (4, 6)

2. Triangle with Node 2:
   - (2, 1), (2, 7), (1, 7)

3. Triangle with Node 3:
   - (3, 5), (3, 7), (5, 7)

4. Triangle with Node 4:
   - (4, 0), (4, 6), (0, 6)
   - (4, 7), (4, 8), (7, 8)

5. Triangle with Node 5:
   - (5, 3), (5, 8), (3, 8)

6. Triangle with Node 6:
   - (6, 0), (6, 2), (0, 2)
   - (6, 4), (6, 7), (4, 7)

7. Triangle with Node 7:
   - (7, 2), (7, 3), (2, 3)
   - (7, 4), (7, 6), (4, 6)
   - (7, 9), (7, 4), (4, 9)

8. Triangle with Node 8:
   - (8, 2), (8, 3), (2, 3)
   - (8, 4), (8, 5), (4, 5)

9. Triangle with Node 9:
   - (9, 0), (9, 5), (0, 5)
   - (9, 7), (9, 4), (7, 4)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9] in the following unique combinations: <0, 4, 6>, <2, 1, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 3, 8>, <0, 2, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 5, 8>.
