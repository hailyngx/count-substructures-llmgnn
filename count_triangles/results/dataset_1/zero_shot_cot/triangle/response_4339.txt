Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the sets of three nodes that are interconnected. Here are the steps to solve this:

1. Analyze Each Node:
   - Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 4, 5, 9
   - Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 6, 9
   - Node 3: Neighbors are 7, 9
   - Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 8
   - Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 9
   - Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 7, 9
   - Node 7: Neighbors are 3, 6
   - Node 8: Neighbor is 4
   - Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 5, 6

2. Identify Triangles:
   - <0, 1, 9>
   - <0, 5, 9>
   - <1, 6, 9>
   - <3, 7, 9>
   - <4, 0, 9>
   - <6, 7, 9>

3. Total Number of Triangles: [6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 6.
