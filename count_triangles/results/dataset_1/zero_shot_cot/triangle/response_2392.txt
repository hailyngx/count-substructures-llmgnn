Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <3, 4, 8>
6. <3, 5, 8>
7. <3, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
