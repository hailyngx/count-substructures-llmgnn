Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected with each other.

After examining the provided edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <1, 4, 6>
6. <1, 4, 5>
7. <2, 4, 5>
8. <2, 5, 8>
9. <4, 7, 9>
10. <4, 5, 7>
11. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
