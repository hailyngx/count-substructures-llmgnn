Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
