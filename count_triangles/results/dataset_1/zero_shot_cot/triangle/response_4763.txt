Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all the triangles by finding nodes that form closed loops of length 3.
2. Check if each identified triangle is unique.

Now, let's identify the triangles in the provided graph. Since the graph is given with edges, it's easier to visualize the triangles:

Triangles:
1. <1, 5, 7>
2. <1, 5, 8>
3. <1, 9, 4>
4. <5, 7, 8>
5. <8, 9, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. So, the output is:
[5]
