Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Nodes with connections:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6
- Node 3: 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 3, 7

2. Checking for triangles:
- <0, 6, 7>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <2, 1, 6>
- <2, 6, 3>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <7, 6, 0>
- <7, 6, 1>
- <7, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 9. 
So, the answer is: [9]
