Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph
- A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.
- Let's check every combination of three nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Triplet 1: (0, 1, 2)
- Nodes 0, 1, and 2 form a triangle, so we have <0, 1, 2>.

Triplet 2: (1, 2, 3)
- Nodes 1, 2, and 3 do not form a triangle.

Triplet 3: (1, 2, 4)
- Nodes 1, 2, and 4 do not form a triangle.

Triplet 4: (1, 3, 5)
- Nodes 1, 3, and 5 do not form a triangle.

Triplet 5: (1, 3, 6)
- Nodes 1, 3, and 6 do not form a triangle.

Triplet 6: (1, 5, 6)
- Nodes 1, 5, and 6 form a triangle, so we have <1, 5, 6>.

Triplet 7: (2, 3, 4)
- Nodes 2, 3, and 4 do not form a triangle.

Triplet 8: (6, 8, 9)
- Nodes 6, 8, and 9 form a triangle, so we have <6, 8, 9>.

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles
- From the above calculations, we found 3 unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 5, 6>, and <6, 8, 9>.
- Output the total number of triangles: [3]
