Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Firstly, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle consists of 3 nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

From the given edges, we can determine the following triangles:
1. (2, 3, 8)
2. (2, 5, 8)
3. (2, 5, 9)
4. (3, 5, 8)
5. (5, 7, 8)

The total number of triangles in the graph is [5]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, and <5, 7, 8>.
