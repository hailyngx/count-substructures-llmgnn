Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Determine triangles by checking each possible combination of nodes connected by edges.

Let's go through all possible triangles:
1. Triangle 1: (0, 3, 7)
2. Triangle 2: (3, 5, 8)
3. Triangle 3: (5, 8, 9)
4. Triangle 4: (6, 1, 2)
5. Triangle 5: (6, 1, 9)
6. Triangle 6: (6, 2, 9)
  
Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
