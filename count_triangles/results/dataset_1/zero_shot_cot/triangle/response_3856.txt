Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will analyze the connections between nodes.

Nodes connected to each other:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3
- Node 7: 1, 2
- Node 8: 0, 4

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- <1, 6, 2>
- <1, 7, 2>
- <1, 6, 3>
- <2, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [4].
