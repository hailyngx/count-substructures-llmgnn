Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: Degree = 4
- Node 1: Degree = 1
- Node 2: Degree = 3
- Node 3: Degree = 3
- Node 4: Degree = 4
- Node 5: Degree = 3
- Node 6: Degree = 2
- Node 7: Degree = 5
- Node 8: Degree = 1
- Node 9: Degree = 5

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles using the degree of nodes.
- Count of triangles = 1/6 * Î£(degree of node i * (degree of node i - 1) * (degree of node i - 2))

Calculation:
= 1/6 * [4*(4-1)*(4-2) + 1*(1-1)*(1-2) + 3*(3-1)*(3-2) + 3*(3-1)*(3-2) + 4*(4-1)*(4-2) + 3*(3-1)*(3-2) + 2*(2-1)*(2-2) + 5*(5-1)*(5-2) + 1*(1-1)*(1-2) + 5*(5-1)*(5-2)]
= 1/6 * [24 + 0 + 12 + 12 + 24 + 6 + 0 + 60 + 0 + 60]
= 1/6 * 198
= 33

Therefore, there are a total of 33 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are [0, 2, 4], [0, 3, 9], [0, 4, 7], [0, 5, 2], [0, 5, 4], [0, 5, 7], [0, 7, 4], [0, 7, 9], [2, 4, 9], [3, 4, 9], [4, 5, 7], [4, 7, 9], and [7, 8, 9].
