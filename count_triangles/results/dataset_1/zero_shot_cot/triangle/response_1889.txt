Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles present within the graph by looking at each combination of three nodes that are all interconnected.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles that exist within the graph.

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <0, 1, 5>
4. <0, 3, 5>
5. <0, 4, 8>
6. <3, 5, 7>
7. <3, 6, 7>
8. <4, 0, 8>
9. <5, 7, 6>
10. <8, 1, 4>
11. <8, 1, 9>
12. <8, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
