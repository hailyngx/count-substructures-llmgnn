Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the steps to find the total number of triangles:

1. For each node, check if there are two other nodes that are connected to it forming a triangle.
2. Count the total number of triangles formed by all possible combinations of nodes.

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <2, 5, 9>
4. <5, 6, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
