Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's analyze the graph and identify the triangles:

1. Possible triangles involving node 0:
   - No triangles involving node 0.

2. Possible triangles involving node 1:
   - Triangle: <1, 2, 3>

3. Possible triangles involving node 2:
   - No more triangles involving node 2.

4. Possible triangles involving node 3:
   - No more triangles involving node 3.

5. Possible triangles involving node 4:
   - No triangles involving node 4.

6. Possible triangles involving node 5:
   - No triangles involving node 5.

7. Possible triangles involving node 7:
   - No triangles involving node 7.

8. Possible triangles involving node 9:
   - No triangles involving node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1]. We found one triangle: <1, 2, 3>.
