Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles in the given graph by checking all possible combinations of nodes connected by edges:

<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 8, 1>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 8, 7>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 9, 3>
<2, 0, 1>
<3, 1, 8>
<3, 1, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<6, 9, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [13]
