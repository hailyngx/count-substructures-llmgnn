Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for closed loops of length 3. These closed loops represent triangles in the graph.

Let's count the triangles step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8. There are no triangles involving node 0 directly.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5. There are no triangles involving node 1 directly.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 5. There are no triangles involving node 2 directly.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 7. There are no triangles involving node 3 directly.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 7. There is one triangle involving nodes 1, 4, and 7: <1, 4, 7>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9. There are no triangles involving node 5 directly.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 4. There are no triangles involving node 6 directly.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 8, and 9. There is one triangle involving nodes 4, 7, and 8: <4, 7, 8>.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7. There are no triangles involving node 8 directly.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 7. There are no triangles involving node 9 directly.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 7> and <4, 7, 8>.
