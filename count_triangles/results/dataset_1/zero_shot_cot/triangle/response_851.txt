Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 11 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<7, 0, 1>
<8, 3, 9>
<9, 7, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [11].
