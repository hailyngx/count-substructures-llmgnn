Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

List of triangles:
1. <2, 5, 6>
2. <4, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
