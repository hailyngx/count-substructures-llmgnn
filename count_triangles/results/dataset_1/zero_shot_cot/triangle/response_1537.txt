Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles step by step:

1. Possible triangles involving Node 1:
   - Triangle <1, 5, 6>

2. Possible triangles involving Node 2:
   - No triangles involving Node 2.

3. Possible triangles involving Node 3:
   - No triangles involving Node 3.

4. Possible triangles involving Node 4:
   - No triangles involving Node 4.

5. Possible triangles involving Node 5:
   - Triangle <1, 5, 6>
   - Triangle <3, 5, 9>

6. Possible triangles involving Node 6:
   - Triangle <1, 5, 6>
   - Triangle <3, 5, 9>

7. Possible triangles involving Node 7:
   - No triangles involving Node 7.

8. Possible triangles involving Node 8:
   - No triangles involving Node 8.

9. Possible triangles involving Node 9:
   - Triangle <3, 5, 9>

From the above analysis, we found the following unique triangles:
<1, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
