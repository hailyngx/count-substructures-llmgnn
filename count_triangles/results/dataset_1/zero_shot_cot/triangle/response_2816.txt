Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed using the edges provided. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Identify all the triangles by looking for nodes that form interconnected triangles.
2. List the unique triangles found.
3. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <2, 4, 8>
5. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
