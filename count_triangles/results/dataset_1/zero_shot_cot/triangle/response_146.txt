Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected in a way that forms triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected in a loop. Let's list the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 6, 2>
2. <0, 6, 4>
3. <0, 9, 0>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <2, 4, 6>
6. <2, 4, 7>
7. <4, 6, 2>
8. <4, 6, 7>
9. <6, 2, 7>

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
