Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Taking account of the given graph, we can determine the number of triangles it contains by checking all possible combinations of three nodes. Let's list the triangles:  

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 0, 7>
5. <6, 7, 9>
6. <7, 2, 6>
7. <6, 8, 9>
8. <6, 7, 8>
9. <6, 7, 8>
10. <6, 8, 9>
11. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
