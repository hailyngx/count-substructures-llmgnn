Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can find the number of triangles by looking for cycles of length 3.

Let's list out the triangles:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
