Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph as an adjacency list:

0: [3, 5, 8]
1: [2, 7]
2: [1, 9]
3: [0, 9]
4: [5, 7, 8]
5: [0, 4]
6: [7]
7: [1, 4, 6]
8: [0, 4]
9: [2, 3]

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:
Triangles: [<0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 7, 4>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
