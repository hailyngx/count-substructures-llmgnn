Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are interconnected. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
2. Nodes connected to Node 1: 0, 5, 7
3. Nodes connected to Node 2: 0, 7
4. Nodes connected to Node 4: 0, 5
5. Nodes connected to Node 5: 1, 4, 7
6. Nodes connected to Node 6: 0, 7
7. Nodes connected to Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6

Now, we can check for triangles formed by these interconnected nodes:

1. Triangles with Node 0:
   - <0, 1, 7>
   - <0, 2, 7>
   - <0, 4, 5>
   - <0, 6, 7>

2. Triangle with Node 1:
   - <1, 0, 7>

3. Triangle with Node 5:
   - <5, 1, 7>
   - <5, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
