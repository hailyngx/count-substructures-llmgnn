Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 1
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 5

Step 2: Identify triangles in the graph.
- <0, 4, 9>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 9, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of triangles.
[8] 

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in this graph.
