Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes {i, j, k} where there is an edge between every pair of nodes. Let's find all the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 7, 9>
4. Triangle <0, 9, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 4, 3>
6. Triangle <2, 9, 5>
7. Triangle <3, 0, 4>
8. Triangle <3, 4, 1>
9. Triangle <4, 1, 3>
10. Triangle <7, 0, 8>
11. Triangle <7, 0, 9>
12. Triangle <7, 8, 0>
13. Triangle <7, 8, 9>
14. Triangle <7, 9, 0>
15. Triangle <7, 9, 8>
16. Triangle <8, 7, 0>
17. Triangle <8, 7, 9>
18. Triangle <8, 9, 7>
19. Triangle <9, 0, 7>
20. Triangle <9, 2, 5>
21. Triangle <9, 5, 2>
22. Triangle <9, 7, 0>
23. Triangle <9, 7, 8>
24. Triangle <9, 8, 7>

Therefore, there are 24 triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [24].
