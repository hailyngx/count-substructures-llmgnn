Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can start by examining all possible triangles formed by the edges provided.

1. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 6>
6. Triangle <3, 6, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 7>
8. Triangle <4, 6, 8>
9. Triangle <5, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
