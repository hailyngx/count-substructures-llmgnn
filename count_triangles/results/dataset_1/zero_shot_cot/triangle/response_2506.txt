Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
In order to count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges.

From the given edges, we can determine the following triangles:
1. <0, 5, 2>
2. <0, 5, 3>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <1, 2, 3>
5. <3, 5, 2>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
