Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles by examining each group of three nodes and checking if they form a triangle. The nodes involved in each edge are as follows:
- Node 0 with edges: 1, 3
- Node 1 with edges: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2 with edges: 1, 5
- Node 3 with edges: 0, 4
- Node 4 with edges: 3, 5
- Node 5 with edges: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6 with edges: 1
- Node 7 with edges: 9
- Node 8 with edges: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9 with edges: 1, 5, 7, 8

Let's list the triangles we can form:
- <1, 5, 8>
- <1, 5, 9>

So, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
