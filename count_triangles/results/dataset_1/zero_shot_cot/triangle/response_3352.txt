Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. For each node pair that share a common neighbor, we check if there is an edge connecting these two nodes directly. This forms a triangle.

2. List of unique triangles:
   - <0, 4, 8>
   - <0, 7, 9>
   - <1, 2, 7>
   - <1, 7, 9>
   - <4, 5, 7>
   - <4, 7, 8>

3. Total number of triangles: [6]
