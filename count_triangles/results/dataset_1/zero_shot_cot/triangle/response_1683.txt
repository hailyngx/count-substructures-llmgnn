Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Count the total number of triangles in the graph.

Step 2: Identify the unique triangles in the graph.

Let's start the process:

Step 1:
From the given graph, we need to count the total number of triangles.

Step 2:
- A triangle consists of 3 nodes connected by edges.
- To find a triangle, we look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected by edges.

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles and identify the unique triangles.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is: [3]

The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 2, 3> <3, 4, 5> <6, 7, 9>
