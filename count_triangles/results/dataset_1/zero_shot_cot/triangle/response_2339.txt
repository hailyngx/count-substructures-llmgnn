Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 8, but they are not connected to each other.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 6, but they are not connected to any other node.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 9. Among these, nodes 3, 5, and 7 are connected to each other, but node 9 is not connected to these three nodes.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5, but they are not connected to each other.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8. Among these, nodes 0 and 8 are connected to each other, but node 6 is not connected to these two nodes.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 3, but they are not connected to each other.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9. Among these, nodes 4, 8, and 9 form a triangle as they are all connected to each other.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9, but they are not connected to each other.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7. Among these, nodes 4, 6, and 7 form a triangle as they are all connected to each other.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7. Among these, nodes 6 and 7 are connected to each other, but node 2 is not connected to these two nodes.

Therefore, the total number of unique triangles in the given graph is [2]. The triangles found are <4, 6, 8> and <4, 6, 7>.
