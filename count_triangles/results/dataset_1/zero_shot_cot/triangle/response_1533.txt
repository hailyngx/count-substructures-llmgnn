Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique combinations of three nodes that form triangles. Let's start by listing the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 6, 7>
2. <2, 3, 4>
3. <6, 7, 0>
4. <6, 7, 1>
5. <6, 9, 2>
6. <6, 9, 3>
7. <6, 9, 4>

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [7]
