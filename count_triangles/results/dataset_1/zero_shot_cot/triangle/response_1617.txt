Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each set of three nodes that are connected to each other. 

Examining the given edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 2>
4. Triangle <0, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
