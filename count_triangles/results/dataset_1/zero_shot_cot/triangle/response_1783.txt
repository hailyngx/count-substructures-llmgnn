Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes. Let's go step-by-step:
1. From the given edges, we can deduce the following connections between nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8.
   - Node 3 is connected to node 2.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
   - Node 9 is connected to node 5.

2. Now, let's identify the triangles by looking for nodes that form triangular connections:
   - Triangle 1: (1, 2, 8)
   - Triangle 2: (1, 2, 4)
   - Triangle 3: (2, 4, 7)
   - Triangle 4: (6, 7, 4)

3. Counting the number of triangles found, we have 4 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 7>, and <6, 7, 4>.
