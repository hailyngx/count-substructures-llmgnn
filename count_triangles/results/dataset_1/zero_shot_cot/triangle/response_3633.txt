Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the total number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
2. Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 2, and 5.
3. Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 1, and 5.
4. Node 3 has connections with nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 3.
6. Node 5 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 2.
7. Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 8.
8. Node 7 has connections with nodes 0, 8.
9. Node 8 has connections with nodes 3, 6, 7.
10. Node 9 has connections with nodes 0, 3.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 4, 3>
- <0, 5, 1>
- <0, 6, 3>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 9, 3>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <3, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
