Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 3, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
