Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go through the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 4.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 3.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 8.

Let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 7, 1>
2. <0, 7, 2>
3. <0, 7, 8>
4. <0, 8, 9>
5. <0, 9, 2>
6. <0, 9, 5>
7. <1, 2, 5>
8. <9, 2, 5>
9. <9, 2, 1>
10. <9, 2, 7>
11. <9, 2, 0>
12. <9, 5, 0>
13. <9, 5, 2>
14. <9, 0, 7>
15. <9, 0, 8>
16. <9, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are [16] triangles in the given graph.
