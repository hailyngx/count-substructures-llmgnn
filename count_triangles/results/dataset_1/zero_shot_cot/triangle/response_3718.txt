Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the triangles in the given graph.
1. (0, 3, 1)
2. (0, 3, 5)
3. (0, 5, 4)
4. (0, 5, 1)
5. (0, 6, 9)
6. (1, 5, 4)
7. (1, 5, 8)
8. (2, 5, 4)
9. (4, 5, 8)
10. (4, 5, 7)
11. (4, 8, 7)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.
There are 11 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
