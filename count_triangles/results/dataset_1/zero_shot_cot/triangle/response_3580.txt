Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph and list all the unique triangles, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's identify all the triangles by looking at all possible triangles formed by each node.

2. Next, we will check if each identified triangle actually exists in the given graph based on the provided edges.

Here are the triangles formed in the given graph:

- <1, 2, 7>
- <1, 7, 5>
- <1, 7, 9>

There are **[3]** triangles in total in this graph.
