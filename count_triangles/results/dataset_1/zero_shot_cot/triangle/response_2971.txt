Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph.

The triangles are formed by nodes that are connected to each other. Let's list them out:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <3, 6, 9>
4. <6, 7, 8>
5. <6, 7, 9>
6. <6, 8, 9>
7. <7, 8, 9>
8. <9, 4, 5>
9. <9, 3, 4>
10. <9, 3, 5>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.
There are 10 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
