Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

We can see that there are a total of 6 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<1, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
