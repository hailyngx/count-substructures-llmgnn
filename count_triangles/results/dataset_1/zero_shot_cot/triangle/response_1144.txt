Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 2.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7.

Now, we identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle 3: <2, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
