Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes. Let's proceed step by step:

1. Nodes with connections:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 4, 5, 7

2. Possible triangles to consider:
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <5, 7, 9>

3. Counting the triangles:
- Total number of triangles is [8]. 

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 8.
