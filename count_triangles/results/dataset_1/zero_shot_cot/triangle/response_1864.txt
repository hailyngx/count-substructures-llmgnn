Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here is a step-by-step process:

1. Analyze each node:
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9.
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
   - Node 2: Connected to nodes 7 and 8.
   - Node 3: Connected to node 7.
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 7 and 9.
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 0 and 1.
   - Node 6: Connected to nodes 7 and 8.
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9.
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 9.
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, 8.

2. Count the triangles:
   - <0, 5, 1>
   - <0, 5, 9>
   - <0, 8, 1>
   - <0, 8, 9>
   - <5, 1, 8>
   - <7, 4, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
