Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Possible triangles involving node 0:  
   - Triangle with nodes (0, 3, 5)
   - Triangle with nodes (0, 3, 9)

2. Possible triangles involving node 2:  
   - Triangle with nodes (2, 3, 8)

3. Possible triangles involving node 3:  
   - Triangle with nodes (3, 4, 6)
   - Triangle with nodes (3, 6, 8)

4. Possible triangles involving node 4:  
   - Triangle with nodes (4, 5, 6)
   - Triangle with nodes (4, 6, 8)

5. Possible triangles involving node 5:  
   - Triangle with nodes (5, 6, 8)

6. Possible triangles involving node 6:  
   - Triangle with nodes (6, 8, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 3, 9>  
<2, 3, 8>  
<3, 4, 6>  
<3, 6, 8>  
<4, 5, 6>  
<4, 6, 8>  
<5, 6, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
