Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a triangle.

Let's start by listing all the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 3, 8>
4. <0, 4, 5>
5. <0, 4, 8>
6. <1, 3, 9>
7. <2, 3, 6>
8. <2, 3, 9>
9. <3, 4, 7>
10. <3, 4, 8>
11. <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
