Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, first, we need to identify all possible triangles by examining each set of three nodes and checking if there is an edge between every pair of them.

Here are the triangles in this graph:

1. <2, 4, 7>
2. <2, 4, 5>
3. <4, 5, 7>

Thus, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
