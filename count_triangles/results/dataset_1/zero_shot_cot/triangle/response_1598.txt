Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. We can count the triangles methodically.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 5. There is no triangle involving Node 0.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6. The triangle <0, 1, 6> is formed.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 7. There is no triangle involving Node 2.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8. The triangles formed are <1, 3, 2> and <1, 3, 8>.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 3. There is no triangle involving Node 4.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 8. There is no triangle involving Node 5.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 1. There is no triangle involving Node 6.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9. There is no triangle involving Node 7.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9. The triangles formed are <1, 8, 3>, <1, 8, 9>, and <3, 8, 9>.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 7 and 8. There is no triangle involving Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, and <3, 8, 9>.
