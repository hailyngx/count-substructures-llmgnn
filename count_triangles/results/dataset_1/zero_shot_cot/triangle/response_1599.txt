Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles first:
1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <0, 5, 6>
5. <1, 2, 5>
6. <2, 3, 5>
7. <3, 4, 5>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles [7] in this graph.
