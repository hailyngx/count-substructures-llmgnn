Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 2.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 0.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle 2: <0, 6, 1>
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 8>
- Triangle 4: <1, 6, 8>
- Triangle 5: <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle 6: <1, 5, 9>
- Triangle 7: <5, 8, 6>
- Triangle 8: <5, 6, 9>
- Triangle 9: <2, 6, 1>
- Triangle 10: <2, 6, 0>
- Triangle 11: <6, 8, 4>
- Triangle 12: <6, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
