Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
In order to count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible combinations of three nodes that form triangles.

Let's list down the triangles present in the graph:
1. <1, 4, 6>
2. <1, 4, 8>
3. <1, 4, 9>
4. <2, 4, 6>
5. <1, 6, 9>
6. <1, 4, 2>
7. <1, 4, 3>
8. <2, 4, 7>
9. <3, 4, 8>
10. <6, 5, 2>
11. <6, 5, 1>
12. <7, 2, 9>
13. <9, 7, 1>

Total number of triangles: [13]
