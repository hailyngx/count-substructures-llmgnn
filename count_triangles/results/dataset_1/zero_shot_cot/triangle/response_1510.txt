Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of (9 choose 3) = 84 possible triangles in this graph. However, not all of these triangles are present in the given graph.
    
The triangles present in the given graph are:
<3, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 5>
<3, 8, 4>, <3, 8, 5>
<4, 7, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
