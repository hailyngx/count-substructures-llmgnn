Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

To find a triangle in a graph, we look for a set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles present in the given graph:

1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <1, 5, 9>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <2, 3, 9>
7. <3, 4, 7>
8. <3, 4, 6>
9. <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
