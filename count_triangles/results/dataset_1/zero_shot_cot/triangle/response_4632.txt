Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify them by looking for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9, forming a triangle <0, 5, 9>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8, forming a triangle <1, 3, 8>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 5, but it does not form a triangle with these connections since node 3 is not connected to node 5 in the opposite direction.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 2, but it does not form a triangle with these connections since node 1 and 2 are not connected directly.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 7, forming a triangle <4, 6, 7>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8, forming triangles <0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, and <5, 8, 1>.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 7, forming a triangle <4, 6, 7>.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 6, forming a triangle <4, 6, 7>.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9, forming a triangle <1, 5, 8>.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 8, forming a triangle <0, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
