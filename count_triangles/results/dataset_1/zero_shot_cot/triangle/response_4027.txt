Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step by step.

Step 1: We have 10 nodes, and the triangles are formed by 3 edges connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles based on the given edges:
- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 6)
- Triangle 2: (0, 3, 2)
- Triangle 3: (0, 4, 5)
- Triangle 4: (2, 8, 3)
- Triangle 5: (2, 8, 4)
- Triangle 6: (2, 9, 6)

Step 2: Let's count the total number of unique triangles found:
- Total number of triangles: 6

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 4, 5>, <2, 8, 3>, <2, 8, 4>, and <2, 9, 6>.
