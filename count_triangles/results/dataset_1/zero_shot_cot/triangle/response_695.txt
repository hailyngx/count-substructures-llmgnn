Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each set of three nodes and see if there is an edge between each pair. Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Look at each triplet of nodes:
   - (0, 2, 5)
   - (0, 2, 8)
   - (0, 2, 9)
   - (0, 5, 8)
   - (0, 5, 9)
   - (0, 8, 9)
   - (2, 5, 8)
   - (2, 5, 9)
   - (2, 8, 9)
   - (5, 8, 9)

2. Identify the triangles (triangles are complete when there is an edge between each pair of the three nodes):
   - Triangle: <0, 2, 5>
   - Triangle: <0, 2, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
