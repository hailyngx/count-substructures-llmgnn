Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. Here are the triangles:
<0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 9, 6>
So, the total number of triangles is [3].
