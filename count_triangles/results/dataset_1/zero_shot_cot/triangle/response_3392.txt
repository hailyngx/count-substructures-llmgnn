Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the graph by checking every combination of 3 nodes:

1. (0, 2, 4)
2. (0, 2, 5)
3. (0, 2, 6)
4. (0, 4, 5)
5. (0, 5, 6)
6. (1, 2, 4)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [6]
