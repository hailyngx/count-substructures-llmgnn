Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <1, 3, 9>
3. <2, 3, 5>
4. <3, 4, 5>
5. <3, 5, 7>
6. <3, 6, 9>
7. <4, 5, 6>
8. <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
