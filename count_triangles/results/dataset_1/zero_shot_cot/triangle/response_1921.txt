Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by three connected nodes.

Let's list out all the triangles first:

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <0, 6, 9>
5. <0, 7, 9>
6. <1, 4, 3>
7. <1, 4, 6>
8. <1, 4, 9>
9. <1, 6, 7>
10. <1, 6, 9>
11. <3, 4, 9>
12. <6, 7, 9>
13. <9, 8, 3>
14. <9, 8, 6>
15. <9, 8, 7>

Count of triangles: [15]
