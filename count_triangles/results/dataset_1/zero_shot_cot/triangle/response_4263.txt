Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, 9. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 8. So, the triangle <0, 4, 7> exists.

2. Node 1 is connected to node 9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, no triangle involving nodes 1 and 9 is formed.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 7. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 9. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 8. So, the triangle <2, 5, 7> exists.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 9. Node 4, 6, and 9 are already part of a triangle as mentioned above.

5. Node 8 is connected to node 7. Node 7 is already part of a triangle involving nodes 0, 4, and 7. So, no new triangle is formed involving node 8.

Based on the connections, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7> and <2, 5, 7>.
