Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can count the triangles by identifying sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 
Let's list the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 2, 6)
2. Triangle 2: (2, 4, 6)
3. Triangle 3: (4, 5, 6)
4. Triangle 4: (2, 8, 4)
5. Triangle 5: (2, 5, 6)
6. Triangle 6: (5, 7, 8)

Total number of triangles: [6] 
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <2, 8, 4>, <2, 5, 6>, <5, 7, 8>.
