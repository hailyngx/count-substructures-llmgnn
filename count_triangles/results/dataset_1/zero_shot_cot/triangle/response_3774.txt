Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

Node 0: [1, 3, 8]
Node 1: [0, 7, 8]
Node 2: [4, 7]
Node 3: [0, 4, 5, 9]
Node 4: [2, 3]
Node 5: [3, 8, 9]
Node 7: [1, 2]
Node 8: [0, 1, 5]
Node 9: [3, 5]

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are mutually connected. Let's check for each possible triangle:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
4. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <1, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 4, 7>
7. Triangle <3, 5, 9>

After checking all possibilities, we found 7 triangles in total. Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
