Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the method for counting triangles, we will look for nodes that form triangles. We will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

Let's denote the nodes as follows:
0 -> A
1 -> B
2 -> C
3 -> D
4 -> E
5 -> F
6 -> G
7 -> H
8 -> I
9 -> J

The triangles present in the graph are as follows:
1. <A, C, E>
2. <A, C, H>
3. <A, E, F>
4. <A, E, H>
5. <B, C, H>
6. <C, D, E>
7. <C, D, H>
8. <C, H, I>
9. <C, H, J>
10. <D, E, H>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
