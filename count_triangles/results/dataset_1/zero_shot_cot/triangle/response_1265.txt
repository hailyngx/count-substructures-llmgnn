Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the steps we can follow:

1. Look at each node and its neighbors to see if there are any triangles.
2. Count the total number of triangles found.

Based on the provided edges, we can see that there are 4 triangles in this graph. The triangles are formed by the following node sets:
<1, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, and <6, 9, 2>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
