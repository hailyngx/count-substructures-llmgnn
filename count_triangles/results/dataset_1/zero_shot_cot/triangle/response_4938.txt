Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all triangles by checking each set of 3 nodes if they form a triangle.
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 3: <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle 4: <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle 5: <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle 6: <1, 6, 7>
- Triangle 7: <1, 6, 8>
- Triangle 8: <1, 7, 8>
- Triangle 9: <1, 8, 9>
- Triangle 10: <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle 11: <2, 5, 6>
- Triangle 12: <6, 7, 8>
- Triangle 13: <0, 2, 5>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.
- Total number of triangles found: [13]
