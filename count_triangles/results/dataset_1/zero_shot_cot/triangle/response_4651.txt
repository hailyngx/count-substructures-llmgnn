Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.

Let's find the triangles:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <5, 8, 9>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
