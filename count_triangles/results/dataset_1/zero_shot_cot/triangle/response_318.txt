Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will identify the triangles in the graph by checking all possible combinations of three nodes. A triangle consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Let's identify the triangles:
1. (0, 1, 2)
2. (0, 1, 5)
3. (0, 1, 8)
4. (0, 2, 5)
5. (1, 2, 0)
6. (1, 2, 8)
7. (1, 3, 8)
8. (1, 5, 0)
9. (3, 4, 8)
10. (3, 8, 6)

Now, counting the total number of triangles, we have: [10] triangles in total.
