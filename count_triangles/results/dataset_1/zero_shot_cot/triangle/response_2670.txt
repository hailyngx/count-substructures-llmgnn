Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's determine the total number of triangles in the given graph by examining each possible triangle formed by the nodes.

1. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
