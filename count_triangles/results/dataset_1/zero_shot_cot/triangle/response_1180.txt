Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here's how we can approach this step-by-step:

1. Identify all the triangles formed by the given edges:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 9)
   - Triangle 2: (2, 1, 9)
   - Triangle 3: (2, 5, 9)
   - Triangle 4: (4, 5, 9)

2. Calculate the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

Therefore, the answer is [4]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 1, 9>, <2, 1, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, and <4, 5, 9>.
