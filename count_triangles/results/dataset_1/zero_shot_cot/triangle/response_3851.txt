Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 7 [<1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>].
