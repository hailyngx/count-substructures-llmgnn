Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify all triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular manner.

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles.

Given the edges provided, we can look for triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
5. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <5, 8, 4>
7. Triangle <5, 8, 7>

So, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
