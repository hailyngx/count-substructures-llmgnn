Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles present in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. 

Let's start by listing all the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 3>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
7. Triangle <2, 6, 4>
8. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
9. Triangle <2, 7, 5>
10. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
11. Triangle <3, 7, 8>
12. Triangle <6, 4, 9>
13. Triangle <6, 9, 2>
14. Triangle <7, 5, 1>
15. Triangle <7, 5, 3>
16. Triangle <8, 1, 3>
17. Triangle <8, 1, 5>
18. Triangle <8, 3, 7>
19. Triangle <8, 9, 2>
20. Triangle <9, 6, 2>
21. Triangle <9, 6, 4>
22. Triangle <9, 6, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [22].
