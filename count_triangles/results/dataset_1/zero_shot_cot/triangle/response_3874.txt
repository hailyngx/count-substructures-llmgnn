Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other, completing a cycle.

Let's list down the unique triangles:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <2, 8, 9>
6. <4, 6, 8>
7. <5, 6, 8>
8. <5, 6, 9>
9. <8, 9, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
