Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's find the triangles step by step:

1. Looking at the edges, we can see that node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
6. Node 6 is connected to node 4.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <2, 7, 9>
- <2, 8, 9>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <7, 9, 8>

Counting the unique triangles, we have found a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
