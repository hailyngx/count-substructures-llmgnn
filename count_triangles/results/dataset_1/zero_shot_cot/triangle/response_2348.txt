Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find all the triangles:

1. Starting with node 0: The neighbors of node 0 are 3, 5, 7, and 8. 
   - Triangle detected: <0, 3, 5>
   - Triangle detected: <0, 3, 7>
   - Triangle detected: <0, 5, 7>
   - Triangle detected: <0, 7, 8>

2. Moving to node 1: The neighbors of node 1 are 2, 4, and 8.
   - Triangle detected: <1, 2, 4>
   - Triangle detected: <1, 4, 8>

3. Checking node 2: The neighbors of node 2 are 1 and 4.
   - No additional triangles found involving node 2.

4. Examining node 3: The neighbors of node 3 are 0, 6, and 7.
   - Triangle detected: <0, 3, 7>

5. Looking at node 4: The neighbors of node 4 are 1, 2, 7, and 9.
   - Triangle detected: <1, 2, 4>
   - Triangle detected: <1, 4, 7>

6. Analyzing node 5: The neighbors of node 5 are 0 and 7.
   - No additional triangles found involving node 5.

7. Checking node 6: The neighbor of node 6 is 3.
   - No triangles are formed with node 6.

8. Analyzing node 7: The neighbors of node 7 are 0, 3, 4, and 5.
   - Triangle detected: <0, 3, 7>
   - Triangle detected: <0, 5, 7>
   - Triangle detected: <1, 4, 7>

9. Looking at node 8: The neighbors of node 8 are 0, 1, and 9.
   - No additional triangles found involving node 8.

10. Examining node 9: The neighbors of node 9 are 4 and 8.
   - No triangles are formed with node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>.
