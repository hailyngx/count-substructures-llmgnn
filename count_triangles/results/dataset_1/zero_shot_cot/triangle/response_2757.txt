Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Firstly, let's identify the triangles in the given graph by finding all the nodes that are connected to each other.

The triangles found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 5, 2>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
