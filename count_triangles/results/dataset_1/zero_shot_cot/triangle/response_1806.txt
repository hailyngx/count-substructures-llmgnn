Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 2.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <2, 5, 7>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
