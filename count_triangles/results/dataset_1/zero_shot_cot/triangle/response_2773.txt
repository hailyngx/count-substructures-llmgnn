Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
By examining the given graph, I will identify the triangles present based on the edges provided:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 4, 6)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 6, 9)
3. Triangle 3: (2, 6, 7)
4. Triangle 4: (3, 6, 7)
5. Triangle 5: (3, 6, 9)
6. Triangle 6: (4, 6, 9)
7. Triangle 7: (8, 9, 1)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
