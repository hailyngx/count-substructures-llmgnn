Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique combinations of three nodes that are connected to each other. Here are the steps to approach this problem:

1. Identify all the triangles formed by the given edges:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 3, 1)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 3, 8)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 3, 9)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 3, 6)
   - Triangle 5: (1, 2, 6)
   - Triangle 6: (3, 4, 6)
   - Triangle 7: (4, 5, 6)
   
2. Count the total number of unique triangles found: [7]

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
