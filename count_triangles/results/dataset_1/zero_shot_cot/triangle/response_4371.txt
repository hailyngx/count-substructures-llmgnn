Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node  
- Node 0: degree 3  
- Node 1: degree 5  
- Node 2: degree 3  
- Node 3: degree 4  
- Node 4: degree 2  
- Node 5: degree 4  
- Node 6: degree 2  
- Node 7: degree 4  
- Node 8: degree 3  
- Node 9: degree 4  

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles using the triangles formula  
Number of triangles = 1/6 * âˆ‘(degree of node i * (degree of node i - 1) * (degree of node i - 2)), for all nodes i that are connected  

Calculating this out:  
Number of triangles = 1/6 * [(3 * 2 * 4) + (5 * 4 * 3) + (3 * 2 * 4) + (4 * 3 * 2) + (2 * 4 * 2) + (4 * 3 * 4) + (2 * 3 * 4) + (4 * 3 * 4) + (3 * 2 * 3) + (4 * 3 * 3)]  
Number of triangles = 1/6 * [24 + 60 + 24 + 24 + 16 + 48 + 24 + 48 + 18 + 36]  
Number of triangles = 1/6 * 302 = 50.33  

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [50].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 1, 5>  
<0, 2, 7>  
<1, 2, 3>  
<1, 2, 8>  
<1, 5, 9>  
<2, 3, 7>  
<4, 7, 9>
