Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles step by step:
1. Nodes 1, 3, and 6 form a triangle: <1, 3, 6>.
2. Nodes 1, 6, and 4 form a triangle: <1, 6, 4>.
3. Nodes 1, 6, and 5 form a triangle: <1, 6, 5>.
4. Nodes 6, 4, and 5 form a triangle: <6, 4, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
