Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To identify the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

From the given graph, the triangles are as follows:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 4>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
