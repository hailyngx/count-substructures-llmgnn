Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 4, forming a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3, forming a triangle <1, 2, 3>.
3. Node 1 is connected to nodes 7 and 8, forming a triangle <1, 7, 8>.
4. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3, forming a triangle <1, 2, 3>.
5. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 8, forming a triangle <3, 6, 8>.
6. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 7, forming a triangle <4, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
