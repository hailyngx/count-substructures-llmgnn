Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles that can be formed by connecting three nodes. Specifically, we will check all combinations of three nodes and see if there is an edge between each pair of nodes.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 4>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 7, 3>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 8, 0>
<1, 8, 3>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 3>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 3>
<5, 7, 9>

Hence, there are a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.
