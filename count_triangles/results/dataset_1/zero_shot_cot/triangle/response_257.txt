Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify triangles by looking for nodes that have mutual connections. Here are the steps to find the triangles:

1. There are three nodes in a triangle, so we will look for nodes that have connections amongst each other.
2. We will identify all possible triangles based on the given edges.
3. We will then count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's find the triangles step by step:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4) form a triangle involving node 0.
   - (0, 2), (0, 6), (2, 6) form a triangle involving node 0.

2. Triangles involving node 1:
   - (1, 4), (1, 8), (4, 8) form a triangle involving node 1.

3. Triangles involving node 2:
   - (2, 0), (2, 4), (0, 4) form a triangle involving node 2.

4. Triangles involving node 3:
   - (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 6) form a triangle involving node 3.

5. Triangles involving node 4:
   - Already counted in previous calculations.

6. Triangles involving node 5:
   - Already counted.

7. Triangles involving node 6:
   - Already counted.

8. Triangles involving node 7:
   - Already counted.

9. Triangles involving node 8:
   - (8, 1), (8, 4), (1, 4) form a triangle involving node 8.

10. Triangles involving node 9:
    - (9, 5), (9, 8), (5, 8) form a triangle involving node 9.

Unique Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <9, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
