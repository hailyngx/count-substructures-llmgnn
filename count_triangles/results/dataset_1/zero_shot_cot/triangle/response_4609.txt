Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the graph by checking all possible combinations of three nodes which are connected to each other.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles found: [4]
