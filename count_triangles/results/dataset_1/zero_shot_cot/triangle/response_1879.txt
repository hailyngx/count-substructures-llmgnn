Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Nodes directly connected to each other:
   - <0, 6, 7>
   - <0, 6, 8>
   - <0, 7, 4>
   - <0, 7, 6>
   - <0, 8, 5>
   - <1, 2, 8>
   - <2, 1, 8>
   - <2, 1, 8>
   - <4, 7, 5>
   - <4, 7, 6>
   - <4, 8, 5>
   - <7, 4, 5>
   - <8, 0, 6>
   - <8, 1, 2>
   - <8, 2, 9>
   - <8, 3, 6>
   - <8, 3, 4>
   - <8, 4, 5>
   - <9, 2, 4>

2. Triangles formed by nodes 0 and 6:
   - <0, 6, 7>
   - <0, 6, 8>

3. Triangles formed by nodes 0 and 7:
   - <0, 7, 4>
   - <0, 7, 6>

4. Triangles formed by nodes 0 and 8:
   - <0, 8, 5>

5. Triangles formed by nodes 2 and 8:
   - <1, 2, 8>
   - <2, 1, 8>

6. Triangles formed by nodes 4 and 7:
   - <4, 7, 5>
   - <4, 7, 6>

7. Triangles formed by nodes 4 and 8:
   - <4, 8, 5>

8. Triangles formed by nodes 7 and 8:
   - <7, 4, 5>

9. Triangles formed by nodes 2 and 9:
   - <8, 2, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
