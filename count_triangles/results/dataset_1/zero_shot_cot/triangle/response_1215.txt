Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.

Given the edges provided, we can visualize the graph as follows:

```
    0 -- 2
   /|    |
  4 |    |
   \|    |
    7 -- 5 -- 8
        /|\
       9 6 
```

From the graph above, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <2, 4, 5>
5. <5, 7, 9>
6. <5, 8, 6>
7. <6, 8, 9>
8. <7, 9, 4>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in total. So, the output is:
[8]
