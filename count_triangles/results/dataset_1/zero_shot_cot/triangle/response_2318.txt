Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other in a triangular manner.

Identifying all triangles:
1. <1, 2, 3>
2. <1, 4, 5>
3. <1, 7, 8>
4. <7, 8, 9>

Count of triangles: [4]
