Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify each node's neighbors based on the given edges.
2. For each edge (i, j), check if there is a common neighbor k for i and j (i.e., edges (i, k) and (j, k) exist).
3. Count the number of triangles formed by these three nodes (i, j, k).

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<2, 1, 3>
[Total number of triangles: 3]
