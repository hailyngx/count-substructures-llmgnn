Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph.

A triangle in a graph is formed by three nodes connected by edges. To find the number of triangles, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's list the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 4, 3>
2. <1, 7, 6>
3. <1, 7, 9>
4. <3, 8, 9>
5. <3, 4, 6>
6. <0, 8, 1>
7. <7, 6, 4>
8. <7, 5, 1>
9. <3, 2, 4>
10. <3, 8, 0>
11. <3, 9, 1>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
