Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

To find a triangle, we need to look for three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Given the edges in the graph, the triangles that can be formed are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <2, 5, 7>
5. <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
