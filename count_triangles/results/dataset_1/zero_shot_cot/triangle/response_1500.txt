Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. A triangle consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the set.

Let's list down the unique triangles present in the graph:
1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <1, 5, 6>
5. <1, 5, 9>
6. <2, 3, 5>
7. <4, 5, 6>
8. <5, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
