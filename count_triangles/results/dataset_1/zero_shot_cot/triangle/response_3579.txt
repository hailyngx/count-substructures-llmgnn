Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, one approach is to look for all possible triangles formed by each set of three nodes. Let's list out the unique triangles found in the provided graph.

Here are the unique triangles in the given graph:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 5>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Counting the total number of triangles: [8]
