Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify the triangles in the graph.
- Triangle: A set of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.
- Look for sets of three nodes that form triangles.

Step 2: List the unique triangles found.
- <0, 1, 3>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <6, 8, 1>
- <7, 8, 9>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles.
- Total number of triangles: 7

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
