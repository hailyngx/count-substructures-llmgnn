Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
5. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
6. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
7. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
8. Triangle <3, 7, 9>
9. Triangle <5, 7, 9>
10. Triangle <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total. So, the output will be [10].
