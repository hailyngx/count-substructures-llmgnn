Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. 

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <1, 6, 8>
2. <1, 6, 9>
3. <1, 7, 9>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <2, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
