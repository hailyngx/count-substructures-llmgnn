Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's examine each possible triangle combination:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
4. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
6. Triangle <3, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
