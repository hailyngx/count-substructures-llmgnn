Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
I will start by listing all the triangles that exist in the graph.

Triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <0, 1, 9>
4. <0, 2, 5>
5. <1, 2, 5>
6. <1, 2, 6>
7. <1, 5, 6>
8. <2, 5, 6>
9. <2, 5, 7>
10. <3, 4, 8>
11. <5, 7, 3>
12. <6, 9, 0>
13. <6, 9, 1>

Total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
