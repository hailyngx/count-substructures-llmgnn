Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles I found in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <2, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
