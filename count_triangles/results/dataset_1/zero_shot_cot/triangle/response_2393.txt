Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph provided, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to node 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle 2: <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle 3: <3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
