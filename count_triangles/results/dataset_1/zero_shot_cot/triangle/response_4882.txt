Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to examine each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the triangles:
- <0, 4, 1>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 7, 1>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <4, 7, 0>
- <4, 7, 1>
- <7, 3, 5>
- <8, 1, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
