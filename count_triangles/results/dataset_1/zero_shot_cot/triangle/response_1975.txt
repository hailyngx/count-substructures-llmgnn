Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 3>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, and <1, 2, 8>.
