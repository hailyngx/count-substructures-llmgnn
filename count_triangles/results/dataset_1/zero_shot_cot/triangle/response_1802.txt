Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Start by listing out the triangles formed by checking each possible set of three nodes connected to each other:

    <0, 1, 3>
    <0, 1, 4>
    <1, 3, 2>
    <1, 3, 6>
    <1, 3, 7>
    <1, 4, 8>
    <3, 2, 9>
    <3, 6, 5>
    <3, 6, 8>
    <3, 7, 9>
    <3, 7, 9>
    <4, 8, 6>
    <8, 6, 5>
    <8, 6, 9>
    <8, 4, 1>
    <9, 7, 3>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles listed above: [6]

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.
