Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
1. <0, 5, 4>
2. <0, 5, 1>
3. <0, 8, 2>
4. <0, 8, 9>
5. <2, 3, 6>
6. <2, 3, 4>
7. <2, 4, 5>
8. <8, 0, 9>
9. <8, 0, 5>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
