Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle consists of three nodes connected by edges in such a way that they form a closed loop.

Let's denote each node as follows:
0 = A
1 = B
2 = C
3 = D
4 = E
5 = F
6 = G
7 = H
8 = I

Now, let's list down the triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
