Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] <0, 1, 5> and <1, 3, 7>.
