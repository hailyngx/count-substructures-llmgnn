Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the given graph based on the provided edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 is connected to 2, 6, 7
- 1 is connected to 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- 2 is connected to 0, 1, 4, 9
- 3 is connected to 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- 4 is connected to 2, 5
- 5 is connected to 1, 4, 8, 9
- 6 is connected to 0, 1, 3, 7
- 7 is connected to 0, 3, 6
- 8 is connected to 3, 5, 9
- 9 is connected to 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph and list the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 8, 9>
