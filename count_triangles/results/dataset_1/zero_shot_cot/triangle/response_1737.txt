Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for closed loops of length 3, which represent triangles. Let's go step-by-step through the nodes to identify the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: (1, 5, 8)
2. Nodes connected to node 1: (0, 7, 9)
3. Nodes connected to node 2: (5, 6, 8, 9)
4. Nodes connected to node 3: (4, 7, 8)
5. Nodes connected to node 4: (3, 9)
6. Nodes connected to node 5: (0, 2, 6)
7. Nodes connected to node 6: (2, 5, 7, 9)
8. Nodes connected to node 7: (1, 3, 6)
9. Nodes connected to node 8: (0, 2, 3)
10. Nodes connected to node 9: (1, 2, 4, 6)

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 5, 2>
- <1, 7, 3>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 7, 6>
- <3, 8, 0>
- <6, 7, 1>
- <6, 7, 3>
- <8, 0, 2>
- <8, 0, 3>
- <9, 1, 2>
- <9, 4, 3>
- <9, 6, 2>
- <9, 6, 7>

Counting the unique triangles listed above, we get a total of 18 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
