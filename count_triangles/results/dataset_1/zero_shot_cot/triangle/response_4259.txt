Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the given graph step by step to find all the triangles present:

1. Node 0 is connected to Node 2.
2. Node 1 is connected to Nodes 4, 5, 7, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0 and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to Nodes 4 and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to Nodes 5 and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, and 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to Nodes 2 and 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6.

Now, we will find all the triangles in this graph. A triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other.

The unique triangles in this graph are:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
