Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are interconnected. Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. Nodes with their respective connections:
    - Node 0: Connected to nodes 3 and 6
    - Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 8
    - Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7
    - Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6
    - Node 4: Connected to nodes 3 and 7
    - Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7
    - Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3
    - Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9
    - Node 8: Connected to node 1
    - Node 9: Connected to node 7

2. Let's find the triangles:
    - <1, 2, 3>
    - <1, 3, 5>
    - <1, 5, 7>
    - <2, 3, 7>
    - <3, 5, 7>

3. Counting the total number of triangles: [5]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
