Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph.

Let's list out all possible triangles using the given edges:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - No triangles involving node 0.

2. Triangles involving node 1:
   - <1, 2, 8>

3. Triangles involving node 2:
   - <1, 2, 8>
   - <1, 2, 9>
   - <2, 3, 8>

4. Triangles involving node 3:
   - <1, 2, 8>
   - <1, 2, 9>
   - <2, 3, 8>

5. Triangles involving node 4:
   - No triangles involving node 4.

6. Triangles involving node 5:
   - No triangles involving node 5.

7. Triangles involving node 6:
   - No triangles involving node 6.

8. Triangles involving node 7:
   - No triangles involving node 7.

9. Triangles involving node 8:
   - <1, 2, 8>
   - <1, 2, 9>
   - <2, 3, 8>

10. Triangles involving node 9:
    - <1, 2, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles.
- Total number of unique triangles in the graph: [4]
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, and <1, 2, 9>.
