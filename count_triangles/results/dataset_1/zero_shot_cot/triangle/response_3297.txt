Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
I will count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes.

The possible triangles are:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <0, 4, 7>
5. <0, 6, 8>
6. <0, 7, 8>
7. <0, 7, 9>
8. <1, 3, 4>
9. <1, 3, 7>
10. <1, 4, 7>

There are total of [10] triangles in this graph.
