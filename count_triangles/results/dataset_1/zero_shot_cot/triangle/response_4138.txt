Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list all the triangles that we can find in this graph:
1. <1, 5, 7>
2. <3, 2, 8>
3. <5, 6, 8>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
