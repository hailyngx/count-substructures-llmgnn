Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here are the triangles (cycles of length 3) found in the given graph:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 1, 8>
4. <1, 2, 8>

There are [4] triangles in total in this graph.
