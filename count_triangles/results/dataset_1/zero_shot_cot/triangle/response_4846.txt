Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2

Step 2: Count the number of triangles.
- For every node, check if there is a triangle starting from that node.
- Calculate the number of triangles each node is involved in and account for potential overlapping triangles.

Node 0: 0 triangles
Node 1: 1 triangle (<1, 0, 5>)
Node 2: 1 triangle (<2, 5, 4>)
Node 3: 0 triangles
Node 4: 3 triangles (<4, 2, 5>, <4, 3, 5>, <4, 8, 5>)
Node 5: 1 triangle (already counted with Node 2)
Node 6: 0 triangles
Node 7: 1 triangle (<7, 2, 8>)
Node 8: 2 triangles (<8, 4, 2>, <8, 9, 4>)
Node 9: 0 triangles

Step 3: Sum up the total number of triangles.
Total number of triangles: [8]
