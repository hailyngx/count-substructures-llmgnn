Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<1, 0, 2>
<1, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [4].
