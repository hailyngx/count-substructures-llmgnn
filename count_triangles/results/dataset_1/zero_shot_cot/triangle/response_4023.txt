Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph, the triangles formed are as follows:

1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <1, 2, 3>
3. <1, 6, 8>
4. <2, 5, 9>
5. <2, 6, 9>
6. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
