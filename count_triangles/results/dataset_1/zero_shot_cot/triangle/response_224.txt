Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the unique triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle: <1, 4, 3>
2. Triangle: <1, 5, 3>
3. Triangle: <1, 5, 8>
4. Triangle: <3, 4, 5>
5. Triangle: <8, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
