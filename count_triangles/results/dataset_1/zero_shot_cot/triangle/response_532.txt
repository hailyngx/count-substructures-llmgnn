Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's find the total number of triangles present in the graph:

1. For any triangle in a graph, it must consist of 3 nodes connected in a cyclic manner.
2. To count the number of triangles, we need to check each set of 3 nodes and see if they form a triangle.

Let's identify the triangles in the graph:

- Triangles: <1, 3, 2>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 5>, <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
