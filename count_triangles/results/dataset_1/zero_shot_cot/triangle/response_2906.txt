Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all combinations of 3 nodes that are connected to each other. Let's work through this step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 3 and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <1, 2, 7>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <2, 8, 9>
6. <3, 4, 8>
7. <6, 7, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
