Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each possible triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges.

Let's evaluate the possible triangles:
1. Triangle involving node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 7), (0, 4, 8)
2. Triangle involving node 1: (1, 0, 4), (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 9)
3. Triangle involving node 2: (2, 0, 4), (2, 4, 9)
4. Triangle involving node 3: (3, 0, 7)
5. Triangle involving node 4: (4, 1, 9)
6. Triangle involving node 7: (7, 3, 4), (7, 4, 5), (7, 4, 6), (7, 5, 6)

Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles:
- There are 6 unique triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, and <1, 4, 9>.
