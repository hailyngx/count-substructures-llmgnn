Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Look for nodes that form triangles, which means they are all connected to each other.

By examining the edges provided, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Counting the unique triangles gives us a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
