Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all possible triangles formed by the given edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other through edges. Let's identify the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Checking all possible triangles involving each node:
   - For node 0: (0, 3, 5)
   - For node 1: (1, 3, 6), (1, 6, 9)
   - For node 2: (2, 5, 6)
   - For node 3: No additional triangles
   - For node 4: No additional triangles
   - For node 5: (0, 2, 5), (5, 4, 8)
   - For node 6: (1, 2, 6)
   - For node 7: No additional triangles
   - For node 8: (3, 4, 8), (5, 6, 8)
   - For node 9: No additional triangles

2. Counting the total number of triangles:
   - <0, 3, 5>
   - <0, 2, 5>
   - <1, 3, 6>
   - <1, 6, 9>
   - <2, 5, 6>
   - <3, 4, 8>
   - <5, 4, 8>
   - <5, 6, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 8]
