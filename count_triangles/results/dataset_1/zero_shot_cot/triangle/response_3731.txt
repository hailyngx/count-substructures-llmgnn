Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges.
Let's list the triangles present in this graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 4, 5>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <2, 5, 9>
6. <4, 5, 9>
7. <5, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
