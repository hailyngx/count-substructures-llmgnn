Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all sets of 3 nodes that are mutually connected to each other.

Let's list all the triangles found in this graph step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <2, 5, 3>
3. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
5. Triangle <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
