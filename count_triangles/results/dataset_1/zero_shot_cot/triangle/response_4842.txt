Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to Node 1: 5, 6, 9
2. Nodes connected to Node 2: 5
3. Nodes connected to Node 3: 4, 6, 8
4. Nodes connected to Node 4: 3
5. Nodes connected to Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
6. Nodes connected to Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 7
7. Nodes connected to Node 7: 5, 6
8. Nodes connected to Node 8: 3
9. Nodes connected to Node 9: 1, 5

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: Nodes 1, 5, 6
- Triangle 2: Nodes 5, 6, 7

Hence, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph: <1, 5, 6> and <5, 6, 7>.
