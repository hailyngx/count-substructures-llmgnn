Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify how many triangles are in the given graph.

- Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle <1, 6, 8>
- Triangle <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
