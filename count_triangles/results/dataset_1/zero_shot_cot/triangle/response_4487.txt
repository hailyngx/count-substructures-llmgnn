Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining all possible triangles formed by the nodes in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles are:
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<0, 1, 9>
