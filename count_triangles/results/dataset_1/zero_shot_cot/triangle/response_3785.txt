Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we follow these steps:

1. Look for every set of three nodes that form a triangle.
2. Check if there is an edge between all three pairs of nodes in the set.

Let's calculate the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles: <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <3, 2, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <7, 6, 9>
