Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <2, 4, 6>
5. <2, 4, 9>
6. <3, 4, 5>
7. <3, 4, 6>
8. <3, 4, 8>
9. <3, 5, 7>
10. <3, 5, 4>
11. <3, 5, 6>

The total number of triangles in this graph is [11].
