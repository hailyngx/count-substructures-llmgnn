Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Based on the given graph, let's write down all the triangles:

- Triangle 1: (0, 8, 3)
- Triangle 2: (0, 8, 6)
- Triangle 3: (0, 9, 4)
- Triangle 4: (0, 9, 5)
- Triangle 5: (1, 2, 6)
- Triangle 6: (1, 3, 6)
- Triangle 7: (1, 6, 2)
- Triangle 8: (1, 6, 3)
- Triangle 9: (1, 6, 8)
- Triangle 10: (1, 7, 1)
- Triangle 11: (1, 7, 6)
- Triangle 12: (1, 7, 2)
- Triangle 13: (1, 4, 9)
- Triangle 14: (1, 4, 5)
- Triangle 15: (1, 4, 0)
- Triangle 16: (1, 4, 1)
- Triangle 17: (2, 6, 1)
- Triangle 18: (3, 1, 6)
- Triangle 19: (3, 6, 1)
- Triangle 20: (3, 6, 8)
- Triangle 21: (3, 8, 0)
- Triangle 22: (3, 8, 6)
- Triangle 23: (4, 5, 9)
- Triangle 24: (4, 5, 0)
- Triangle 25: (4, 1, 9)
- Triangle 26: (4, 1, 0)
- Triangle 27: (5, 9, 0)
- Triangle 28: (6, 2, 1)
- Triangle 29: (6, 3, 1)
- Triangle 30: (6, 3, 8)
- Triangle 31: (6, 8, 0)
- Triangle 32: (7, 1, 6)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles:
