Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles by checking all possible sets of 3 nodes:

1. (0, 3, 5)
2. (0, 3, 7)
3. (0, 5, 7)
4. (2, 5, 9)
5. (4, 1, 6)
6. (0, 7, 6)

Now, counting the total number of triangles, we find that there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
