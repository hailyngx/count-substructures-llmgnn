Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by listing all the unique triangles:

1. <1, 3, 5>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <2, 3, 6>
5. <2, 3, 9>
6. <2, 6, 7>
7. <3, 5, 9>
8. <3, 6, 8>
9. <4, 6, 7>
10. <5, 7, 9>
11. <6, 2, 4>
12. <6, 3, 8>
13. <6, 4, 8>
14. <7, 4, 5>
15. <7, 5, 9>
16. <9, 1, 5>
17. <9, 2, 3>
18. <9, 2, 5>
19. <9, 2, 7>
20. <9, 5, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [20] triangles in the given graph.
