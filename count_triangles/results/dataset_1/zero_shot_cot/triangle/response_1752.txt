Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Initially, let's identify the triangles in the graph to count the total number of triangles.

Starting from node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9.
- There is a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
- There is a triangle <0, 1, 7>.
- There is a triangle <0, 1, 9>.

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8.
- There is a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
- There is a triangle <0, 1, 8>.

Taking other nodes into account as well, we find the following unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
