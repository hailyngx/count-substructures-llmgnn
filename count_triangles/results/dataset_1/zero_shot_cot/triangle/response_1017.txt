Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
3. Triangle <3, 1, 5>
4. Triangle <4, 1, 5>
5. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
6. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
7. Triangle <5, 6, 0>
8. Triangle <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
