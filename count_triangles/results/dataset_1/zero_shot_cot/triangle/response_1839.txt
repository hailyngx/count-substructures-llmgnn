Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify triangles by finding nodes that are connected to each other in a triangular manner. A triangle consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Let's go step-by-step to find the number of triangles and list the unique triangles:
1. Identify the nodes and their connections:
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 2 and 3
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9
   - Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9
   - Node 3: Connected to node 0
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 1 and 6
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 2 and 7
   - Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 5 and 8
   - Node 8: Connected to node 7
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 1 and 2

2. Identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 6>
   - Triangle 2: <1, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 3: <2, 5, 7>

3. Count the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles [3] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 3, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, and <2, 5, 7>.
