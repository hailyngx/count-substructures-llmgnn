Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each possible triangle formed by three nodes and check if edges exist between each pair of nodes in that triangle.

Let's go through the triangles:
1. Triangle <1, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <1, 8, 4>
3. Triangle <1, 9, 3>
4. Triangle <2, 9, 3>
5. Triangle <4, 8, 6>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
