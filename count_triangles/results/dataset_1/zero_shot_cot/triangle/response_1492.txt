Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the triangles present in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
5. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
6. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
7. Triangle <5, 6, 1>
8. Triangle <5, 6, 4>
9. Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in total in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [9].
