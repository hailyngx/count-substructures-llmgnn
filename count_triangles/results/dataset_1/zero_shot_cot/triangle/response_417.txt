Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 7>.
