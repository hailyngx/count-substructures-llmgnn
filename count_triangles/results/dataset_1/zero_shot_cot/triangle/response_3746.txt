Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more visual way to better understand it:

```
0 -- 1
|    | \
|    |  \
|    |   4
|    |  / |
2    | /  |
 \   |    |
  \  |    |
    7    5
        /| \
       / |  \
      3  |   8
          |  
          6
         / \
        /   \
       9 ---  ---   
```

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:
1. Traverse through each node and calculate the number of triangles it can form.
2. Add up the total number of triangles from all nodes.
3. Since we're looking at simple (non-directed) triangles, each triangle is counted three times, once for each of its vertices. So, divide the total count by 3 to get the number of unique triangles.

The total number of triangles in this graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, and <5, 6, 9>.
