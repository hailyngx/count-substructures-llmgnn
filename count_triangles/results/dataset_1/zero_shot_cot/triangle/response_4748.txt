Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 8.
   - Triangle <0, 4, 8>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
5. Node 5 is connected to node 0.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9.
