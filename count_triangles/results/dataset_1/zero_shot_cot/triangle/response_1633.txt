Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. (0, 1, 8) forms a triangle.
2. (0, 1, 5) forms a triangle.
3. (0, 1, 6) forms a triangle.
4. (0, 5, 6) forms a triangle.
5. (0, 5, 8) forms a triangle.
6. (0, 6, 8) forms a triangle.
7. (1, 3, 8) forms a triangle.
8. (3, 4, 6) forms a triangle.
9. (3, 4, 7) forms a triangle.
10. (3, 7, 9) forms a triangle.

There are a total of \[10\] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, and <3, 7, 9>.
