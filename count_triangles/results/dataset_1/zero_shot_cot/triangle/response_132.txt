Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is  <0, 3, 4>, <0, 6, 9>. Therefore, the number of triangles is [2].
