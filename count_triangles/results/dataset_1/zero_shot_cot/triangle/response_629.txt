Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 5, 1>
2. <0, 5, 2>
3. <0, 6, 1>
4. <0, 6, 2>
5. <0, 9, 7>
6. <0, 9, 8>
7. <1, 5, 2>
8. <1, 6, 2>
9. <1, 5, 2>
10. <1, 8, 4>
11. <2, 5, 6>
12. <3, 1, 5>
13. <3, 1, 6>
14. <3, 2, 6>
15. <3, 4, 8>
16. <4, 1, 5>
17. <4, 3, 8>
18. <5, 2, 6>
19. <8, 9, 7>
20. <8, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
