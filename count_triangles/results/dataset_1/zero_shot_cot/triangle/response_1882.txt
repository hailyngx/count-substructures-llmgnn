Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the graph:
1. (0, 2, 8)
2. (1, 6, 9)
3. (1, 7, 9)
4. (2, 0, 8)
5. (3, 4, 9)
6. (6, 1, 9)
7. (7, 1, 9)
8. (8, 0, 2)
9. (9, 3, 6)
10. (9, 3, 7)
11. (9, 6, 1)
12. (9, 7, 1)
13. (9, 8, 0)
14. (9, 8, 2)

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
