Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are interconnected by edges forming a triangle.

Upon analyzing the given graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <1, 3, 9>
4. <1, 4, 8>
5. <2, 3, 6>
6. <2, 3, 8>
7. <3, 6, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
