Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

For the given graph with 10 nodes and the 28 edges provided, let's count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 5>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
