Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's determine the total number of triangles formed by these edges.

Explanation:
- A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected in such a way that they create three edges between them.
- To find triangles, we need to look for combinations of three connected nodes in the graph.

Identifying the triangles:
1. Possible triangles:
   - <1, 2, 7>
   - <1, 2, 9>
   - <1, 4, 8>
   - <1, 7, 8>
   - <2, 7, 9>
   - <3, 5, 7>
   - <3, 5, 9>
   - <5, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [7]
