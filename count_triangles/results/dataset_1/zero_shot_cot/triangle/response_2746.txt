Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's determine the total number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3}

Now let's find the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 3, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
