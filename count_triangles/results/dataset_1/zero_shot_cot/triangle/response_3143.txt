Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's count the number of triangles.

Let's check each possible triangle:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 1, 2) -> No, missing edge (1, 2)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 1, 5) -> No, missing edge (1, 5)
3. Triangle 3: (0, 2, 5) -> Yes
4. Triangle 4: (1, 3, 4) -> Yes
5. Triangle 5: (1, 3, 6) -> No, missing edge (3, 6)
6. Triangle 6: (1, 4, 6) -> Yes
7. Triangle 7: (2, 4, 5) -> Yes
8. Triangle 8: (3, 4, 5) -> Yes
9. Triangle 9: (4, 5, 6) -> No, missing edge (5, 6)
10. Triangle 10: (6, 8, 9) -> No, missing edge (6, 8)

So, there are 4 triangles in this graph. Let's list them:

1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 4, 6>
4. <2, 4, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
