Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we examine every set of three nodes and check if each pair of nodes is connected by an edge. If all three pairs are connected, then we have found a triangle.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
[Total number of triangles: 3]
