Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find all the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 2, 3)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 3, 7)
3. Triangle 3: (3, 5, 7)
4. Triangle 4: (4, 5, 6)

There are no more triangles in this graph. So, the total number of triangles in the graph is 4.

Therefore, the answer is [4].
