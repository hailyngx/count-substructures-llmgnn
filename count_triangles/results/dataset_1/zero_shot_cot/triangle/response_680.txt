Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's analyze each node's connections and see if there are any triangles formed:
- Node 0: Connected to node 9
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 9
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 3, 6
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: Connected to node 1
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6

Based on the given connections, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <1, 9, 0>
2. <1, 9, 2>
3. <1, 9, 3>
4. <1, 2, 9>
5. <1, 3, 6>
6. <1, 4, 6>
7. <2, 9, 3>
8. <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in total. So, the output is [8].
