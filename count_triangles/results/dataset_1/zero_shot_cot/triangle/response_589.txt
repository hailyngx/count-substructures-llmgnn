Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
