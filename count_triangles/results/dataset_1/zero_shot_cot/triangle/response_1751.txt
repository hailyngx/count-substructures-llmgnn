Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected. Let's go through each possible triangle step-by-step:

1. Triangle involving node 0:
   - Nodes connected to node 0: 2, 6, 7
   - Possible triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>

2. Triangle involving node 2:
   - Nodes connected to node 2: 0, 1, 8
   - Possible triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 8>

3. Triangle involving node 6:
   - Nodes connected to node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5
   - Possible triangles: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>

4. Triangle involving node 5:
   - Nodes connected to node 5: 6, 8, 9
   - Possible triangles: <6, 8, 5>, <6, 9, 5>, <8, 9, 5>

From the above breakdown, we can see that there are 13 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [13].
