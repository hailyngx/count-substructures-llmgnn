Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles using the number of common neighbors:

- For each edge, check for shared neighbors to form triangles.
- List of triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
