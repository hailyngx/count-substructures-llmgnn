Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the graph by identifying all the sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <1, 2, 5>
4. <1, 3, 5>
5. <2, 4, 5>
6. <3, 4, 5>
7. <5, 6, 8>
8. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
