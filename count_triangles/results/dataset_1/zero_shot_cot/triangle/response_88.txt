Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in a graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by sets of three nodes. Let's list down the unique triangles present in the given graph:

1. <2, 3, 5>
2. <2, 3, 9>
3. <2, 4, 5>
4. <2, 4, 9>
5. <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
