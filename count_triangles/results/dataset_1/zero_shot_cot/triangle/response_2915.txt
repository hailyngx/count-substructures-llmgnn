Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here is how we can approach this problem step by step:
1. Identify triangles: For each node, identify the neighbors of that node and check if there are any triangles that can be formed using that node and its neighbors.
2. Count the triangles: Count the total number of unique triangles that can be formed in the graph.
3. List the unique triangles found.

Let's start by listing the unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 9, 7>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles inside brackets []:
