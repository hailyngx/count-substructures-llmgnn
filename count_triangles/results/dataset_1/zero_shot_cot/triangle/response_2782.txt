Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles by looking at the edges and nodes provided.

Let's list down the unique triangles:
1. <0, 5, 9>
2. <0, 6, 7>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <2, 4, 6>
5. <2, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
