Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the given edges. Let's list the unique triangles found step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 4, 5>
2. Triangle 2: <1, 4, 8>
3. Triangle 3: <3, 7, 5>
4. Triangle 4: <4, 5, 8>
5. Triangle 5: <4, 5, 9>
6. Triangle 6: <5, 7, 8>
7. Triangle 7: <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
