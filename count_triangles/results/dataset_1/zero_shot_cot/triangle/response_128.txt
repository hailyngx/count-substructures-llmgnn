Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
I will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

First, let's list all the triangles that can be found in this graph:
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
