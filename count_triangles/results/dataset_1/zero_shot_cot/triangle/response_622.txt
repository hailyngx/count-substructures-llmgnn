Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node -
Node 0: 2
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 6
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 5
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 4

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles formed in the graph -
Looking at the degrees of each node, we identify that Node 2 has 6 edges, making it the highest-degree node. Since a triangle requires 3 edges to form, we consider the edges originating from Node 2. These are (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7). Checking all combinations of these edges, we find the following triangles:
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 7, 9>
  
Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
