Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Looking at the provided graph, we can see that there are several triangles formed by the connected nodes. Let's list the triangles one by one and then count the total number of triangles.

1. Triangle: <2, 3, 8>
2. Triangle: <2, 4, 7>
3. Triangle: <2, 5, 8>
4. Triangle: <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
