Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. From the given edges, we see that there is a triangle formed by nodes 1, 3, and 8 since:
   - Node 1 is connected to node 3.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
   - Node 8 is connected to node 1.

So, one triangle is <1, 3, 8>.

2. There are no other triangles in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
