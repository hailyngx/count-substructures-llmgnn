Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles present in the graph:
1. (0, 4, 9)
2. (1, 2, 6)
3. (1, 5, 8)
4. (2, 5, 9)
5. (4, 5, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:
There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
