Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify each unique triangle formed by three connected nodes.

From the given edge list, we can see that the possible triangles are:
1. (0, 2, 3)
2. (0, 2, 7)
3. (0, 3, 7)
4. (2, 3, 7)
5. (2, 4, 7)
6. (4, 7, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
