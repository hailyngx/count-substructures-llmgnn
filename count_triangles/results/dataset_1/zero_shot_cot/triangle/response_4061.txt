Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other forming a closed triangle.

By examining the provided edges, we can identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 1>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 8>
5. Triangle <1, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
