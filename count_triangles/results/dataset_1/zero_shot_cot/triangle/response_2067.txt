Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique combinations of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.

Let's list the triangles found:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <1, 4, 5>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <2, 3, 4>
5. <4, 5, 6>
6. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
