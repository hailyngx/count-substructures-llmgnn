Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can use the concept that a triangle exists whenever three nodes are all connected to each other.

Looking at the given edges, we can determine the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <2, 3, 7>
3. <2, 4, 8>
4. <4, 5, 8>
5. <7, 6, 0>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
