Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 9>.
