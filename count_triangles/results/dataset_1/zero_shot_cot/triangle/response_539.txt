Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to node 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8.

Now, let's count the number of triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 0>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
3. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
4. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 3>
6. Triangle <6, 7, 6>
7. Triangle <6, 7, 9>
8. Triangle <6, 9, 8>
9. Triangle <8, 9, 8>

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
