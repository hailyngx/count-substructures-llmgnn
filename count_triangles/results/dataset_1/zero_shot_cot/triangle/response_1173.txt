Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph, we can identify the triangles by checking for nodes that are connected in such a way that they form a triangle shape.

Let's list all the unique triangles in this graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <1, 0, 2>
5. <1, 2, 6>
6. <1, 3, 6>
7. <2, 0, 5>
8. <2, 1, 5>
9. <2, 5, 6>
10. <6, 3, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
