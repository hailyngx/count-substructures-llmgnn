Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of three nodes that are fully connected. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 1, 3, 7 forms a triangle. <1, 3, 7>
2. Node 1, 5, 6 forms a triangle. <1, 5, 6>
3. Node 1, 5, 7 forms a triangle. <1, 5, 7>
4. Node 2, 3, 5 forms a triangle. <2, 3, 5>
5. Node 3, 5, 7 forms a triangle. <3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
