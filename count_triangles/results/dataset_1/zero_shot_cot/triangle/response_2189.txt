Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's enumerate the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
3. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 6>
5. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
6. Triangle <7, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
