Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will list each unique triangle found inside <> and count the total number of triangles in the end.

Let's begin by checking each possible triangle:

1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 1, and 2: <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle involving nodes 0, 1, and 6: <0, 1, 6>
3. Triangle involving nodes 0, 2, and 4: <0, 2, 4>
4. Triangle involving nodes 1, 2, and 4: <1, 2, 4>
5. Triangle involving nodes 1, 4, and 7: <1, 4, 7>
6. Triangle involving nodes 5, 6, and 8: <5, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
