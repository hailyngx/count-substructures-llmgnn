Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we will now determine the total number of triangles present in the graph:

Let's list out the triangles:

1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <1, 5, 8>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <2, 5, 8>
5. <4, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles in the graph: [5]
