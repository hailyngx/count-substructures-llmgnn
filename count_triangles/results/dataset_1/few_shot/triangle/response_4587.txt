Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 9>, <3, 8, 7>, <3, 8, 0>, <3, 2, 4>, <3, 9, 5>.
