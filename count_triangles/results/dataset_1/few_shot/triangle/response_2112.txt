Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0
