Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph:

There are 10 nodes in the graph, and the triangles are formed when three nodes are connected in a closed loop.

Checking each possible triangle by examining all the nodes:

1. Possible triangles with Node 0: <0, 2, 6>
2. Possible triangles with Node 1: No triangles formed with Node 1
3. Possible triangles with Node 2: No triangles formed with Node 2
4. Possible triangles with Node 3: No triangles formed with Node 3
5. Possible triangles with Node 4: <4, 6, 5>
6. Possible triangles with Node 5: <5, 7, 4>
7. Possible triangles with Node 6: <6, 4, 0>
8. Possible triangles with Node 7: No triangles formed with Node 7
9. Possible triangles with Node 8: No triangles formed with Node 8
10. Possible triangles with Node 9: No triangles formed with Node 9

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <4, 6, 5>, and <5, 7, 4>.
