Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
