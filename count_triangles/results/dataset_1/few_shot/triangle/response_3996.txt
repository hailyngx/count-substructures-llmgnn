Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Following the given graph information, we can determine the total number of triangles.

Let's first calculate the triangles step-by-step:
1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 2 and 5:
   - <0, 2, 5>
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with node 5:
   - <1, 5, 6>
3. Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 0, 4, and 5:
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <0, 2, 5>
4. Node 4 forms a triangle with node 6:
   - <4, 2, 6>
5. Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 0 and 9:
   - <0, 5, 9>
   - <5, 2, 9>
6. Node 6 forms a triangle with node 9:
   - <6, 2, 9>
7. Node 7 forms a triangle with node 8:
   - <7, 1, 8>
8. Node 8 forms a triangle with node 9:
   - <8, 1, 9>

Now, counting the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles = 8

Therefore, the answer is:
[8]
