Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
