Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6
