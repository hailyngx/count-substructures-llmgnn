Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, and <2, 4, 9>.
