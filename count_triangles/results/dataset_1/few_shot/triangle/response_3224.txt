Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by 3 nodes.

Let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle 3: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 4: <2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
