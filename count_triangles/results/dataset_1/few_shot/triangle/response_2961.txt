Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3
