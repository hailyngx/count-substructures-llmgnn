Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
