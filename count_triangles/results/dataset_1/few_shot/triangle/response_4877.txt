Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, we need to count the number of triangles. Let's calculate this step by step:

1. Identify the triangles in the graph:
   - <2, 7, 9>
   - <2, 7, 8>
   - <2, 9, 1>
   - <2, 9, 3>
   - <2, 9, 6>
   - <7, 9, 1>
   - <7, 9, 3>
   - <7, 9, 6>

2. Count the total number of triangles: [8]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
