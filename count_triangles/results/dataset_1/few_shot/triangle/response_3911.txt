Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph using the information provided.

Counting triangles involves identifying sets of three nodes that are all pairwise connected. If node A is connected to node B and node B is connected to node C, then nodes A, B, and C form a triangle.

Let's break it down for this graph:
1. Let's identify the triangles:
   - <0, 4, 9>
   - <0, 6, 1>
   - <0, 7, 2>
   - <0, 8, 3>
   - <1, 2, 9>
   - <5, 1, 7>
   - <5, 1, 6>
   - <5, 1, 2>

2. Counting the total number of triangles:
   - There are 8 unique triangles in total.
   
So, the answer is: 
Total number of triangles: [8]
