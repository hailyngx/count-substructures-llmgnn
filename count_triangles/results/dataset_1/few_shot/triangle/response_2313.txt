Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
- <0, 7, 3>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <2, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
