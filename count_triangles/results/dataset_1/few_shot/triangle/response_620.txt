Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
