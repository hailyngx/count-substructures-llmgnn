Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: 
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
