Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [\[3\]]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 9>, <2, 1, 9>, and <5, 2, 9>.
