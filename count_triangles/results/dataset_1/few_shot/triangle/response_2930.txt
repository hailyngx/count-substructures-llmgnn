Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
