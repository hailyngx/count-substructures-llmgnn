Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by finding all possible triangles formed by nodes in the given graph.

Calculating triangles:
1. For node 0: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8>
2. For node 1: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>
3. For node 2: No new triangles as all combinations have been covered.
4. For node 3: No new triangles.
5. For node 4: <4, 6, 9>
6. For node 5: <5, 7, 9>
7. For node 6: No new triangles.
8. For node 7: No new triangles.
9. For node 8: No new triangles.
10. For node 9: No new triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, and <5, 7, 9>.
