Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
