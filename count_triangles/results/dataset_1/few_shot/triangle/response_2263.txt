Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
