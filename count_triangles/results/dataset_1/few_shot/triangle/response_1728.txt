Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 9, 4>, <8, 9, 6>.
