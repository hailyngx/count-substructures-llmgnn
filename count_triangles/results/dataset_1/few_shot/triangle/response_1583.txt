Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
