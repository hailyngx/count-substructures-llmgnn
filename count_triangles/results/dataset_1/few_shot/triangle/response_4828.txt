Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
