Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6
