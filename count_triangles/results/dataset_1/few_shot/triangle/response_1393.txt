Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].  
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, <0, 1, 9>.
