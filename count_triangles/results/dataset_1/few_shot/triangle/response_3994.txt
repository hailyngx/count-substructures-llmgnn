Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
