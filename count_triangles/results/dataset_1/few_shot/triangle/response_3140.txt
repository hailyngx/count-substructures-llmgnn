Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are: <4, 6, 1>, <4, 8, 1>, <0, 4, 5>.
