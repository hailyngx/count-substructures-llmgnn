Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
