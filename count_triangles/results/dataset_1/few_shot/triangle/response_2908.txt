Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
There are a total of [3] unique triangles in this graph. 
The triangles are: <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <5, 7, 8>.
