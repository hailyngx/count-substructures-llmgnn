Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

Looking at the adjacency list and edges, we can see that the triangles in this graph are formed by the following nodes:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle 3: <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle 4: <5, 7, 8>
- Triangle 5: <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
