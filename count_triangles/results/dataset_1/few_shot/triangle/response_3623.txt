Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
The triangles in a graph are formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the triangles in this graph step by step.

1. Triangle <0, 2, 8>  
2. Triangle <2, 4, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
