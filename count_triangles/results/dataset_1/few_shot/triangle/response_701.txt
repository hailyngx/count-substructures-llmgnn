Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
