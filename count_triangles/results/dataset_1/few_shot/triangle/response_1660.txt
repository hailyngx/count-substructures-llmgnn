Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles by looking at each possible combination.

The triangles in the graph are:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<4, 6, 7>
These are all the unique triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
