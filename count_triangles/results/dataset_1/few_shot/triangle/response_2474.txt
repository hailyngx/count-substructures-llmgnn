Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
There are <0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 5>, and <1, 2, 6> triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
