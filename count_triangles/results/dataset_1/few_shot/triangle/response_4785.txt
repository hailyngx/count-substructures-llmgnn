Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 9, 2>
<0, 9, 7>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 2>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 9, 0>
<2, 9, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 3, 7>
<7, 4, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
