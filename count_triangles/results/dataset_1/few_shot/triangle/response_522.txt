Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
