Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2
