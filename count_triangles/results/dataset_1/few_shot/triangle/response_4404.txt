Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7
