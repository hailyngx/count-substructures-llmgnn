Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
