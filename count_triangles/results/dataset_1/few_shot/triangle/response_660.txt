Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 7, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 8>.
