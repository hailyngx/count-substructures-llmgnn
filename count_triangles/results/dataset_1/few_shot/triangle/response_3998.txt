Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in a graph are formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other. Given the graph's information with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can now identify the triangles. 

Let's list the triangles present in the graph:

1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <1, 7, 8>
5. <1, 8, 7>
6. <2, 4, 8>
7. <2, 6, 5>
8. <2, 6, 9>
9. <4, 8, 5>
10. <6, 5, 8>
11. <6, 5, 9>
12. <6, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
