Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by nodes that are all interconnected. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Looking at the adjacency list, we see that node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9. This creates a triangle between nodes 0, 7, and 6. 
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 7, forming a triangle between nodes 1, 3, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 8. There is no triangle involving these three nodes since node 8 is only connected to nodes 2 and 7, separately.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 1. This connection is already considered in the triangle involving nodes 1, 3, and 7.
5. Nodes 4 and 5 are not part of any triangles as they are not connected to any other nodes.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 7, which is again part of the triangle between nodes 0, 7, and 6.
7. Node 7 is interconnected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9. This is the same triangle as mentioned in step 1, between nodes 0, 7, and 6.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 7, and this connection is already considered in the triangle involving nodes 0, 7, and 6.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 7, once again part of the triangle between nodes 0, 7, and 6.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [1], and the unique triangle found is <0, 6, 7>.
