Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 4: <0, 2, 4>
2. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 9: <2, 5, 9>
3. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5: <0, 4, 5>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
