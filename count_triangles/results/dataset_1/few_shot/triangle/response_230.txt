Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
