Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
The unique triangles found in this graph are: <2, 4, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 9>.
