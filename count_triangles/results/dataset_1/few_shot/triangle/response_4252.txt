Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
The adjacency list indicates the neighbors of each node. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

We can identify the triangles as follows:
- Triangle 1: <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle 2: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle 4: <0, 7, 8>
- Triangle 5: <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle 6: <1, 5, 9>
- Triangle 7: <1, 7, 8>
- Triangle 8: <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle 9: <3, 7, 9>
- Triangle 10: <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10 triangles] in the given graph.
