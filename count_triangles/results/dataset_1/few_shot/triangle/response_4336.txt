Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
