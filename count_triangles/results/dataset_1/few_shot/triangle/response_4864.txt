Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
