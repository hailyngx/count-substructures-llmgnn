Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
