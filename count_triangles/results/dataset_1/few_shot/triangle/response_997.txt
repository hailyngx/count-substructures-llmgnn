Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
