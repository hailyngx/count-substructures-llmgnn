Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
