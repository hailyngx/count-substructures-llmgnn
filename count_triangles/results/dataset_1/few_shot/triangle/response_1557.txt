Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
