Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
