Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles: [5]
The unique triangles: <0, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 9>
