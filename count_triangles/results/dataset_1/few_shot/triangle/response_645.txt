Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found are: <4, 7, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <0, 4, 6>.
