Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
