Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
