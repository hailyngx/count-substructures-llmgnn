Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

From the given edges and adjacency list, we can see that the possible triangles are:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <1, 2, 8>
4. <1, 5, 9>

Counting each triangle gives us a total of [4] triangles in this graph.
