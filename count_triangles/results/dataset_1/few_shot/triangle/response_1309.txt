Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
