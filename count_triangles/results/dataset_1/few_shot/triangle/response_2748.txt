Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, and <4, 5, 7>.
