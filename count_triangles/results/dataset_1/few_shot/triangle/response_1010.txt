Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8
