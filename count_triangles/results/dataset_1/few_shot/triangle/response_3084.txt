Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
