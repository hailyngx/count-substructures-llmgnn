Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

[<0, 3, 6> <0, 6, 7> <3, 6, 0> <6, 0, 7> <0, 3, 6> <3, 6, 5> <6, 5, 4> <6, 4, 8> <6, 8, 7> <6, 7, 0> <5, 6, 0> <6, 0, 7> <5, 6, 3> <6, 3, 9> <6, 9, 7> <6, 7, 0> <0, 6, 7> <3, 6, 0> <6, 0, 7> <7, 0, 8> <7, 8, 4> <7, 4, 8> <7, 8, 1> <7, 1, 2>]

There are a total of [23] triangles in the graph.
