Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
