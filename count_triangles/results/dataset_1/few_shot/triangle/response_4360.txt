Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

The graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges with the given connections. Based on the given information, we'll examine each possible triangle formed by three nodes.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<0, 9, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 7, 2>
<4, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 5>
<4, 8, 7>

Count of triangles: [9]
