Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
The triangles in the above graph are as follows: 
[<2, 8, 9> <5, 8, 9>]
There are 2 triangles in total.
