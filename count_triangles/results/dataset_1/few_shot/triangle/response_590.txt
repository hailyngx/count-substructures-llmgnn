Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
