Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
