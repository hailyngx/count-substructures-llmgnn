Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's find them based on the given information:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [2].
