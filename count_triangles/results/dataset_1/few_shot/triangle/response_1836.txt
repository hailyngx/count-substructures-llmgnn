Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
[3 triangles]
