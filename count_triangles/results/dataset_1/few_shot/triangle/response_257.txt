Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
