Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6

Response:
