Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
