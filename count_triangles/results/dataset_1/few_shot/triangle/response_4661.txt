Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0
