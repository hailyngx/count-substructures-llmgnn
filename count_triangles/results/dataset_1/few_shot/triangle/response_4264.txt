Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
