Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
In order to find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all unique cycles of length 3 in the graph, i.e., triangles.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 8, 3>
<1, 3, 2>
<7, 3, 2>
<8, 3, 5>
<7, 3, 8>

There are 9 triangles in total in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [9].
