Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
