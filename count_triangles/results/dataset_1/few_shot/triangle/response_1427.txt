Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check all possible triangles using the provided edges and adjacency list:

1. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 5: <0, 3, 5>
2. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 5: <2, 4, 5>
3. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 8: <2, 4, 8>
4. Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9: <0, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
