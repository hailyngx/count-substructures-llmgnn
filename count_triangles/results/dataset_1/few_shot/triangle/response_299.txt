Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <6, 7, 8>
