Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

To find a triangle, we need to look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the set.

From the given information, we can see that the triangles in this graph are as follows:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <1, 5, 8>
5. <2, 6, 9>
6. <3, 7, 9>
7. <4, 6, 8>
8. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
