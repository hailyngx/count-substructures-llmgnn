Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
