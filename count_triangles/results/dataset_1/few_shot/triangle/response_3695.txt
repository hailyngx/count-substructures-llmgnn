Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
In order to count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles in the graph.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

By examining the edges and the adjacency list, we find the following triangles:
1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 1, and 7: <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle involving nodes 1, 4, and 6: <1, 4, 6>
3. Triangle involving nodes 3, 6, and 7: <3, 6, 7>
4. Triangle involving nodes 4, 5, and 6: <4, 5, 6>
5. Triangle involving nodes 6, 7, and 8: <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
