Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, there are 3 triangles in total.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 1>
<1, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
