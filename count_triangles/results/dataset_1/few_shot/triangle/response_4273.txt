Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Following the provided information, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <1, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
