Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
[<0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 5>]
[2]
