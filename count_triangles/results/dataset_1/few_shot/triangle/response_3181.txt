Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
First, let's list down all the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 8, 9>
3. Triangle <4, 5, 7>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
