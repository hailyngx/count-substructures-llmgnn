Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
