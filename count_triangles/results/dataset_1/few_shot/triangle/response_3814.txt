Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
