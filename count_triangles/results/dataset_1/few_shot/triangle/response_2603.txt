Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be found by looking for nodes that form a cycle of length 3, which in this case would be triangles.

Looking at the given graph, the triangles are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
