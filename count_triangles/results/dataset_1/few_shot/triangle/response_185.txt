Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:  
<0, 1, 9>  
<0, 2, 7>  
<0, 9, 4>  
<1, 6, 7>  
<1, 7, 4>  

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
