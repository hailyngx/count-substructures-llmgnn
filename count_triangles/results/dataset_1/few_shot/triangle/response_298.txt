Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: 

[<2, 7, 9>]

There is only 1 triangle in the graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
