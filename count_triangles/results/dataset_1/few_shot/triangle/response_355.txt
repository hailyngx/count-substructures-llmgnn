Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be counted by finding all the unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes.

Let's find all the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 5, 4>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <0, 7, 9>
5. <5, 4, 8>
6. <4, 5, 8>
7. <1, 2, 6>
8. <2, 1, 6>
9. <2, 6, 9>
10. <2, 8, 9>
11. <3, 4, 9>
12. <4, 7, 9>
13. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
