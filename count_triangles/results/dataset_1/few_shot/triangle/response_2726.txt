Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 9
