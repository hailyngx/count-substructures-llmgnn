Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [1]. 

The unique triangle found is <0, 1, 8>.
