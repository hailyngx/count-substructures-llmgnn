Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
[<0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>]
