Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
