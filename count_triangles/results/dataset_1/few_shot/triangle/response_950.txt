Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
