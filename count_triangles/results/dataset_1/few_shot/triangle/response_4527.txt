Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
From the given information, the triangles in this graph can be observed by looking at nodes that are connected to each other forming a closed loop. 

Finding all triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <3, 5, 6>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [5]
