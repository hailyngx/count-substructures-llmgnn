Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected.

Looking at the given edges and adjacency list, we can see that the triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
