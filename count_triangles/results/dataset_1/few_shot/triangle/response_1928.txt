Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
[<1, 4, 8>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [1].
