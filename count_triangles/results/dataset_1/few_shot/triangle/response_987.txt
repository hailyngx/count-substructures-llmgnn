Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
