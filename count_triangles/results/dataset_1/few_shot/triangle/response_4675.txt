Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8
