Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
