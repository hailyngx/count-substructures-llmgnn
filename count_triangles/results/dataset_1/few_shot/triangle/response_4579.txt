Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
