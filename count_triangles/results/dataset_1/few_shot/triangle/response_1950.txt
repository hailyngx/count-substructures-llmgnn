Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
