Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
