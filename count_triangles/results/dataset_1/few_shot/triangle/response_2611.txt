Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
