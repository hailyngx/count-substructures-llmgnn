Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
