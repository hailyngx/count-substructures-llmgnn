Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
