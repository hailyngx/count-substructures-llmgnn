Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
[4 triangles in total]
