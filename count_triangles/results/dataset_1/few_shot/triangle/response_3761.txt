Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <2, 9, 6>.
