Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4
