Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 9>.
