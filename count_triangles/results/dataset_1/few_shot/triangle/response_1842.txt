Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the given graph information and considering the relationships between the nodes, we can count the number of triangles. 

Triangles can be formed by considering three nodes that are all mutually connected to each other. Let's list down the triangles:

1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <0, 4, 7>
5. <3, 6, 7>
6. <3, 6, 8>
7. <3, 7, 9>
8. <6, 7, 8>

Thus, there are 8 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
