Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 3.

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 4, 5> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [3].
