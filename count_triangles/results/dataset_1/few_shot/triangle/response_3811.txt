Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
The triangles in this graph are: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, and <3, 6, 7>.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
