Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 9
