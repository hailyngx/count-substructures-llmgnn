Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8

Response:
\[ <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <8, 9, 0> \]
