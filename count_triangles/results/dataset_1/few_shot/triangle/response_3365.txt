Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
