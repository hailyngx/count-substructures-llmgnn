Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
