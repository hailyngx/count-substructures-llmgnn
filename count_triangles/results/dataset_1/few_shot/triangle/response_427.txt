Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be found by identifying the sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected to each other. 

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 9, 6>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
