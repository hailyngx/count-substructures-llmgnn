Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [2].
