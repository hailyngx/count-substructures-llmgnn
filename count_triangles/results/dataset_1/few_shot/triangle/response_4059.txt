Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7
