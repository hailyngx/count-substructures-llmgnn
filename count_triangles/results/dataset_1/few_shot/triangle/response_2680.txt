Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle 4: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 5: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 6: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 7: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 8: <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle 9: <5, 6, 8>
- Triangle 10: <5, 6, 0>
- Triangle 11: <5, 6, 7>
- Triangle 12: <6, 4, 7>
- Triangle 13: <6, 4, 7>
- Triangle 14: <8, 7, 5>
- Triangle 15: <8, 7, 0>

Since some triangles are repeated based on the connections in the graph, the total number of unique triangles in the given graph is 8. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
