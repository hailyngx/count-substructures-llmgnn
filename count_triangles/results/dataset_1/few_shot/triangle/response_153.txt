Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph based on the given information, we can use the adjacency list to identify triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can determine the triangles as follows:

1. <1, 5, 8>
2. <1, 7, 8>
3. <2, 5, 8>
4. <2, 7, 8>
5. <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
