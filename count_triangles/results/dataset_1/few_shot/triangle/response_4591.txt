Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
First, let's find the triangles in the graph. A triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

From the given edges and adjacency list, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 7, 5>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
