Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting all unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. 

After analyzing the graph, we find the following triangles:
<1, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
