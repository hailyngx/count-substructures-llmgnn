Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

1. Identify the triangles by examining each node pair that has a common neighbor.

There are 24 triangles in total. Here are the unique triangles found:
[<0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 0, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 3, 9>, <8, 1, 3>, <8, 3, 9>, <8, 9, 1>, <9, 0, 2>, <9, 0, 4>, <9, 0, 6>, <9, 2, 4>, <9, 2, 6>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 6, 3>, <9, 6, 8>, <9, 8, 1>]
So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [24].
