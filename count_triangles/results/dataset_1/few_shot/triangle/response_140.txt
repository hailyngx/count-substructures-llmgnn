Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
