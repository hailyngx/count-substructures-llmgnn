Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
[<1, 2, 4> <2, 4, 9> <2, 5, 8>]

There are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
