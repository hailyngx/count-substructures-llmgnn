Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8
