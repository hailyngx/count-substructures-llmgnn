Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all unique combinations of three nodes that form a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

From the given information, we can identify the unique triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <1, 3, 9>
3. <2, 3, 8>
4. <3, 4, 6>
5. <3, 6, 7>
6. <3, 6, 9>
7. <3, 7, 9>
8. <4, 5, 6>
9. <6, 7, 9>

There are a total of 9 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
