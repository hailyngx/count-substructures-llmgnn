Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
