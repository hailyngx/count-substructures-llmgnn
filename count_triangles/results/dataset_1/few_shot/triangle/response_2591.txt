Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
