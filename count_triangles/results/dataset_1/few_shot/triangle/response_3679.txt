Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
