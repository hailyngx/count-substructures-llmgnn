Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's start by listing the triangles found in this graph:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 6>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total number of triangles: [3]
