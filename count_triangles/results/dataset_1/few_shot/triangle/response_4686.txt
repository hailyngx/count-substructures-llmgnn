Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
