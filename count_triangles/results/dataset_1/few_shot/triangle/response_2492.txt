Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 1>
<2, 8, 4>
<3, 7, 0>
So, the total number of triangles is [5].
