Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
