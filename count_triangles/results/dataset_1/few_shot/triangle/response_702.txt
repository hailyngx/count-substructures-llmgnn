Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by sets of three interconnected nodes. Here are the steps to determine the total number of triangles:

1. Identify nodes that form triangles by having mutual connections.

From the adjacency list and edge information provided, we can see that the following triangles can be formed:
- Triangle 1: Nodes (0, 2, 5)
- Triangle 2: Nodes (0, 5, 7)
- Triangle 3: Nodes (0, 7, 8)
- Triangle 4: Nodes (5, 7, 8)

2. Count the total number of triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 8>.
