Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. 
A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

Triangles:
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
