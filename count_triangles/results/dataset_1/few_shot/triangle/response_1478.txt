Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
[<0, 3, 9>]
[<0, 4, 6>]
[<0, 4, 7>]
[<3, 4, 5>]
[<4, 5, 7>]
[<4, 6, 7>]
