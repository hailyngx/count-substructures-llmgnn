Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 4 and 8: <0, 4, 8>
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 4 and 7: <1, 4, 7> 
3. Node 3 forms a triangle with node 9: <3, 7, 9>
4. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 6: <4, 5, 6>
5. Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 2 and 8: <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
