Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
