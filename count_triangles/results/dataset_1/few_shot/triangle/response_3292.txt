Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
