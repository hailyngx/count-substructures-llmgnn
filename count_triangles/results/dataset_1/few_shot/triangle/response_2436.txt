Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected to each other. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Identify all the triangles by looking for nodes that form a cycle of length 3.
2. List the unique triangles found.
3. Count the total number of triangles.

Based on the provided information and the given edges, the unique triangles found in the graph are:

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles, we find that there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
