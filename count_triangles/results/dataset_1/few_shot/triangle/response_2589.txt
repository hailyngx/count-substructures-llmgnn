Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<[1, 4, 5], [1, 8, 5]> 

There are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
