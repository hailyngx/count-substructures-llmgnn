Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's start by counting the number of triangles in the graph:

Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, and 4.
Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 0, 2, and 9.
Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 0, 1, and 9.
Node 3 does not form any triangles.
Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 0, 6, and 9.
Node 5 does not form any triangles.
Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 9.
Node 7 forms triangles with nodes 0, 4, and 9.
Node 8 does not form any triangles.
Node 9 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, and 4.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 8, and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, and <4, 7, 9>.

So, the answer is [8].
