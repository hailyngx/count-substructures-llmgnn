Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
The triangles in the graph can be found by looking for cycles of length 3. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 5>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
