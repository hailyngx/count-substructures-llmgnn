Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
The provided graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
