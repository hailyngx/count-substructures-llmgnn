Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
The graph has the following triangles: 
[<2, 4, 8> <4, 6, 8> <4, 5, 8> <6, 8, 9> <8, 9, 6>]
There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
