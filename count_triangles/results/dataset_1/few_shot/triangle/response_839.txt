Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 0, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 0, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
