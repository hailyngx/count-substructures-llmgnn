Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [7].
