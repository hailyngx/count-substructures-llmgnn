Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 
[<1, 2, 8>, <1, 6, 8>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
