Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 9>, <3, 1, 8>, <4, 1, 9>.
