Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can find the number of triangles present.

1. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other directly or indirectly.
2. To find triangles, we need to look for nodes that are connected to each other either directly or through a common neighbor.

Let's analyze the given graph to find triangles:

- Possible triangles involving node 0: <0, 2, 4>
- Possible triangles involving node 2: <0, 2, 4>
- Possible triangles involving node 3: No triangles
- Possible triangles involving node 4: <0, 2, 4>
- Possible triangles involving node 7: <3, 7, 9>
- Possible triangles involving node 9: <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
