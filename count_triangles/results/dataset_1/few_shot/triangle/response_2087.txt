Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle: <1, 4, 5>
2. Triangle: <3, 4, 5>
3. Triangle: <3, 6, 7>
4. Triangle: <8, 9, 6>
5. Triangle: <8, 9, 2>

[Total number of triangles: 5]
