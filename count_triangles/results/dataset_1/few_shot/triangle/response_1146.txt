Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
