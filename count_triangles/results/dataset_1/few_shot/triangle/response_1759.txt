Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 9. (0, 5, 9)
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 6. (1, 3, 6)
3. Node 1 forms another triangle with nodes 8 and 6. (1, 8, 6)
4. Node 1 forms one more triangle with nodes 3 and 8. (1, 3, 8)
5. Node 8 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 6. (8, 5, 6)

Thus, there are a total of 5 triangles in this graph.

Therefore, [5] triangles are present in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, and <8, 5, 6>.
