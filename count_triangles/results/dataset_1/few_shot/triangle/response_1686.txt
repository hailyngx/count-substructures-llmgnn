Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
