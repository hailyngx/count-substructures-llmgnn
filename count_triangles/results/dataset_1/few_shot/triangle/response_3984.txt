Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
