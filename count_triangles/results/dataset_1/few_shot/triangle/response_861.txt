Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
