Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
