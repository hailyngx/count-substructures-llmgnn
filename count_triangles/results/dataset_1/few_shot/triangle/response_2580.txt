Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
The given graph consists of 10 nodes and 18 edges. Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

In order to find triangles, we will look for nodes that are connected in a triangular manner. 
A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

Let's list the triangles found in this graph:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<5, 4, 1>
<9, 2, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
