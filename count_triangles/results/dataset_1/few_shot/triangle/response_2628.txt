Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Let's find out the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify all the triangles in the graph:
   - Looking at the given edges, we can see that triangles exist when three nodes are connected to each other forming a cycle.
   - The possible triangles can be formed from the edges (0, 7, 1), (1, 7, 5), and (1, 7, 9).
  
2. Calculate the total number of triangles:
   - There are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found are: <0, 7, 1>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 7, 9>.
