Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 2>, <0, 7, 1>.
