Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
