Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
