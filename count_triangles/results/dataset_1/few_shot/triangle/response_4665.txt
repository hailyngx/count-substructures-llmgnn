Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 8, 6>, and <3, 5, 7>.
