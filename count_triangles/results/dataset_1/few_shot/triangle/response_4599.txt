Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

From the provided edges and adjacency list, the triangles in the graph are formed by the following unique combinations of nodes:
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 8, 6>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 2, 5>
<6, 8, 9>
<8, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
