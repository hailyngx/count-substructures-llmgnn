Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0
