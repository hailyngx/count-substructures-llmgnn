Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the given graph:
- Node 1, node 5, and node 9 form a triangle.
- Node 2, node 3, and node 9 form a triangle.
- Node 3, node 4, and node 6 form a triangle.
- Node 3, node 6, and node 7 form a triangle.
- Node 3, node 7, and node 9 form a triangle.
- Node 4, node 6, and node 7 form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6], and the unique triangles found are <1, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 7>.
