Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1 and 4.
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with node 7.
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with node 6.
4. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 2.
5. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 3.
6. Node 8 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 2.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. 

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 3>
<3, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
