Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 4>
<5, 9, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
