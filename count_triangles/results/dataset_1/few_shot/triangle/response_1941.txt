Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
