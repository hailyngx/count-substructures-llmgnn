Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by nodes that are interconnected with each other. To count the total number of triangles, we can identify them by finding nodes that form a cycle of length 3.

Let's list the unique triangles found in this graph:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
