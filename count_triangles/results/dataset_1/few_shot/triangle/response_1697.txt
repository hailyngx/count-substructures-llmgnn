Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's first find all the triangles in the graph by checking all possible combinations of three nodes that form a triangle:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
6. Triangle <3, 7, 8>
7. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

So, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
