Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
