Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
