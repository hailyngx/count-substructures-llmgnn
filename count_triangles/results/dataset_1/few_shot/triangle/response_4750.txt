Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in this graph:

1. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other directly.
2. We will iterate over all possible combinations of three nodes and check if they form a triangle.
3. To form a triangle, each node should be connected to both of the other two nodes directly.

Let's list the triangles:  
<3, 5, 6>  
<3, 5, 7>  

[Total number of triangles: 2]
