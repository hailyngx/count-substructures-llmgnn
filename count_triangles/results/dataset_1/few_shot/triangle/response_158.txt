Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are connected to each other in the graph.

Let's list down all the unique triangles in the given graph:

1. <1, 5, 6>
2. <1, 5, 2>
3. <1, 6, 4>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <1, 7, 2>
6. <1, 7, 4>
7. <2, 5, 6>
8. <3, 9, 1>
9. <4, 6, 7>
10. <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total in the given graph.
So, the output will be: 
[10]
