Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
