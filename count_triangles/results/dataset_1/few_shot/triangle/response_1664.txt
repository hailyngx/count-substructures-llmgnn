Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 5>, and <0, 9, 1>.
