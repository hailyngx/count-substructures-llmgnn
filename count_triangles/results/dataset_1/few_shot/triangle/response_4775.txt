Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
