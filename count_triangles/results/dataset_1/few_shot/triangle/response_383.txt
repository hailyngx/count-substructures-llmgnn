Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected.

We identify the triangles by going through each possible combination of three nodes and checking if there are edges connecting all three nodes.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
