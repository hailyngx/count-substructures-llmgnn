Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by nodes that are connected to each other. Let's count the triangles step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9.
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.

Finding triangles involving Node 0:
- Triangle <0, 3, 6>

Moving on to other nodes for more triangles.

4. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5.

Finding more triangles:
- Triangle <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle <1, 5, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles found, we have:
[Total number of triangles: 3]
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
