Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8

Response:
[<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <8, 3, 9>]
