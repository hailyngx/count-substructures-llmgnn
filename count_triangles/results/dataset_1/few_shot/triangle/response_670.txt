Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
[4]  
<0, 4, 9>  
<1, 2, 8>  
<4, 6, 5>  
<2, 8, 1>
