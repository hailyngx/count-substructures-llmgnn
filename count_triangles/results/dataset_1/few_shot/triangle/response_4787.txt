Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
