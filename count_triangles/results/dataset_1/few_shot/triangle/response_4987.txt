Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
