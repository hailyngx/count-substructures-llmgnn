Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
