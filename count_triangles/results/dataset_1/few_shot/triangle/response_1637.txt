Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7
