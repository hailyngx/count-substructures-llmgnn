Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <1, 5, 6>
5. <4, 5, 6>
6. <4, 6, 9>
7. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
