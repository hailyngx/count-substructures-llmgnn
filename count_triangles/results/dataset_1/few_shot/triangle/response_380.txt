Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5
