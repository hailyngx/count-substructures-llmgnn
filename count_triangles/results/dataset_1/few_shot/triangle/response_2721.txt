Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
