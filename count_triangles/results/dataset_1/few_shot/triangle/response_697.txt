Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
[<0, 1, 6> <1, 5, 9> <1, 6, 4>]
