Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we will determine the number of triangles.

Let's start by calculating the total number of triangles in this graph. 
[3]

The unique triangles are:
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
