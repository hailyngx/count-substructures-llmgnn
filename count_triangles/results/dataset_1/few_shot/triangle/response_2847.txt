Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 9, 6>, <3, 8, 6>, <3, 9, 6>, <4, 9, 6>, <6, 7, 8>.
