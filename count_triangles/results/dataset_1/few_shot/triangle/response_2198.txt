Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
