Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph:

Triangles can be formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Looking at the adjacency list and the given edges, we can find the triangles that can be formed:

1. Triangles involving node 0:  
   - <0, 1, 2>

2. Triangles involving node 1:
   - <1, 7, 8>

3. Triangles involving node 2:
   - <2, 4, 9>

4. Triangles involving node 4:
   - <4, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
