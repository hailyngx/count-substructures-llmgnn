Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <4, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
