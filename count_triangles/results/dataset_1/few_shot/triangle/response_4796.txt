Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
There are 2 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: 
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
