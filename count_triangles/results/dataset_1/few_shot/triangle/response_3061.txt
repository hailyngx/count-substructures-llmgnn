Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
