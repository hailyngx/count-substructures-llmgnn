Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8

Response:
There are [6] total triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, and <0, 8, 3>.
