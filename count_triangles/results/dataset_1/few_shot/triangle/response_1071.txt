Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
There are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 7, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [2].
