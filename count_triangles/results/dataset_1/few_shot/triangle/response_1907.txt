Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

Given edges: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0)

Let's consider each possible triangle:
1. (0, 4, 5)
2. (1, 6, 7)
3. (2, 5, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 5, 8>.
