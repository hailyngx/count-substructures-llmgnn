Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
