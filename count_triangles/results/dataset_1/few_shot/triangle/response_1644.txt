Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to form a closed loop of three nodes. Let's find the triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- The nodes that form triangles are {0, 2, 4}, {0, 2, 8}, {0, 4, 8}, {2, 4, 8}, {3, 4, 7}, and {3, 6, 8}.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, and <3, 6, 8>.
