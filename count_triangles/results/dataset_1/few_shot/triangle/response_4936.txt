Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
