Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
