Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- For Node 0: No triangles can be formed.
- For Node 1: No triangles can be formed.
- For Node 2: No triangles can be formed.
- For Node 3: Triangle can be formed with Nodes 1, 4, and 6, therefore, <1, 3, 4> is a triangle.
- For Node 4: No more triangles can be formed.
- For Node 5: No triangles can be formed.
- For Node 6: No more triangles can be formed.
- For Node 7: Triangle can be formed with Nodes 1, 6, and 8, therefore, <1, 7, 8> is a triangle.
- For Node 8: No more triangles can be formed.
- For Node 9: No more triangles can be formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
