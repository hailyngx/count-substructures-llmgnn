Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3
