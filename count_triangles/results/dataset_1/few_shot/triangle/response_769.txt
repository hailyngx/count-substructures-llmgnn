Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
We will count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
