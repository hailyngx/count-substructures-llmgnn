Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
