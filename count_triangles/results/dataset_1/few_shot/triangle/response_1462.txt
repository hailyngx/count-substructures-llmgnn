Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
