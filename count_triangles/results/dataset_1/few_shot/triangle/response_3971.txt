Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1
