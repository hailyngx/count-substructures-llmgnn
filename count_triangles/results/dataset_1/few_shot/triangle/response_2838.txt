Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 3>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 9, 3>.
