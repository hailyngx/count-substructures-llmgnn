Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph:

1. Check each possible triangle formed by nodes:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 8)
   - Triangle 2: (1, 3, 8)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 4: (2, 3, 5)
   - Triangle 5: (3, 7, 8)
   - Triangle 6: (3, 4, 8)

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in this graph, and they are:
<0, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 8>.
