Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are pairwise connected. 

The triangles are formed by cycles of length 3 in the graph. Let's list the triangles below:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
