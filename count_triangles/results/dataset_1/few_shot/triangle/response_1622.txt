Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
1. <5, 0, 1>
2. <5, 0, 7>
3. <5, 0, 9>
4. <5, 1, 7>
5. <5, 1, 9>
6. <5, 7, 8>
7. <5, 8, 7>
8. <5, 8, 9>
9. <5, 9, 6>
10. <5, 9, 7>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
