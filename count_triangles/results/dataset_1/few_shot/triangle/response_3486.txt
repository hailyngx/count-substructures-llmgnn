Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <1, 3, 5>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <1, 7, 8>
6. <2, 4, 7>
7. <2, 7, 8>
8. <4, 7, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
