Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
