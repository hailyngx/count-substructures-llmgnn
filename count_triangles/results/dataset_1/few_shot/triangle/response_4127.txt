Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles formed by every set of three nodes that are interconnected among themselves.

After observing the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <3, 5, 8>
2. <3, 7, 8>
3. <4, 7, 9>
4. <3, 8, 9>

Hence, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
