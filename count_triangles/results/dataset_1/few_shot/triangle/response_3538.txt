Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be found by identifying nodes that form triangles when connected. Since the graph is undirected, we consider triangles where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Here are the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 6, 7>
2. <0, 6, 8>
3. <0, 7, 8>
4. <1, 5, 4>
5. <1, 5, 8>
6. <2, 3, 4>
7. <2, 4, 8>
8. <7, 8, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
