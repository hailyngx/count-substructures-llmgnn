Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
