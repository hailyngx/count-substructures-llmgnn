Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
