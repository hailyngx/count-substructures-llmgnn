Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
