Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Triangles in the graph:
1. <1, 2, 9>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <1, 7, 8>
5. <2, 7, 9>
6. <4, 6, 7>
7. <4, 6, 9>
8. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
