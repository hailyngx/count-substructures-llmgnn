Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
[<0, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 8>] [4 triangles]
