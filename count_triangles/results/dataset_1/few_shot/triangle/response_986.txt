Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Calculating the number of triangles step-by-step:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7, forming a possible triangle <1, 4, 7>.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 4, forming a possible triangle <2, 3, 4>. Node 2 is also connected to node 8, but this does not form a triangle.
3. Node 3 is connected to node 9, but this connection doesn't create a triangle.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 2, forming a possible triangle <1, 2, 4>. Node 4 is also connected to node 6, but this doesn't form a triangle.
5. Node 6 is connected to node 4, but no triangle is formed.
6. Node 7 is connected to node 1 only, not forming a triangle.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 9, but this doesn't create a triangle.
8. Node 9 is connected to node 3, but it doesn't form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 4> and <1, 4, 7>.
