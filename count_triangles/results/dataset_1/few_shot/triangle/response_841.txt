Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find them step by step:

1. Start by listing all the triangles formed by each node:
   - Node 0: <0, 2, 6>
   - Node 1: No triangles
   - Node 2: No triangles
   - Node 3: No triangles
   - Node 4: <4, 6, 8>
   - Node 5: <0, 5, 6>
   - Node 6: <0, 6, 9>
   - Node 7: No triangles
   - Node 8: No triangles
   - Node 9: <0, 6, 9>

2. Count the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: [4]

3. List the unique triangles:
   - <0, 2, 6>
   - <4, 6, 8>
   - <0, 5, 6>
   - <0, 6, 9>
