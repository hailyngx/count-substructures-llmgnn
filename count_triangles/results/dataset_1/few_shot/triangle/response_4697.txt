Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
