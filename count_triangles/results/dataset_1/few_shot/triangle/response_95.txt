Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 9
