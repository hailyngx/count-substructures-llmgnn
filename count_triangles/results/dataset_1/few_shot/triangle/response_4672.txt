Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles where each triangle consists of 3 nodes connected to each other.

Looking at the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
2. Triangle <3, 6, 7>

Count of triangles in the graph: [2]
