Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1
