Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
