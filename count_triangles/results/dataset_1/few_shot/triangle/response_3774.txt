Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5
