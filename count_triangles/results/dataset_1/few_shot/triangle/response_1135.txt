Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
[<0, 5, 9> <1, 7, 8> <1, 4, 9> <1, 2, 8> <1, 2, 5> <1, 4, 8> <2, 5, 8> <3, 4, 9> <3, 4, 8>]
