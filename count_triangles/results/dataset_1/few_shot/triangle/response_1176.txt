Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
