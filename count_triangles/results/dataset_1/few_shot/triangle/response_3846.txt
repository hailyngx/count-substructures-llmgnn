Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
