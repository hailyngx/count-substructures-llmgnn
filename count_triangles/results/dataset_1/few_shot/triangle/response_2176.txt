Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
