Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
