Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
