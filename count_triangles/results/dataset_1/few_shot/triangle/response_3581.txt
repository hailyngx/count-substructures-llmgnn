Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
[<0, 2, 4> <0, 3, 5>]
