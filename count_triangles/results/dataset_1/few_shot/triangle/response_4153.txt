Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
