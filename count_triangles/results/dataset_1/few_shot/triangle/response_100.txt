Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can count the number of triangles by checking each set of three connected nodes. A triangle forms when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Let's list the unique triangles first:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<0, 9, 6>

Now, counting the total number of triangles, we find that there are [10] triangles in total.
