Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can check for triangles among all possible sets of 3 connected nodes. 

Triangles can only exist when node A is connected to both node B and node C, and node B is connected to node C as well in the given graph.

Checking the provided graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 3, 6>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
