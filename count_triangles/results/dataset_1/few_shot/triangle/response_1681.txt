Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
The adjacency list provided helps us to visualize the connections between nodes. To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <2, 8, 0>
2. Triangle <2, 8, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 0, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 0, 9>
6. Triangle <2, 9, 8>
7. Triangle <2, 9, 3>
8. Triangle <2, 9, 4>
9. Triangle <2, 9, 5>
10. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
11. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
12. Triangle <8, 0, 7>
13. Triangle <8, 0, 2>
14. Triangle <8, 0, 9>
15. Triangle <8, 7, 6>
16. Triangle <8, 7, 9>
17. Triangle <8, 7, 2>
18. Triangle <8, 9, 2>
19. Triangle <8, 9, 7>
20. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
21. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
22. Triangle <0, 8, 7>
23. Triangle <7, 6, 1>
24. Triangle <7, 6, 4>
25. Triangle <7, 6, 5>
26. Triangle <7, 6, 8>
27. Triangle <7, 6, 9>
28. Triangle <7, 8, 0>
29. Triangle <7, 8, 2>
30. Triangle <7, 8, 9>
31. Triangle <6, 1, 9>
32. Triangle <6, 4, 9>
33. Triangle <6, 5, 9>
