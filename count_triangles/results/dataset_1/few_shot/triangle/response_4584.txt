Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
[<0, 2, 7>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 9, 6>, <0, 9, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 3>, <5, 4, 9>, <6, 8, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
