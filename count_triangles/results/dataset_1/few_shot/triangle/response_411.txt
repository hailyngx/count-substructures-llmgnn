Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other. Let's identify and count the triangles step-by-step:

1. Identify the triangles:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 4, 9>

2. Count the number of identified triangles: 
Total number of triangles = 2

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
