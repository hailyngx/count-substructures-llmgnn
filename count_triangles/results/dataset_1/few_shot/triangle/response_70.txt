Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [5]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, and <5, 8, 7>.
