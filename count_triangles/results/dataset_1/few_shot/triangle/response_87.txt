Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 3.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 9> 

Therefore, the answer is [3].
