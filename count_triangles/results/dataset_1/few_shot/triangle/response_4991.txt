Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
There are a total of 10 unique triangles present in the given graph structure. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<7, 3, 9>
<8, 5, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
