Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.  
   - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 3>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 2, 8>
   
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.  
   - Triangle 3: <0, 2, 3>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 2, 8>
   
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5.  
   - Triangle 5: <0, 3, 4>
   
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.  
   No new triangles are formed involving node 4.

5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.  
   - Triangle 6: <3, 5, 8>
   
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.  
   No new triangles are formed involving node 6.

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.  
   No new triangles are formed involving node 7.

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.  
   - Triangle 7: <0, 2, 8>
   - Triangle 8: <3, 5, 8>
   
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.  
   No new triangles are formed involving node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
