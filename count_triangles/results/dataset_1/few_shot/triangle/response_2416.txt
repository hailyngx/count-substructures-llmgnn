Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each possible triangle involving three nodes. A triangle exists when there are three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Calculating the number of triangles can be done in various ways, but considering that we have 10 nodes, we can check each set of three nodes to see if they form a triangle.

After checking all possible combinations, we find that there are 4 unique triangles in the graph:
<0, 5, 4>, <3, 1, 6>, <3, 2, 9>, <5, 8, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
