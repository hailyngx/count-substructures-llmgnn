Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by finding nodes that are connected to each other in a way that forms a triangle. Let's count the number of triangles step by step:

1. Check each node and its neighbors to find triangles:
   - Node 0: (0, 3, 9)
   - Node 1: (1, 4, 6)
   - Node 2: No triangles
   - Node 3: (0, 2, 3)
   - Node 4: (1, 4, 5)
   - Node 5: (2, 4, 5), (4, 5, 9)
   - Node 6: (1, 6, 7)
   - Node 7: No triangles
   - Node 8: No triangles
   - Node 9: (0, 5, 9)

2. Count the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: [6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are:
   - <0, 3, 9>
   - <1, 4, 6>
   - <0, 2, 3>
   - <1, 4, 5>
   - <2, 4, 5>
   - <4, 5, 9>
