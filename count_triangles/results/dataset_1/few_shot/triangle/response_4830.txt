Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by finding nodes that are connected to each other. Given the edges provided, the triangles can be found by examining each possible combination of three connected nodes.

The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 5>
<6, 5, 2>
<9, 8, 0>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
