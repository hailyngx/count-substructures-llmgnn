Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we will first identify all the unique triangles based on the given edges.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 9>
<8, 9, 5>

Now, counting the total number of triangles:
[8]
