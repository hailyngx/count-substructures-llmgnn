Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
