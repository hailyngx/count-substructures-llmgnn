Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, and <1, 6, 9>.
