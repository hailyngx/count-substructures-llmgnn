Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
