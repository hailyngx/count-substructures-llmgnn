Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is found by counting unique triangles formed by nodes connected to each other. 

There are 4 unique triangles in this graph:

1. <0, 7, 1>
2. <0, 7, 2>
3. <0, 8, 4>
4. <0, 9, 2>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
