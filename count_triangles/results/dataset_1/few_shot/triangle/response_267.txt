Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
