Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
[<2, 0, 5>, <9, 7, 5>]

There are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
