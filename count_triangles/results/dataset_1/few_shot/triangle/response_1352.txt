Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
[3] 
<2, 3, 8>
