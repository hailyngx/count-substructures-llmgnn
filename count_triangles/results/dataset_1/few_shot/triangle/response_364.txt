Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <7, 1, 4>
2. <7, 4, 9>
3. <7, 1, 9>
4. <9, 6, 7>
5. <9, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
