Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
