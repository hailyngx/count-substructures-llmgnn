Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
