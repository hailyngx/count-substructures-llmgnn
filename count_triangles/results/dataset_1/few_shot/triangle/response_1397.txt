Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
[<0, 7, 8> <1, 7, 8> <2, 3, 8> <2, 7, 8>]
