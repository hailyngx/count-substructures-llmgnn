Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we can find the total number of triangles and unique triangles as follows:

1. Total number of triangles: [6]

2. Unique triangles:
   - <3, 5, 8>
   - <4, 5, 8>
   - <4, 5, 9>
   - <4, 8, 9>
   - <5, 8, 9>
   - <5, 9, 6>
