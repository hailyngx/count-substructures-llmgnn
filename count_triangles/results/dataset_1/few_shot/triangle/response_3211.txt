Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
