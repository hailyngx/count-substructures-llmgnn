Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
