Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 1>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 5>

So, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
