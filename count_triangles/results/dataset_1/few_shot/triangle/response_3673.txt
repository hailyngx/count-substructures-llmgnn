Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
