Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph. 

From the given information, we can see that there are several triangles in the graph. Let's list them:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <2, 4, 8>
5. <2, 3, 6>
6. <3, 5, 6>
7. <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
