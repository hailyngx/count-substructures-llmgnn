Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
