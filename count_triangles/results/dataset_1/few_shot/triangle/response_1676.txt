Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
We will now find the number of triangles in the given graph.

Let's begin by checking all possible triangles in the graph. For each node, we will see if there is a path of length 2 to another node, indicating the presence of a triangle.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
