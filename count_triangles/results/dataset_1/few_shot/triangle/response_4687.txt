Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be found by counting all the triangles formed by sets of three connected nodes. Here, a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other either directly or through other nodes.

Let's identify the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. For node 0, the possible triangles are:
   - <0, 7, 5>
   - <0, 8, 5>
   - <0, 9, 6>

2. For node 2, the possible triangles are:
   - <2, 1, 3>
   - <2, 8, 5>
   - <2, 9, 6>

3. For node 3, the possible triangle is:
   - <3, 6, 5>

4. For node 5, the possible triangle is:
   - <5, 6, 7>

5. For node 6, the possible triangle is:
   - <6, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
