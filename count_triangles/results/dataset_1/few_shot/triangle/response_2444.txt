Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [\<1, 2, 7\>].
