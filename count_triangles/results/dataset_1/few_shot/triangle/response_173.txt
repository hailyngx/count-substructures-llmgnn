Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify all triangles:
   - Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 2, 7, and 9
   - Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 9
   - Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 9

2. Now, let's count the total number of triangles by summing up the unique triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: [3]

3. List of unique triangles found:
   - <0, 2, 7>
   - <0, 2, 9>
   - <2, 6, 9>
