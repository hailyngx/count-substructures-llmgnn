Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
