Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
Considering the given graph, let's find the total number of triangles. 

Starting with node 0, the neighbors of node 0 are 4, 5, 7, and 9. 
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle 2: <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle 3: <0, 7, 8>
  
Moving to node 1, the neighbors of node 1 are 3, 6, and 7. No triangles are formed with node 1 as they are already counted.

Next, for node 2, only one triangle can be formed with node 2 which is <0, 2, 9>.

For node 3, the neighbors are 1 and 6, there are no new triangles with node 3.

Node 4 forms a triangle with node 6 and 0, which was already counted.

Node 5 can form a triangle with 0 and 7, which was already counted.

Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 0, 4, 1, and 8, all of which were already counted.

Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 0, 5, and 8, which are already accounted for.

Node 8 forms a triangle with nodes 6, 7, and 0, which were all previously counted.

The last node 9 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 2, already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
