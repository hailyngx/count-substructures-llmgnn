Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
