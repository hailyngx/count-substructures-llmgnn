Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
