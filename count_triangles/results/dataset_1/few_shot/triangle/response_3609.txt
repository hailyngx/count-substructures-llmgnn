Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
