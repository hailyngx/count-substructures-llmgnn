Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4
