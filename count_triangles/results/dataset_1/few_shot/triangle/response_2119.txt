Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
