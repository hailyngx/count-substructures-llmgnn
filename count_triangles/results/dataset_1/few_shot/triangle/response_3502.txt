Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is[<2, 9, 0>, <2, 9, 1>, <4, 9, 6>]. Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
