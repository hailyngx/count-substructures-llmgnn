Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6
