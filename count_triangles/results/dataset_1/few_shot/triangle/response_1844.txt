Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
