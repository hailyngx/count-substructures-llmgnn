Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
