Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7
