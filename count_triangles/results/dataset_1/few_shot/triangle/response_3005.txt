Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<2, 0, 4>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 1>
<8, 5, 3>
<0, 4, 6>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
