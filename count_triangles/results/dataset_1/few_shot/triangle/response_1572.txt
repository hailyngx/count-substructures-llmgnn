Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <2, 5, 7>

So, there are 4 triangles in total.
