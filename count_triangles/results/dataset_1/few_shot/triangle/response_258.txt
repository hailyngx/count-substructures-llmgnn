Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 7>]
