Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has 15 unique triangles. The triangles are as follows:
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 9, 2>
<9, 2, 6>
<9, 2, 7>

So, the total number of triangles is [15].
