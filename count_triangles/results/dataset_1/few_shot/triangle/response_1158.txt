Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7
