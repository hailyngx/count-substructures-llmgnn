Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 6>, <3, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>.
