Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
