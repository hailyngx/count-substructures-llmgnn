Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
