Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 3.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<0, 4, 5> 

Therefore, the answer is [3].
