Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
