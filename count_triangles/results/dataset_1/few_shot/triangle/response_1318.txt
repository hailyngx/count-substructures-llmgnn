Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
[<0, 2, 5>, <5, 6, 7>]
