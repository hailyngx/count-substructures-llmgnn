Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
There are a total of 3 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
