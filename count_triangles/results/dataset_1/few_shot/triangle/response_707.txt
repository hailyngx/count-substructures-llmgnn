Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
