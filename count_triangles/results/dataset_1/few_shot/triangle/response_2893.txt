Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
