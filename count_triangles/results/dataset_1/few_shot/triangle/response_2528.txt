Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can check for all possible triangles formed by the nodes and count how many of them actually exist based on the given edges.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
