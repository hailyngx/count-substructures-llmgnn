Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
