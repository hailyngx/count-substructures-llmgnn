Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can determine the total number of triangles present.

Let's identify the triangles step by step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
2. Node 3 is connected back to node 0 and doesn't have any other adjacent nodes connected to node 0, so no triangle involving 0 and 3.
3. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 8. The triangle formed with 0-7-1 is <0, 7, 1>.
4. Checking other nodes with similar methods, we find the following triangles:
   - <0, 7, 1>
   - <0, 7, 5>
   - <0, 7, 6>
   - <0, 7, 8>
   - <2, 7, 5>
   - <2, 7, 6>
   - <2, 6, 9>
   - <5, 7, 6>
   - <6, 7, 8>
   - <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
