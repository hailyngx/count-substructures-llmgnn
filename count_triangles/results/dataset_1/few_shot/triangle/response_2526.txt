Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5
