Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to check each possible triangle consisting of three nodes connected to each other.

Looking at the graph and the provided edges and connections, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 5, 8>
2. <0, 6, 8>
3. <3, 6, 7>

So, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
