Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
