Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculating the number of triangles in the given graph:
Step 1: Counting the triangles based on common neighbors of nodes (triangles indicated inside brackets):
  - Triangle <0, 2, 4> (common neighbor 5)
  - Triangle <0, 2, 5> (common neighbor 6)
  - Triangle <0, 4, 5> (common neighbor 6)
  - Triangle <1, 2, 6> (common neighbor 3)
  - Triangle <2, 3, 9> (common neighbor 1)
  - Triangle <2, 4, 9> (common neighbor 0)
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
