Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
