Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
