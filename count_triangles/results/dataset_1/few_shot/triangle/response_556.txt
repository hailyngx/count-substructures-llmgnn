Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 8>.
