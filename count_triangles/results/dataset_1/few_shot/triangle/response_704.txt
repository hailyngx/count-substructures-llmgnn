Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
