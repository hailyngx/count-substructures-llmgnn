Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 5 and 6:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 5, 6>

2. Node 1 forms a triangle with node 6:
   - Triangle 2: <1, 4, 6>

3. Node 2 forms a triangle with node 4:
   - Triangle 3: <2, 4, 6>

4. Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8:
   - Triangle 4: <1, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 5: <2, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 6: <4, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 7: <4, 6, 8>

5. Node 5 forms a triangle with node 8:
   - Triangle 8: <5, 4, 8>

6. Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4:
   - Triangle 9: <0, 5, 4>
   - Triangle 10: <0, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 11: <1, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 12: <2, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 13: <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
