Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
We can count the number of triangles in the given graph by identifying all the triangles formed by sets of three nodes connected to each other.

To find the triangles in the graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. In this case, we can see that the following triangles exist:
1. <4, 2, 8>
2. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
