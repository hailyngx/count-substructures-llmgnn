Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph: 
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<0, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [7].
