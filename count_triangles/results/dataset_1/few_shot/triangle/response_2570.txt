Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to consider the nodes and their connections carefully.

Looking at the given edges and adjacency lists, we can determine the triangles in the graph.

The triangles in the graph are formed by the following sets of nodes:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <0, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
