Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
