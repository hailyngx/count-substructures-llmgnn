Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
