Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
The triangles found in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 0>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 9, 5>
<4, 7, 8>
<9, 5, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [7].
