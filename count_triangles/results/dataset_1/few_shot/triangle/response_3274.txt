Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, and <7, 9, 1>.
