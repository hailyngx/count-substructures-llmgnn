Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
The adjacency list provided above gives a clear picture of which nodes are connected to each other. To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's analyze the graph to determine the triangles present:

We can identify the following triangles: <0, 6, 7> and <5, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
