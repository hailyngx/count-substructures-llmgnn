Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8
