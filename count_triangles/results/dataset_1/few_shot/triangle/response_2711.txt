Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
