Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
