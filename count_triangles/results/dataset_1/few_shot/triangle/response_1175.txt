Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
