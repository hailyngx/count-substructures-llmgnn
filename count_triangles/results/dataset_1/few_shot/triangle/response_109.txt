Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3
