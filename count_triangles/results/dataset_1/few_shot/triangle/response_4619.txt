Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
