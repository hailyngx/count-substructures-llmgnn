Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
The unique triangles in the given graph are: <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, and <1, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
