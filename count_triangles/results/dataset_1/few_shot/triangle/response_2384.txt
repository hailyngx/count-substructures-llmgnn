Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by connecting three nodes.

Based on the given information:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to node 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.

Now, let's list all the unique triangles:
1. <1, 3, 1>
2. <1, 4, 1>
3. <1, 6, 1>
4. <1, 8, 1>
5. <1, 9, 1>
6. <1, 9, 2>
7. <1, 9, 5>
8. <4, 5, 4>
9. <5, 7, 5>
10. <5, 9, 5>

Counting the unique triangles, we find that there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
