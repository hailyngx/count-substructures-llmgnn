Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
