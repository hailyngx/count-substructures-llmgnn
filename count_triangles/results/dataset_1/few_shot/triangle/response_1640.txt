Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
