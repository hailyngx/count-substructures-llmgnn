Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 7, 3>
4. <0, 7, 4>
5. <2, 3, 4>
6. <2, 3, 9>
7. <4, 7, 3>
8. <4, 7, 9>
9. <6, 9, 2>
10. <6, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
