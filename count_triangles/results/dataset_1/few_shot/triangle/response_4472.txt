Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
