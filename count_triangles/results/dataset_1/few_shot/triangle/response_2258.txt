Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

From the given adjacency list, we can list down the triangles:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <3, 4, 7>
5. <1, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
