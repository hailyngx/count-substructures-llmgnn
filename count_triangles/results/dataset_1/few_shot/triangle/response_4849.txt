Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
