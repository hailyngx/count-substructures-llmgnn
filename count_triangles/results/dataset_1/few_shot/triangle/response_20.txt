Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
