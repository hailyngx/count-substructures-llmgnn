Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
