Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 3.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 0.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 4.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
10. Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Now, let's list the triangles in the graph:
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
