Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 8.
2. Node 2 is connected to node 6.
3. Node 3 is connected to node 4 and node 6.
4. Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9.
5. Node 5 is connected to node 7.
6. Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to node 5 and node 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7.
9. Node 9 is connected to node 4 and node 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle 2: <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle 3: <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle 4: <4, 8, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
