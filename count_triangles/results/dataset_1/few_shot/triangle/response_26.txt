Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by nodes that are connected to each other. Let's find the triangles step by step:

1. Find all the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 5, 2>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 5, 9>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 7, 2>
   - Triangle 5: <2, 1, 7>
   - Triangle 6: <2, 5, 0>
   - Triangle 7: <2, 7, 4>
   - Triangle 8: <4, 5, 7>
   - Triangle 9: <4, 5, 9>
   - Triangle 10:<5, 6, 9>
   - Triangle 11:<5, 0, 2>
   - Triangle 12:<5, 2, 7>

2. Count the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 12

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
