Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
