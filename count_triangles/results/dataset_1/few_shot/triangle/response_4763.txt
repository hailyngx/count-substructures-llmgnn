Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
The adjacency list representation of the graph is as follows:
Node 0: 3
Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 8
Node 3: 0, 1
Node 4: 5, 9
Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 8
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 2, 5, 8
Node 8: 2, 5, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 4, 8

Now, let's find the total number of triangles in the graph:
There are 6 unique triangles in the graph:

<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
