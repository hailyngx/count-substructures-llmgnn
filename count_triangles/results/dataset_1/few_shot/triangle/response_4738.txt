Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:
A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
[<6, 7, 9>]

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is:
[1]
