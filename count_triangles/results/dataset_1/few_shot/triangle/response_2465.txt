Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are: <1, 5, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 8>.
