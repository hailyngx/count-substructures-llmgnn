Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
