Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
