Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by nodes connected to each other in a way that they create a closed loop. To find the triangles, we can iterate through all possible sets of three nodes and check if they form a triangle by having connections between each pair of nodes.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
