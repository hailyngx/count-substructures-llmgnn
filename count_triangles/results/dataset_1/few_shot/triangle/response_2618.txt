Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
The adjacency list provides us with the information needed to determine the number of triangles in the given graph.

Triangles in a graph are formed when three nodes are connected by edges in such a way that each of the three nodes is connected to the other two. 

Let's count the triangles:

1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 3, and 5.
2. Triangle involving nodes 1, 2, and 8.
3. Triangle involving nodes 1, 5, and 8.
4. Triangle involving nodes 2, 7, and 8.
5. Triangle involving nodes 6, 7, and 9.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, and <6, 7, 9>.
