Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <2, 4, 8>
3. <2, 4, 9>
4. <2, 8, 9>
5. <4, 5, 7>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
