Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 2>, <5, 9, 4>.
