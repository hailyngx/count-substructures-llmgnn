Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

A triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other. We can find triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other in sets of three.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can list out the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

There are a total of 9 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
