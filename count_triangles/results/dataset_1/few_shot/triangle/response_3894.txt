Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
