Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
Following the adjacency list and the given edges, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

Triangles:
<2, 4, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
