Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
5. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 1, 4>
7. Triangle <3, 0, 7>
8. Triangle <4, 1, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 8]
