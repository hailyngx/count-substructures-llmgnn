Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
