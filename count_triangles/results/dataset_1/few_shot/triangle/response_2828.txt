Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 5) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: <3, 0, 2>, <3, 5, 7>. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
