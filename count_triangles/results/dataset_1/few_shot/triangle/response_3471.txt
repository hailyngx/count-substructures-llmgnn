Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
Checking for triangles involves looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the triangles step by step:

1. Node 0: (0, 6, 0), (0, 8, 0), (0, 9, 0) - No triangles involving node 0.
2. Node 1: (1, 4, 1), (1, 9, 1) - No triangles involving node 1.
3. Node 2: (2, 9, 2) - No triangles involving node 2.
4. Node 3: Not connected to any other nodes.
5. Node 4: (4, 1, 4), (4, 7, 4) - No triangles involving node 4.
6. Node 5: Not part of any triangle.
7. Node 6: Not part of any triangle.
8. Node 7: (7, 4, 7), (7, 8, 7), (7, 9, 7) - Triangle <4, 7, 8>.
9. Node 8: (8, 0, 8), (8, 7, 8) - No triangles involving node 8.
10. Node 9: (9, 0, 9), (9, 1, 9), (9, 2, 9), (9, 5, 9), (9, 7, 9) - Triangles <0, 1, 9>, and <7, 9, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <4, 7, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, and <7, 9, 0>.
