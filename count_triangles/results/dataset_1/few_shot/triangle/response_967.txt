Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
