Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
