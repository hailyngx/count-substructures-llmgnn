Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
