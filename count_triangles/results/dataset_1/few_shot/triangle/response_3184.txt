Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0
