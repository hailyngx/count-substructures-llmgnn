Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
