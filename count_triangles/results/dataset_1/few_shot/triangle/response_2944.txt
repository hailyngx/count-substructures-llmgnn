Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph information, we can count the number of triangles by looking for nodes that form triangles with each other. 
A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

Looking at the given edges and adjacency list, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <3, 5, 8>
5. <5, 6, 8>
6. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
