Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
