Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3
