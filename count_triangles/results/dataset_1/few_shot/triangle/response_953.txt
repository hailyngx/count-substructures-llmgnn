Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <1, 5, 7>
6. <1, 5, 9>
7. <1, 7, 9>
8. <5, 7, 9>
9. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph.
