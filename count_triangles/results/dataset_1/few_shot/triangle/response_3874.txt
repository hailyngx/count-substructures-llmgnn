Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
