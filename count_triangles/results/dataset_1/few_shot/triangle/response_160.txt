Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
The triangles found in this graph are as follows: 
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 7, 3>
<1, 8, 4>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 1, 8>
<6, 4, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
<8, 5, 1>
<8, 9, 6>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
