Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Calculate the number of triangles formed by each node.
- Node 0 can form triangles with nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 can form triangles with nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 2 can form a triangle with nodes 4.
- Node 3 can form triangles with nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 4 can form triangles with nodes 8.
- Node 6 can form a triangle with node 8.

Step 2: List out all unique triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 9>

Step 3: Count the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]
