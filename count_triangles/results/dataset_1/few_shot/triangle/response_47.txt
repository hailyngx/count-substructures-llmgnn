Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

[<0, 4, 9>]

There is only 1 triangle in this graph, so the total number of triangles is [1].
