Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
