Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
