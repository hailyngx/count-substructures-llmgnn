Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
