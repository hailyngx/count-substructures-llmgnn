Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
The given graph has 3 triangles. 

[List of triangles: <1, 5, 9>, <5, 3, 1>, <6, 9, 1>]  
[Total number of triangles: 3]
