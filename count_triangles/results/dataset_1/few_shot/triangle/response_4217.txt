Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
