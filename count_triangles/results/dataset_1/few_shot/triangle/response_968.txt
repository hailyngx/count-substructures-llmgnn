Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
