Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
