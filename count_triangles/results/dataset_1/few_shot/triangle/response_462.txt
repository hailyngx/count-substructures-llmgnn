Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
