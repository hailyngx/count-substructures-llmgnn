Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
