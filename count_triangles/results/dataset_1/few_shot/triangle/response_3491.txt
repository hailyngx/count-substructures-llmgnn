Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 8, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 8, 0>.
