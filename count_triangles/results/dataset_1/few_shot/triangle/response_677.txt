Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by nodes that are all interconnected with each other. 

Let's identify the triangles by checking each possible combination of three nodes:

1. Nodes 0, 2, and 6 form a triangle.
2. Nodes 0, 5, and 9 form a triangle.
3. Nodes 0, 6, and 9 form a triangle.
4. Nodes 1, 4, and 8 form a triangle.
5. Nodes 8, 5, and 9 form a triangle.

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph, which are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, and <8, 5, 9>.
