Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 9>.
