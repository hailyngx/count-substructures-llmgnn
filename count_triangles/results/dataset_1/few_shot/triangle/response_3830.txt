Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. First, let's identify all triangles in the graph by checking for nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all pairwise connected.

2. For each node, we will check if there is a triangle formed with its connected nodes.

3. Once we find all the triangles, we will count the total number of unique triangles and list them.

After examining all the relationships between nodes, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
