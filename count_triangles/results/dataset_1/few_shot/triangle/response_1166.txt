Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
