Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
[<0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 9>]
