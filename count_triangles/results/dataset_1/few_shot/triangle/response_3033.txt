Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
