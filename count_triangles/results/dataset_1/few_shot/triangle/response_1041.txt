Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: 
<0, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<6, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
