Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, and <4, 8, 9>.
