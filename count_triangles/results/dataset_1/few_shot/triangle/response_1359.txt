Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3
