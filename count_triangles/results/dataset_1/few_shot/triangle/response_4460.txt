Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
