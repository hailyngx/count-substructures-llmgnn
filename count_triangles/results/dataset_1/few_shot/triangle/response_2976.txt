Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Find all triangles using the given edges:
- Triangles can be formed by finding nodes that are connected in a triangular manner. For example, if nodes A, B, and C are connected such that (A, B), (B, C), and (C, A) are edges, then they form a triangle.
- Looking at the provided edges, we see that the following triangles exist:
    <0, 2, 7>
    <1, 2, 8>
    <1, 6, 8>
    <1, 8, 9>
    <2, 0, 1>
    <2, 1, 8>
    <8, 6, 1>
    <8, 6, 9>
    <9, 1, 8>
    <9, 4, 5>
    <9, 7, 0>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles found above:
- The total number of triangles in this graph is [11].

So, the answer is [11].
