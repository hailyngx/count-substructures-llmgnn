Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
