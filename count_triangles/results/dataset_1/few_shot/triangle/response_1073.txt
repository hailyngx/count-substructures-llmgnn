Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 3>, <4, 5, 8>, and <8, 9, 4>.
