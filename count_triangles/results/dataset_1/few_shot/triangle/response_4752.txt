Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6

Response:
First, we identify the triangles using the given graph:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 3)
- Triangle 2: (0, 3, 8)
- Triangle 3: (0, 4, 7)
- Triangle 4: (0, 4, 9)
- Triangle 5: (0, 7, 5)
- Triangle 6: (0, 8, 5)

From the identified triangles, we observe that each of the triangles includes node 0. So, we need to count how many triangles node 0 is part of.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. The list of unique triangles found is <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 8, 5>.
