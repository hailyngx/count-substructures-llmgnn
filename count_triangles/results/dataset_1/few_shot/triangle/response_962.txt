Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
