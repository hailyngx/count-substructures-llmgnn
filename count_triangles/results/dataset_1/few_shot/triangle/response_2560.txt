Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
