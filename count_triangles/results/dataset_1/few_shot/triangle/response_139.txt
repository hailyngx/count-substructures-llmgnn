Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
[<0, 4, 9>, <0, 9, 2>, <8, 6, 5>, <8, 6, 3>, <8, 9, 2>]

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
