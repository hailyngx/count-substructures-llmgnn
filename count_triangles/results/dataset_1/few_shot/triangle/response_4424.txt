Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected with each other.

Based on the given information and the adjacency list, let's determine the triangles:

1. Triangle: <2, 4, 6>
2. Triangle: <2, 6, 8>
3. Triangle: <4, 6, 9>
4. Triangle: <5, 6, 8>
5. Triangle: <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
