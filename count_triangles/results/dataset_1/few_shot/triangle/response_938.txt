Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 4, 3>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, and <3, 5, 6>.
