Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].

The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 6> and <1, 7, 9>.
