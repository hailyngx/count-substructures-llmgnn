Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
