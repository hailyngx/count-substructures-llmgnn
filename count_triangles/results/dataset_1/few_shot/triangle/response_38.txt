Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
