Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the graph. 
The triangles are: 
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
So, the total number of triangles is [4].
