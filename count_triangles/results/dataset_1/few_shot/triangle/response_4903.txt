Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
