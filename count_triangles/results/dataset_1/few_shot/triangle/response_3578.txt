Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

Since we have 10 nodes, let's check each node's neighbors to identify triangles:
- For Node 0: Neighbors are [1, 6, 8]. No triangle found.
- For Node 1: Neighbors are [0, 2, 3, 4]. Triangle <0, 1, 4> found.
- For Node 2: Neighbors are [1, 3, 4]. Triangle <1, 2, 4> found.
- For Node 3: Neighbors are [1, 2, 4]. Triangle <1, 3, 4> found.
- For Node 4: Neighbors are [1, 2, 3, 5, 9]. Triangles <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, and <3, 4, 9> found.
- For Node 5: Neighbors are [4, 9]. No triangle found.
- For Node 6: Neighbors are [0]. No triangle found.
- For Node 7: Isolated node, no triangle.
- For Node 8: Neighbors are [0]. No triangle found.
- For Node 9: Neighbors are [4, 5]. No triangle found.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, and <3, 4, 9>.
