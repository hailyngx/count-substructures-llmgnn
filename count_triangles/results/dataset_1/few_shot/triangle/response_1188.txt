Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0
