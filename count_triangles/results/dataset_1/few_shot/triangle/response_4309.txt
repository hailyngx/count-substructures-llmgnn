Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. By observing the edges provided, we can see that the triangles in the graph are formed by the following sets of nodes:
    - (1, 2, 3)
    - (1, 3, 5)
    - (2, 3, 5)
    
2. Now let's count the total number of triangles by counting each unique triangle:
    - Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [3]
    
3. List of unique triangles found:
    - <1, 2, 3>
    - <1, 3, 5>
    - <2, 3, 5>
