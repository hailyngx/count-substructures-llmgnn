Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
