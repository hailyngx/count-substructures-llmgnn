Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
