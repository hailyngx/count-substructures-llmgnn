Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
[6]
<0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 9>
