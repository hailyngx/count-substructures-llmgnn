Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be found by checking the nodes that form cycles of length 3. 

The triangles in this graph are:
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
