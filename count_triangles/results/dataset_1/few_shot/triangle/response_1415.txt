Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Here is the breakdown:

1. Node 0: <0, 4, 8>
2. Node 3: <3, 6, 7>
3. Node 4: <4, 6, 7>
4. Node 5: <5, 6, 7>
5. Node 6: <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, based on the triangles found, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
