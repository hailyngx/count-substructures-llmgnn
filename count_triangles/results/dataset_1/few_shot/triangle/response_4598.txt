Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all directly connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Identify triangles using the adjacency list:
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 4, 2>
- <1, 6, 9>

2. Count the total number of triangles and list them:
- Number of triangles: [3]
- Unique triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 2>, <1, 6, 9>
