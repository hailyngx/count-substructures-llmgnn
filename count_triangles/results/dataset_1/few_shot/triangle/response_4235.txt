Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 6, 4>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <3, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
