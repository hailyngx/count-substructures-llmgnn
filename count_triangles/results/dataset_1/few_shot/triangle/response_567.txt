Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Based on the given graph, the total number of triangles can be calculated by examining all possible triangles formed by the edges. 

For each node, let's find the triangles that can be formed with that node as one of the vertices:

Node 0: 
- Triangles: <0, 4, 7> 
- Triangles: <0, 5, 7> 
- Triangles: <0, 7, 4> 
- Triangles: <0, 7, 5> 

Node 4: 
- Triangles: <4, 0, 7> 

Node 5: 
- Triangles: <5, 0, 7> 

Node 7: 
- Triangles: <7, 0, 5> 

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <4, 0, 7>, <5, 0, 7>
