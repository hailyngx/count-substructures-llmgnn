Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
