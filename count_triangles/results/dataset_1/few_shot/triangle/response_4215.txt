Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
