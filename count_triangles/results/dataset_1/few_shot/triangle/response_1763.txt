Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated step-by-step by examining each possible triangle formed by the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 5, 6, and 7.
2. Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 6, 7, and 8.
3. Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 1.
4. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 8.
5. Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 4.
6. Node 8 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 6.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 1>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 4>, <4, 6, 8>.
