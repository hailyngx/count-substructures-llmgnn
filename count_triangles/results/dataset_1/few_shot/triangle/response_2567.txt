Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

From the given edges and adjacency list, we can see the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <2, 4, 6>
5. <2, 4, 7>
6. <2, 6, 7>
7. <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 7, represented as [7].
