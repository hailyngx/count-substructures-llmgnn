Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Following the steps for counting triangles:

1. Node 0 has connections with nodes 3, 4, and 6. 
   - Checking for triangles involving node 0: Triangle <0, 3, 6> found.

2. Node 1 has a connection with node 9.
   - No triangles can be formed with only one connection.

3. Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
   - No triangle can be formed with node 2.

4. Node 3 has a connection with node 0.
   - No triangles can be formed with only one connection.

5. Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 5, and 7.
   - Checking for triangles involving node 4: Triangle <0, 4, 5> found.

6. Node 5 has connections with nodes 4, 6, and 8.
   - No new triangles can be formed involving node 5.

7. Node 6 has connections with nodes 0 and 5.
   - No new triangles can be formed involving node 6.

8. Node 7 has a connection with node 4.
   - No triangles can be formed with only one connection.

9. Node 8 has a connection with node 5.
   - No triangles can be formed with only one connection.

10. Node 9 has a connection with node 1.
   - No triangles can be formed with only one connection.

The total number of triangles: [2].
The unique triangles found: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 5>.
