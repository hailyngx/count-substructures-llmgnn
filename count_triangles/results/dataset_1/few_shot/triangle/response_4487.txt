Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
