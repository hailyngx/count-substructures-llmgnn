Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
