Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
