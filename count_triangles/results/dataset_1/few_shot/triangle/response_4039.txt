Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].  
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <3, 8, 7>.
