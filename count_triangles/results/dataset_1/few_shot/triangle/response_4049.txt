Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
