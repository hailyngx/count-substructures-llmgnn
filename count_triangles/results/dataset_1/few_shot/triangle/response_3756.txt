Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5
