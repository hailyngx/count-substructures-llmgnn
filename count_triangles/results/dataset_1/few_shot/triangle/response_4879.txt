Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
By examining the given graph, we can identify the total number of triangles present.

The triangles in a graph are formed by three nodes connected to each other. 

In this graph, the triangles can be formed by finding nodes that have edges connecting each other in all possible combinations.

Here are the triangles found in this graph:
<1, 3, 4>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<7, 2, 3>
<7, 4, 1>
<7, 6, 3>
<7, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
