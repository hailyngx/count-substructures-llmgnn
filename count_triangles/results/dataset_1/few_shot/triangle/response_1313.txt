Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8

Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go through the process step by step:

1. Look for triangles involving each node:
   - Node 0: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 7, 8> (2 triangles)
   - Node 1: <1, 0, 7>, <1, 6, 9> (2 triangles)
   - Node 2: No triangles
   - Node 3: No triangles
   - Node 4: No triangles
   - Node 5: <5, 6, 7> (1 triangle)
   - Node 6: <6, 1, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 9> (3 triangles)
   - Node 7: <7, 0, 5>, <7, 5, 6>, <7, 6, 8> (3 triangles)
   - Node 8: <8, 0, 2>, <8, 2, 6>, <8, 6, 7> (3 triangles)
   - Node 9: No triangles

2. Count the total number of triangles:
   Total number of triangles = 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 14

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 0, 5>, <7, 5, 6>, <7, 6, 8>, <8, 0, 2>, <8, 2, 6>, and <8, 6, 7>.
