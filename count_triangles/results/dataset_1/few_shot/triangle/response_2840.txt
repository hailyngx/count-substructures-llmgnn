Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 2>
<1, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 7> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [6].
