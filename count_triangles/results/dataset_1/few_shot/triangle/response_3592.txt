Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].  
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <1, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 9>.
