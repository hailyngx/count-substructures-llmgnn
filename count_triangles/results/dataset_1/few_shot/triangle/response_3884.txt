Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
