Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

Node 0: Connected to nodes 4 and 9
Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3
Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6

The triangles involving node 0 are:
- <0, 4, 1>
- <0, 4, 3>
- <0, 4, 9>

The triangles involving node 4 are:
- <4, 0, 3>
- <4, 1, 3>

The triangles involving node 9 are:
- <9, 0, 3>
- <9, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
