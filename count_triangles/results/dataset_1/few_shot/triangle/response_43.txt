Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
There are 3 triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [3].
