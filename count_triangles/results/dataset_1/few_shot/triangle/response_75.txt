Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1
