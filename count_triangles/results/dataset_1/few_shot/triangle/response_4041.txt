Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
