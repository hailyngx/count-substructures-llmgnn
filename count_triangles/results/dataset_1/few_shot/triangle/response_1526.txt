Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, and <3, 4, 9>.
