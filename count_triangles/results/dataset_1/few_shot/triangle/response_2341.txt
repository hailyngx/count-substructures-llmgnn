Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
