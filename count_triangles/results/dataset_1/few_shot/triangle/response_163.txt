Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
