Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be calculated by finding the number of triangles each node is part of. Since a triangle consists of 3 nodes and each node can be part of multiple triangles, we will calculate the number of triangles by counting the triangles that can be formed with each node.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
[<0, 1, 3>, <1, 2, 8>, <4, 5, 6>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is:
[3]
