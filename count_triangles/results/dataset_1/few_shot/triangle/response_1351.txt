Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's find out the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From the given information, we can identify the triangles formed by nodes:
   - Triangles involving node 0: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 8, 9>
   - Triangles involving node 1: <1, 2, 8>, <1, 8, 9>
   - Triangles involving node 2: <2, 3, 8>
   - Triangles involving node 3: <3, 4, 8>
   - Triangles involving node 6: <6, 8, 9>
   
2. Adding these unique triangles found, the total number of triangles in the graph is 7, which are:
   - <0, 3, 4>
   - <0, 3, 8>
   - <0, 4, 8>
   - <0, 8, 9>
   - <1, 2, 8>
   - <1, 8, 9>
   - <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
