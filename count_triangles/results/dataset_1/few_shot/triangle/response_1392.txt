Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph provided, we need to identify unique triangles formed by the given edges. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <1, 3, 7>
2. <1, 4, 7>
3. <1, 5, 7>
4. <2, 5, 7>
5. <3, 6, 7>
6. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
