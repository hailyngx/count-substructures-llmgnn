Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
