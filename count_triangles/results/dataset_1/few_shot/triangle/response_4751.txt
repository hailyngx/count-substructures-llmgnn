Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
Based on the given graph information, let's find the total number of triangles present in the graph:

1. To identify triangles, we need to look for nodes that have mutual connections. Let's examine each node:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
   - Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
   - Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
   - Node 7 is connected to node 0.
   - Node 8 is connected to node 5.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.

2. Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
   - The triangles in this graph are <1, 5, 9> and <1, 5, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
