Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
