Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].  
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>.
