Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0
