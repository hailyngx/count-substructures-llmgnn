Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
