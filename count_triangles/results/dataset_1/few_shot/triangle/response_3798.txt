Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
