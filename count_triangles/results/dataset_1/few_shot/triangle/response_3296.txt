Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
I will first list all the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 1>  (formed by edge (1, 4) and edge (4, 1))
3. Triangle <5, 0, 9>

Now, counting the total number of triangles, we have [2].
