Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0
