Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9

Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

In this graph, a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's find the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <1, 3, 6>
5. <1, 8, 9>
6. <3, 6, 8>
7. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
