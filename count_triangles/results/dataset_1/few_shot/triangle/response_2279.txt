Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
1. <0, 7, 9>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <2, 3, 8>
4. <2, 8, 9>
5. <7, 4, 9>
6. <8, 5, 0>

[Total number of triangles: 6]
