Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<8, 9, 0>
So, the total number of triangles is [6].
