Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8
