Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1
