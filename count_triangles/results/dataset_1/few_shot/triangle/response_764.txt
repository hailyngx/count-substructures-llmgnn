Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
