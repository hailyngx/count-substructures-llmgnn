Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

Given the edges, we can list the triangles in this graph:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 2, 3>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <0, 9, 4>
5. <1, 8, 5>
6. <3, 4, 9>
7. <3, 7, 5>
8. <4, 6, 9>
9. <7, 5, 8>

There are 9 triangles in total. Therefore, the number of triangles in this graph is [9].
