Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
