Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
