Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
