Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 3 and 4.
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 7.
3. Node 2 does not form any triangles.
4. Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 7.
5. Node 4 does not form any triangles.
6. Node 5 does not form any triangles.
7. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 9.
8. Node 7 forms triangles with nodes 3, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 does not form any triangles.
10. Node 9 does not form any triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>, and <3, 7, 8>.
