Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected.

Since node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 9, possible triangles involving node 0 are: 
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle 3: <0, 4, 7>

Similarly, for the other nodes, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle 4: <1, 2, 4>
- Triangle 5: <3, 2, 4>
- Triangle 6: <3, 7, 8>
- Triangle 7: <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle 8: <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle 9: <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
