Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is: [6]
The unique triangles found in this graph are: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 8, 4>.
