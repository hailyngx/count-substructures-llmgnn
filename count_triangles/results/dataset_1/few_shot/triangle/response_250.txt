Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
