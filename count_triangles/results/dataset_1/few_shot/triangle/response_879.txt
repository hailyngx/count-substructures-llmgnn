Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
