Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0
