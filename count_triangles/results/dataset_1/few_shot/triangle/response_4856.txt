Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7
