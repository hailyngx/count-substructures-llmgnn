Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
