Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 7: <0, 3, 7>.
2. Node 0 forms another triangle with nodes 7 and 8: <0, 7, 8>.
3. Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 2: <3, 0, 2>.
4. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 8: <4, 1, 8>.
5. Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 6: <7, 0, 6>.
6. Node 8 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 7: <8, 4, 7>.

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
