Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
