Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0
