Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 1>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 0>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 0>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 4>.
