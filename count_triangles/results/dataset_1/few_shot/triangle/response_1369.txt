Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
