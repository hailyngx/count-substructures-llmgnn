Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

From the given adjacency list, we can map out the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 2, and 5: <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle involving nodes 0, 5, and 6: <0, 5, 6>
3. Triangle involving nodes 0, 5, and 8: <0, 5, 8>
4. Triangle involving nodes 0, 5, and 9: <0, 5, 9>
5. Triangle involving nodes 0, 6, and 5: <0, 6, 5>
6. Triangle involving nodes 0, 6, and 7: <0, 6, 7>
7. Triangle involving nodes 0, 8, and 5: <0, 8, 5>
8. Triangle involving nodes 0, 9, and 5: <0, 9, 5>
9. Triangle involving nodes 0, 9, and 1: <0, 9, 1>
10. Triangle involving nodes 0, 2, and 3: <0, 2, 3>
11. Triangle involving nodes 0, 2, and 7: <0, 2, 7>
12. Triangle involving nodes 2, 7, and 1: <2, 7, 1>
13. Triangle involving nodes 2, 7, and 6: <2, 7, 6>
14. Triangle involving nodes 5, 9, and 1: <5, 9, 1>
15. Triangle involving nodes 5, 9, and 3: <5, 9, 3>
16. Triangle involving nodes 5, 9, and 4: <5, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
