Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
