Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in this graph are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, and <3, 7, 9>.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
