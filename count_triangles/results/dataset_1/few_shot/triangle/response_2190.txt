Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be formed by finding nodes that are connected to each other in a triangular manner. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle with nodes {0, 6, 9}
2. Triangle with nodes {0, 7, 9}
3. Triangle with nodes {0, 6, 7}
4. Triangle with nodes {1, 6, 8}
5. Triangle with nodes {8, 1, 3}
6. Triangle with nodes {8, 3, 4}
7. Triangle with nodes {6, 4, 8}
8. Triangle with nodes {6, 1, 8}
9. Triangle with nodes {0, 6, 1}
10. Triangle with nodes {0, 7, 8}
11. Triangle with nodes {7, 8, 9}
12. Triangle with nodes {4, 6, 8}

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12]. The unique triangles found are:
<0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 8, 3>, <3, 8, 4>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 8>.
