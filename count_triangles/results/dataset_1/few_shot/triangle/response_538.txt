Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5
