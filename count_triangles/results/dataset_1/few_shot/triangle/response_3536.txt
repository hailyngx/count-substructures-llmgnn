Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
