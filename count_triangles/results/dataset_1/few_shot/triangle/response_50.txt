Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles can be found by counting all unique triangles in the graph. Let's find them step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
4. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
5. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
6. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
7. Triangle <1, 3, 8>
8. Triangle <1, 8, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
