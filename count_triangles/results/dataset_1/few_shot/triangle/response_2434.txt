Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:

<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
