Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8
