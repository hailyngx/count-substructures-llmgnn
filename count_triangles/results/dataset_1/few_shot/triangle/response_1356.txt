Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 3.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9> 

So, the answer is [3].
