Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
1. <0, 4, 3>
2. <0, 4, 6> 

There are [2] triangles in total.
