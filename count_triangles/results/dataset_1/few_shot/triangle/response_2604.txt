Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given information, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. (0, 4, 5)
2. (0, 4, 7)
3. (0, 5, 9)
4. (4, 5, 9)
5. (6, 8, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, and <6, 8, 9>.
