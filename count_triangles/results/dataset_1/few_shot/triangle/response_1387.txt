Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph provided, we need to find all sets of three nodes that form a triangle by having edges between each pair of nodes.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <2, 7, 9>
- <2, 8, 3>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 9, 6>
- <7, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
