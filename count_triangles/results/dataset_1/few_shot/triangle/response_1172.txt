Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
[<1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>]
