Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to 0: 1, 3, 6, 8
   - <0, 1, 3> is a triangle.
   - <0, 1, 6> is a triangle.
   - <0, 3, 6> is a triangle.
   - <0, 1, 8> is not a triangle.
   - <0, 3, 8> is not a triangle.
   - <0, 6, 8> is not a triangle.

2. Nodes connected to 1: 0, 2
   - No triangles can be formed from node 1.

3. Nodes connected to 2: 1, 5, 6, 9
   - <2, 1, 5> is a triangle.
   - <2, 5, 6> is a triangle.
   - <2, 1, 6> is not a triangle.
   - <2, 1, 9> is not a triangle.
   - <2, 6, 9> is not a triangle.
   - <2, 5, 9> is not a triangle.

4. Nodes connected to 3: 0, 5
   - <3, 0, 5> is a triangle.

5. Nodes connected to 4: 5, 6
   - No triangles can be formed from node 4.

6. Nodes connected to 5: 2, 3, 4
   - <5, 2, 3> is a triangle.

7. Nodes connected to 6: 0, 2, 4
   - <6, 0, 4> is a triangle.
   - <6, 2, 4> is a triangle.

8. Nodes connected to 7: 9
   - No triangles can be formed from node 7.

9. Nodes connected to 8: 0, 9
   - <8, 0, 9> is a triangle.

10. Nodes connected to 9: 2, 7, 8
   - No additional triangles can be formed from node 9.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [10]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 0, 5>, <5, 2, 3>, <6, 0, 4>, and <6, 2, 4>.
