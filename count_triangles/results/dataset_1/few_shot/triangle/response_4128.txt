Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
