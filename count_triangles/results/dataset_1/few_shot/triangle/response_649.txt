Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
