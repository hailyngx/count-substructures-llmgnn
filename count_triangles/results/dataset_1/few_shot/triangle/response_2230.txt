Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
