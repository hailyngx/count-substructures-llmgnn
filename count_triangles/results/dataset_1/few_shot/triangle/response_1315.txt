Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
