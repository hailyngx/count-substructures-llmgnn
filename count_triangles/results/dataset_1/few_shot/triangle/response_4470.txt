Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are: 
<2, 1, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<6, 4, 3>

Therefore, the answer is [4].
