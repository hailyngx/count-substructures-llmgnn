Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
