Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
There are [3] triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
