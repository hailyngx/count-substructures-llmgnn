Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
