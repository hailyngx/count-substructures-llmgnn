Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8
