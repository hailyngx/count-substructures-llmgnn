Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
