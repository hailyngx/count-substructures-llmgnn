Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
