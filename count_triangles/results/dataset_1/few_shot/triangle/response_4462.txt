Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges.

The total number of triangles in the graph is 7.

Unique triangles in the graph:
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 4, 9>
<8, 4, 5> 

So, the output is [7].
