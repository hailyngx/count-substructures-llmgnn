Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
