Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
