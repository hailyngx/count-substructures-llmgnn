Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can go through each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After analyzing the given edges and adjacency list, the triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <4, 6, 9>
5. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
