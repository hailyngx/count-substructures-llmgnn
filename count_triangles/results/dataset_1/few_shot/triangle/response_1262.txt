Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
The triangle in a graph is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. From the given information, we can list down the nodes with mutual connections:
- Node 0, node 2, and node 4 form a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
- Node 2, node 4, and node 6 form a triangle <2, 4, 6>.
- Node 2, node 4, and node 7 form a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
- Node 2, node 5, and node 6 form a triangle <2, 5, 6>.
- Node 4, node 6, and node 7 form a triangle <4, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
