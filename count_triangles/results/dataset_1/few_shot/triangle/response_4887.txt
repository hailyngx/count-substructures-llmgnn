Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph. 
A triangle in a graph is formed when three nodes are connected to each other directly or indirectly.

Calculating the number of triangles:
- Notice that for a triangle to be formed, we need 3 nodes connected to each other.
- From the given graph, let's identify the unique triangles:

1. <2, 3, 4>
2. <2, 3, 8>
3. <2, 4, 8>
4. <3, 4, 6>
5. <3, 4, 8>
6. <4, 6, 8>

By listing the observed unique triangles, we have found 6 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
