Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
[<1, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 5>]
[2]
