Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
