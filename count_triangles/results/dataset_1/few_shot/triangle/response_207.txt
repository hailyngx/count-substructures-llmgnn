Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].  
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <0, 2, 6>, <5, 4, 9>.
