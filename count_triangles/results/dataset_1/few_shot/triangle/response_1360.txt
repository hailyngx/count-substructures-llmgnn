Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 9>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 5>

So, the total number of triangles is [5].
