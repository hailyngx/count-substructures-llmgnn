Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
There are a total of 13 triangles in the graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 9, 5>
<2, 9, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 1, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
