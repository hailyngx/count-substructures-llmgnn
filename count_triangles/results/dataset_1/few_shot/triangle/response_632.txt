Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
Based on the provided graph, let's calculate the number of triangles and list them:

Number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found in the graph: 
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
