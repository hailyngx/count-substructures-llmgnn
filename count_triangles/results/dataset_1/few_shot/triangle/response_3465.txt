Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [4].
