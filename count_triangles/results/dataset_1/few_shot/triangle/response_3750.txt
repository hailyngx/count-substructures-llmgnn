Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Following the given graph, let's determine the number of triangles it contains:

1. From the provided edge list, we can see that the nodes involved in a triangle are (0, 2, 7) and (1, 2, 4).
2. As we list the triangles found:
   <0, 2, 7>
   <1, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
