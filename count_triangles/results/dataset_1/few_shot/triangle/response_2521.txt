Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
