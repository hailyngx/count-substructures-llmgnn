Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6

Response:
[<0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 4>, <1, 0, 9>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 9, 6>, <4, 2, 9>, <4, 5, 0>, <5, 0, 4>, <6, 3, 9>, <6, 8, 1>, <6, 9, 0>]
