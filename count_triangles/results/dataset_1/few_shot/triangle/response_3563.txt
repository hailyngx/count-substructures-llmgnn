Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
