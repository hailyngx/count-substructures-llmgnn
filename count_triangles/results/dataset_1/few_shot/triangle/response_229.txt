Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
