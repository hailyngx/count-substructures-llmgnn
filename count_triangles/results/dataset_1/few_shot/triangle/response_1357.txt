Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
