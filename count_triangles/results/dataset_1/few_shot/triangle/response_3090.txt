Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4
