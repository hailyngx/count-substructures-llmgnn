Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by identifying unique triangles formed by three connected nodes.

1. Possible triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 2>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle 3: <2, 4, 6>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
