Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has a total of 3 triangles.
The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
