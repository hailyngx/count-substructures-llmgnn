Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
