Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
