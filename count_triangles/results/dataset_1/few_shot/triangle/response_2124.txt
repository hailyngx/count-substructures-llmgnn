Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0
