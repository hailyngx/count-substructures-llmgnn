Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all pairwise connected. Each triangle consists of three vertices connected by edges to form a closed loop.

Given the adjacency list of the graph, we can visualize the triangles by examining each set of three nodes that form a closed loop of edges. Let's identify the triangles:

- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle 3: <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle 4: <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle 5: <0, 7, 5>
- Triangle 6: <2, 1, 3>
- Triangle 7: <2, 1, 5>
- Triangle 8: <2, 1, 7>
- Triangle 9: <2, 3, 8>
- Triangle 10: <2, 6, 4>
- Triangle 11: <2, 8, 4>
- Triangle 12: <6, 4, 8>
- Triangle 13: <7, 0, 5>
- Triangle 14: <8, 3, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
