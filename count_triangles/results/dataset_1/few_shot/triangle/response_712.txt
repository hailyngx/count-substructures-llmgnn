Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles by looking at nodes that form triangles when connected. 

Nodes forming triangles:
1. Triangles involving node 0: 
<0, 5, 8>

2. Triangles involving node 2: 
<2, 3, 4>

3. Triangles involving node 3: 
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 8>

4. Triangles involving node 8: 
<0, 8, 5>
<6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
