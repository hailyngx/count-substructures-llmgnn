Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. Let's now calculate the total number of triangles in this graph.

To find a triangle in a graph, we need to see if there is a cycle of length 3 through a path of length 2. In this graph, a triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Looking at the given graph, we can list the triangles as follows:
1. <0, 2, 1>
2. <0, 2, 3>
3. <0, 3, 5>
4. <0, 6, 5>
5. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
