Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
