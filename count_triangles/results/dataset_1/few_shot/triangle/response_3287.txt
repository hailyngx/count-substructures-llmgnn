Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
