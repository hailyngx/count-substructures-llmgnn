Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
