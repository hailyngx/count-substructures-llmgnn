Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
The graph described is as follows:

```
    1       3       7
     \     /        
      0---8       6
     /|\ /|\      
    / | X | \     
   /  |/ \|  \    
  4---9   2---5
```

To find the number of triangles in this graph:
1. We will identify all unique triangles formed by connecting 3 nodes.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.
3. Present the answer.

Let's calculate the number of triangles.
