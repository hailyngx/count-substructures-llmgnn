Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
