Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
