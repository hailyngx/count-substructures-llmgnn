Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated as follows:

1. Identify possible triangles involving each node:
- Node 0: None
- Node 1: None
- Node 2: None
- Node 3: None
- Node 4: None
- Node 5: <1, 2, 8>
- Node 6: None
- Node 7: None
- Node 8: <1, 5, 8>
- Node 9: None

2. Combine the unique triangles found:
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
