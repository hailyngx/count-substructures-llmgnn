Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
