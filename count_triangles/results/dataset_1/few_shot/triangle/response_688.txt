Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
