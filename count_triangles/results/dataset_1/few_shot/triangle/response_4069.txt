Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
There are total of 10 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 3> 

So, the total number of triangles is [10].
