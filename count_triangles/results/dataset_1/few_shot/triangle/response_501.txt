Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7
