Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
