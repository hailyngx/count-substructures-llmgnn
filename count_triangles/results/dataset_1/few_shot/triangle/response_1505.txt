Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
