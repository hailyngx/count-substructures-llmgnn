Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
