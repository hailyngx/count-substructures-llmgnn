Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 8, 6>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<4, 7, 1>
<4, 7, 0>
<8, 0, 9>
<5, 3, 1>
<5, 3, 9>
<2, 9, 0>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
