Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in this given graph is [4].  
The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, and <0, 2, 6>.
