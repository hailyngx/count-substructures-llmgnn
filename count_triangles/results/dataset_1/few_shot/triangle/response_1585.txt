Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0
