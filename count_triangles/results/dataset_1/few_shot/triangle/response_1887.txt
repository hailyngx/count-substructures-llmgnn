Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
