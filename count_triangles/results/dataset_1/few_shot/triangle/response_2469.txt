Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
