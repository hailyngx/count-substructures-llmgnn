Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
