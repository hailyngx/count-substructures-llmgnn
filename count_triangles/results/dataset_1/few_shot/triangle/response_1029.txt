Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
Given the graph, we can identify the triangles formed by checking nodes that are connected to each other.

Nodes that form a triangle:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 2>
4. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
5. Triangle <3, 2, 8>
6. Triangle <3, 5, 4>
7. Triangle <5, 1, 3>
8. Triangle <5, 1, 6>
9. Triangle <5, 3, 6>
10. Triangle <8, 2, 0>
11. Triangle <9, 0, 4>

There are 11 triangles in total.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
