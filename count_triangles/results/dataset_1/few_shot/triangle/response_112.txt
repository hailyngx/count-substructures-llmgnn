Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by finding the number of triangles each node is a part of and adding them up.

Calculating for each node:
- Node 0: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 7> (2 triangles)
- Node 1: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 7> (2 triangles)
- Node 2: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 7> (2 triangles)
- Node 3: Not part of any triangle
- Node 4: Not part of any triangle
- Node 5: Not part of any triangle
- Node 6: Not part of any triangle
- Node 7: <0, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 7> (4 triangles)
- Node 8: Not part of any triangle
- Node 9: Not part of any triangle

Adding up the total number of triangles: 2 (from node 0) + 2 (from node 1) + 2 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 7) = 10 triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
