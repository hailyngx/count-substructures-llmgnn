Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 7, 3>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <2, 8, 4>
6. Triangle <8, 4, 9>
7. Triangle <8, 9, 6>

Total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
