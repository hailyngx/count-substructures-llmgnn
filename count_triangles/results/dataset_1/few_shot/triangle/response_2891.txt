Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find the number of triangles it contains.

1. Look for triangles by determining nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular manner:
   - For example, for nodes 0, 2, and 5 to form a triangle, we need edges (0,2), (0,5), and (2,5) to exist.
   - Similarly, we can check for other potential triangles in the graph.

2. Identify the triangles found:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
   - Triangle 2: <1, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 3: <3, 4, 9>
   - Triangle 4: <5, 8, 9>

3. Calculate the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 4

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
