This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Triangle counting using the adjacency list:
- <0, 5, 7>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <5, 7, 9>

2. Count the number of unique triangles:
There are 7 unique triangles found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
