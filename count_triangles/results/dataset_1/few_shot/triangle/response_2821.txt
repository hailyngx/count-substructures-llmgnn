Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three vertices that form triangles. To achieve this, we can follow these steps:

1. Consider each vertex as a potential starting point of a triangle.
2. Check all pairs of neighbors of the selected vertex to find triangles.

Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph:

<1, 6, 4>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 7, 2>
<4, 6, 7>
