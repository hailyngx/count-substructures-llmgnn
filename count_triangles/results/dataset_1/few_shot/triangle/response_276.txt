Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
Based on the given graph and adjacency list, we can calculate the number of triangles in the graph.

- Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 8: <0, 3, 8>
- Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 9: <1, 7, 9>
- Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 2: <0, 2, 3>
- Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 8 and 9: <5, 8, 9>
- Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 9: <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. 
The answer is [5].
