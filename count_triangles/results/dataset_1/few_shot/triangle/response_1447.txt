Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
