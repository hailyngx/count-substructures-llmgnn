Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given graph, the triangles can be found by identifying sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The unique triangles in this graph are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
