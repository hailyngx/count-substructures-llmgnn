Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify triangles:
- A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. 
- Each triangle has three edges.

2. Count triangles in the graph:
- From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
    - Triangle 1: <2, 4, 9>
    - Triangle 2: <2, 5, 9>

3. Output the result:
- The total number of triangles in the graph is 2, and they are <2, 4, 9> and <2, 5, 9>.
  
Therefore, the output is:
