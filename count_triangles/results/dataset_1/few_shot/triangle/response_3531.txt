Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: 
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [3].
