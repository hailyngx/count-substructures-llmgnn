Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Using the adjacency list provided, we can find the number of triangles in the graph.

Node 1 has edges to nodes 2, 6, and 7. To form a triangle, we look for nodes that are connected to both pairs of these nodes. Nodes 2 and 6 are connected by node 1, so there is a triangle <1, 2, 6>. Similarly, nodes 2 and 7 are connected by node 1, creating another triangle <1, 2, 7>.

Hence, the total number of triangles is [2].
