Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2
