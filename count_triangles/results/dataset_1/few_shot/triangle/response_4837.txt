Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
