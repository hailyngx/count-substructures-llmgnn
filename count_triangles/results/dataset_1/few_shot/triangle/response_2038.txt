Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].  
Unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 0>, <5, 7, 8>, <4, 2, 5>.
