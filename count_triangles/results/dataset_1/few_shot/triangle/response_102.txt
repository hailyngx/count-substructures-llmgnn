Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: 

[<0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 9>] 

There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
