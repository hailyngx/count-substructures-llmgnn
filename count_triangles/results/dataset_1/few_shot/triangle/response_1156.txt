Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle. In this case, we observe that the triangles are formed by nodes (0, 2, 8), (0, 3, 8), and (0, 3, 9). Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
