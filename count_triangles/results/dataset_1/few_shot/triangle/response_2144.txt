Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <2, 3, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
