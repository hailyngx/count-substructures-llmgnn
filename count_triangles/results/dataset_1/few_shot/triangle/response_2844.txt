Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
