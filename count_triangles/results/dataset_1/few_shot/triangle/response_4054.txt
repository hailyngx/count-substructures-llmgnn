Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
There are <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 5>, <5, 7, 8>, and <6, 7, 5> triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
