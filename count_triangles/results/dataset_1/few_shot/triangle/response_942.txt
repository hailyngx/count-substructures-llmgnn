Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
[<3, 4, 7>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
