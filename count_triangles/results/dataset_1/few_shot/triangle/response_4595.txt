Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <1, 4, 7>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <1, 6, 9>
4. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are total [4] triangles in the given graph.
