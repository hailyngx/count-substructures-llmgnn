Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
