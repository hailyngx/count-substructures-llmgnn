Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
