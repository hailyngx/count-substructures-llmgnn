Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's look at the adjacency list of each node to identify the triangles.

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 7 and 9
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2 and 7
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 3: Connected to node 8
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 2 and 6
- Node 5: Connected to node 6
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8

Let's identify the triangles:
- Triangles involving Node 0: None
- Triangles involving Node 1: None
- Triangles involving Node 2: <2, 6, 9>
- Triangles involving Node 3: None
- Triangles involving Node 4: None
- Triangles involving Node 5: None
- Triangles involving Node 6: <2, 4, 9>
- Triangles involving Node 7: None
- Triangles involving Node 8: None
- Triangles involving Node 9: None

Total number of triangles in the graph: [2]
Unique triangles found: <2, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 9>
