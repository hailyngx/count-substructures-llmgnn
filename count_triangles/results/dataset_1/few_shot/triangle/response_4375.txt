Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by 3 connected nodes. Since the graph is undirected, we will consider each triangle only once.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 6, 2>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 4, 2>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
