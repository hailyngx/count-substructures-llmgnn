Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
