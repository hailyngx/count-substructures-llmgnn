Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
