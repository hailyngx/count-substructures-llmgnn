Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has a total of 10 nodes and 28 edges.

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Checking all possible triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 2>
3. Triangle <0, 7, 2>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 1>
5. Triangle <2, 7, 0>
6. Triangle <5, 1, 8>
7. Triangle <6, 9, 8>

So, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
