Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by nodes that are mutually connected. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. From the given edges:
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5>
   - Triangle <3, 7, 9>

2. Now, let's check triangles formed using adjacent nodes:
   - Node 0 is adjacent to nodes 2 and 5, forming triangle <0, 2, 5> (already counted)
   - Node 1 has no triangles with its adjacent nodes.
   - Node 2 is adjacent to nodes 0 and 7, but the triangle with these nodes is already counted.
   - Node 3 is adjacent to nodes 6, 7, and 9, forming triangle <3, 6, 9>.
   - Node 4 has no triangles with its adjacent nodes.
   - Node 5 has no triangles with its adjacent nodes.
   - Node 6 is adjacent to nodes 1 and 3, forming triangle <1, 3, 6>.
   - Node 7 is adjacent to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9, but all triangles have been counted.
   - Node 8 is not connected to any node.
   - Node 9 is adjacent to nodes 3 and 7, but the triangle with these nodes has already been counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5> and <3, 6, 9>.
