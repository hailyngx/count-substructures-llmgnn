Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 9, 1>
<0, 9, 2>

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in total.
