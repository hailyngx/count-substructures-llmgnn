Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3
