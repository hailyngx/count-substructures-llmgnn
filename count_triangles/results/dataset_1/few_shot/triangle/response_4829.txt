Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to count all unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. 

From the provided adjacency list, we can identify these triangles:

1. <1, 5, 9>
2. <2, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
