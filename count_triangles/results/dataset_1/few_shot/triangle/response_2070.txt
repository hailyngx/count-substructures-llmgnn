Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
The unique triangles are: <0, 3, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <0, 1, 6>.
