Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
