Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8
