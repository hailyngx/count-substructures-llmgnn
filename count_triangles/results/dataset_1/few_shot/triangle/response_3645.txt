Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8
