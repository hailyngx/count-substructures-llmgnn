Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <2, 3, 9>
5. <2, 4, 9>
6. <2, 6, 7>
7. <3, 4, 9>
8. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
