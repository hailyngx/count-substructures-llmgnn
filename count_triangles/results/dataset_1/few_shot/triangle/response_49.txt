Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other in groups of three.
2. List the triangles found.
3. Count the total number of unique triangles.

By examining the given edges and the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following unique triangles:
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
