Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 9, 8>
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
