Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are interconnected with each other.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <2, 4, 7>
6. <2, 5, 7>
7. <2, 8, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
