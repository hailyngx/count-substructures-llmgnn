Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
