Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
