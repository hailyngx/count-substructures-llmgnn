Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
