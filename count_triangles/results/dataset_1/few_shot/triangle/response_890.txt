Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
