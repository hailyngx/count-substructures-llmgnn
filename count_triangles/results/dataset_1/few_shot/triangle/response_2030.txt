Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
