Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
