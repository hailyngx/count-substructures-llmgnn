Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
The graph described can be represented as follows:
```
        0 -- 4
       /|\   |\
      / | \  | \
     5 -- 6  7  9
      \ |   /|
       \|  / |
         2 -- 1
          |
          8
```

Let's count the number of triangles in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 4, 5, and 6
- Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 0, 4, and 6
- Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 0, 5, and 7
- Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 0, 5, and 6

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, and <5, 6, 7>.
