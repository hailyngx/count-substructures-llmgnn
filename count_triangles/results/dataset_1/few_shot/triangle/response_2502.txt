Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
