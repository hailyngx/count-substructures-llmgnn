Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by nodes that are mutually connected to each other. Let's find the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
 - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
 - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8.
 - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.
 
2. There are no other triangles in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
