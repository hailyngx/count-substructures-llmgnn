Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
