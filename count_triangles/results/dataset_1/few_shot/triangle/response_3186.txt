Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by nodes that are connected with each other. To count the number of triangles, we can follow these steps:

1. Look for nodes that have common neighbors. These nodes form a triangle.
2. Count the number of such triangles.

By examining the given information, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
