Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 7>, 
<0, 3, 9>, 
<0, 4, 9>, 
<0, 5, 2>, 
<0, 5, 9>, 
<0, 9, 2>, 
<0, 9, 4>, 
<1, 7, 8>, 
<2, 3, 9>, 
<2, 5, 0>, 
<3, 4, 9>, 
<3, 8, 9>, 
<4, 9, 6>  

So, the total number of triangles is [13].
