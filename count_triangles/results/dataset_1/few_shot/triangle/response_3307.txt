Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, and <5, 7, 9>.
