Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
