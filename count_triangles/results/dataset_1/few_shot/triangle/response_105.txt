Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
