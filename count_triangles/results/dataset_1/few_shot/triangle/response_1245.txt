Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph:

From the given edges and adjacency list, we can visualize the connections between nodes as follows:
- Nodes 0, 2, and 5 form a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
- Nodes 3, 7, and 8 form a triangle <3, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
