Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
Following the given information and edges provided, we can identify the triangles in the graph. Triangles in a graph are formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

The triangles in this graph are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <2, 3, 9>
5. <2, 4, 5>
6. <2, 8, 9>
7. <4, 5, 2>
8. <7, 9, 3>
9. <8, 1, 0>
  
Hence, the total number of triangles in this graph is [9].
