Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 1, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>.
