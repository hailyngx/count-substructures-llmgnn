Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
The total number of triangles is [2]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, and <4, 5, 6>.
