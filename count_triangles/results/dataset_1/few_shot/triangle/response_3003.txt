Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
