Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
