Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7
