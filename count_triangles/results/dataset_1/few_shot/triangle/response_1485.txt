Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
