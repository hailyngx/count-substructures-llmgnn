Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
The triangle in a graph consists of three nodes connected to each other, forming a closed loop. To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can consider the triangles formed by each node and its adjacent nodes.

After analyzing the given graph's structure, the triangles in the graph are:
1. <2, 0, 3>
2. <2, 1, 3>
3. <3, 1, 9>
4. <3, 6, 4>
5. <3, 7, 9>
6. <2, 5, 8>
7. <9, 4, 6>
8. <9, 7, 8>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
