Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by identifying which nodes form triangles in the graph. To do this, we will check each set of three nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Node pairs that are connected by an edge:
- (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 9)
- (1, 2), (1, 8)
- (2, 1), (2, 9)
- (3, 8)
- (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)
- (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)
- (6, 4), (6, 5)
- (7, 4), (7, 5)
- (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)
- (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 4)

We can then list the unique triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
