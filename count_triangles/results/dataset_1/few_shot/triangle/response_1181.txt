Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6
