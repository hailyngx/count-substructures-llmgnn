Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4
