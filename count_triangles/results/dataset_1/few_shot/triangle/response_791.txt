Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
