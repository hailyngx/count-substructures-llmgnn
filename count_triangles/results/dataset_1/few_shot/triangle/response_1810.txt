Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
