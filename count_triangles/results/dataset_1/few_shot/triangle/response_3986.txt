Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<2, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<0, 5, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
