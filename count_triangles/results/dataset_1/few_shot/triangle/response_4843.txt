Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
