Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
