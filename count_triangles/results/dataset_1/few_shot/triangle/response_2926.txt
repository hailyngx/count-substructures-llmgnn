Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
[
<2, 8, 4>, 
<3, 5, 7>
] [2]
