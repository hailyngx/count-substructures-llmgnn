Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Here are the unique triangles present in the graph:
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
  
So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
