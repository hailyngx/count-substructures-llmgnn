Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph to find the total number of triangles.

The triangles can be found by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a way that forms a triangle.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 7>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
