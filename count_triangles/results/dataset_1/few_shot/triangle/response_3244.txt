Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by finding the complete subgraphs of size 3. We look for nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <4, 6, 7>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
