Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, and <3, 5, 9>.
