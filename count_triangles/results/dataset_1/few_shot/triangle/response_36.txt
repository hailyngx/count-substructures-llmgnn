Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
