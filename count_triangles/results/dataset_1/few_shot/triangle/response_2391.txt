Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

- Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that to form a triangle we need three nodes that are all connected to each other.

- We can find triangles by looking at each node and checking if there are any pairs of connected nodes that are also connected to each other.

After analyzing the graph, we find the following triangles:

<0, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
