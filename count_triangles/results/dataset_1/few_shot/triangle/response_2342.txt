Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
