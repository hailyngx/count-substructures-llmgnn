Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 4. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 4>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<4, 7, 6> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
