Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
