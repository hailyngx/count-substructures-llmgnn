Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
