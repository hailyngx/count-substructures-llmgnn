Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. 

The triangles are formed by cycles of length 3. We will look for nodes that form a cycle by following the edges. Let's list the unique triangles below:

<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 2>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 unique triangles in the given graph.

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
