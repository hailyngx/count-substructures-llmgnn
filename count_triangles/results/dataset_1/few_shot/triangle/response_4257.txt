Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <0, 7, 9>
6. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
7. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
8. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
9. Triangle <8, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
