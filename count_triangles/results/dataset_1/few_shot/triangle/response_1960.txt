Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
