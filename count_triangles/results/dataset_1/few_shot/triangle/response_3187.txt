Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <1, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [5].
