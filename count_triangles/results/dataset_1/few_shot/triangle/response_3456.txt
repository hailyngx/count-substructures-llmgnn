Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

To find a triangle, we look for a cycle of length 3, which means three nodes are connected in a closed loop.

Based on the given edges and adjacency list, we can identify the following unique triangles:
1. <1, 3, 8>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <1, 8, 9>
4. <3, 6, 9>
5. <4, 6, 9>
6. <5, 1, 8>
7. <9, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
