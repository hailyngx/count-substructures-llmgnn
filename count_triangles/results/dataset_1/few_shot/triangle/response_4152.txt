Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3)
