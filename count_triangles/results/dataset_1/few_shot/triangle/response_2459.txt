Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4

Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible triangles formed by the nodes in the graph based on the given edges and connectivity information. Let's calculate this step-by-step.

1. Identify the triangles:
   - Iterate over all possible combinations of three nodes (0 to 9).
   - Check if there exists an edge between each pair of nodes in the combination to form a triangle.

2. Count the triangles:
   - After identifying all triangles, count the total number of unique triangles.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
