Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in the graph are:
[<1, 4, 8> <1, 7, 9>]

There are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
