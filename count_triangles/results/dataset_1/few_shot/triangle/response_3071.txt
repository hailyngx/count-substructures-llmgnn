Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
