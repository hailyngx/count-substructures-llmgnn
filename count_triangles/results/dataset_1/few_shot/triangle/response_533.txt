Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
