Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 8, 5>
<2, 8, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
