Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
