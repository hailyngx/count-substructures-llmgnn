Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Identify the triangles:
   - For each edge (u, v), check for a common neighbor w such that there is an edge between u and w as well as an edge between v and w. This forms a triangle.
   
2. List the unique triangles found:
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <0, 4, 9>
   - <0, 7, 4>
   - <0, 8, 9>
   - <2, 4, 9>
   - <4, 5, 9>
   - <4, 6, 9>
   - <7, 3, 4>
   - <8, 0, 9>

3. Count the total number of triangles:
   - There are 9 unique triangles identified.
   - Hence, the total number of triangles is [9].
