Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
