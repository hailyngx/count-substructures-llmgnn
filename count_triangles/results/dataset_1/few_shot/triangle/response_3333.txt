Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
