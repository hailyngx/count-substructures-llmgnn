Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3
