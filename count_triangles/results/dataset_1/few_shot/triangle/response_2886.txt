Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 6
