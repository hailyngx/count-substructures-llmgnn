Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
