Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6
