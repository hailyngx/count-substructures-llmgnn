Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
From the given graph information, we can identify the triangles by looking for nodes that have edges connecting each other forming a closed loop. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here are the triangles in the given graph:
1. <2, 7, 9>
2. <3, 7, 9>
3. <6, 7, 9>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
