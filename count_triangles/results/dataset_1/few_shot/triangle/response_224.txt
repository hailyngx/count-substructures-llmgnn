Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has the following edges and adjacency list: 
- Edges: 
  (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

- Adjacency List: 
  Node 0: 9
  Node 1: 4, 5, 8
  Node 2: 9
  Node 3: 4, 5
  Node 4: 1, 3
  Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 8
  Node 6: 5
  Node 7: - (Not connected)
  Node 8: 1, 5, 9
  Node 9: 0, 2, 8

Now, let's find the number of triangles in this graph: [<0, 9, 8>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 3>, <4, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 9>]
There are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
