Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
[Total number of triangles: 2]
