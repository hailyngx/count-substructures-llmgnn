Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
In order to count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's go through the graph and identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 4>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
