Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are: <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 1>, <4, 9, 8>, <3, 9, 8>.
