Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
