Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
