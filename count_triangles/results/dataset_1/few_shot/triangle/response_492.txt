Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
There are [14] triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are: <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 1, 7>, <4, 3, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <3, 6, 8>.
