Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 8, 5>, <5, 6, 9>.
