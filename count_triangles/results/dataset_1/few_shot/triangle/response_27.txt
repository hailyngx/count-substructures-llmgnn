Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
