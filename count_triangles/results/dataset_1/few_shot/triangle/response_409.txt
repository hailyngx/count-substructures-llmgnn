Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
