Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph. 

To find the triangles, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all pairwise connected to each other. 

Looking at the adjacency list and given edges, we can see the following triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 7>, <2, 8, 9>, and <2, 6, 9>.
