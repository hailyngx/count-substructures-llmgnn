Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
