Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
