Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <1, 5, 0>
2. <1, 9, 4>
3. <1, 7, 9>
4. <1, 7, 8>
5. <1, 6, 2>
6. <1, 6, 3>
7. <6, 3, 8>
8. <8, 3, 0>
9. <8, 3, 9>
10. <8, 9, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
