Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 1, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, and <3, 8, 9>.
