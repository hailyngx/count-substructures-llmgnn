Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
The given graph can be represented as shown below:

```
    1 -- 2
    |     |
    7 -- 6 - 4
    |  \  | / |
    0    8 - 5
     \    \
        3 -- 9
```

To find the total number of triangles in the graph:
1. Identify the triangles formed by nodes.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

The triangles in the above graph are <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, and <4, 6, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
