Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Find triangles where each node is connected to every other node in the triangle:
    - There are no triangles where each node is connected to every other node directly.

2. Find triangles where each node is connected to exactly two other nodes in the triangle:
    - Triangle <1, 3, 2>
    - Triangle <1, 8, 7>
    - Triangle <1, 3, 5>
    - Triangle <2, 3, 5>
    - Triangle <2, 7, 8>
    - Triangle <3, 5, 2>
    - Triangle <7, 8, 2>
    - Triangle <3, 2, 7>
    - Triangle <3, 2, 9>
    - Triangle <2, 9, 4>
    - Triangle <2, 7, 8>
    - Triangle <7, 8, 1>
    - Triangle <8, 1, 3>
    
3. Total number of triangles: [13]
