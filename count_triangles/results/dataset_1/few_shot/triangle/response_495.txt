Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 8, 9> and <3, 8, 9>.
