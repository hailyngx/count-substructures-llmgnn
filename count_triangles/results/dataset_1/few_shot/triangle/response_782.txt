Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, we can identify the triangles in the graph by looking at sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected to each other.

After examining the graph, we can see that there are two triangles in this graph: <1, 3, 4> and <5, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
