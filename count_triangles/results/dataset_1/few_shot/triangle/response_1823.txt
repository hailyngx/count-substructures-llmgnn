Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
The triangles in a graph are formed by 3 nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the triangles in this graph step by step:

1. For each node, find its neighbors and check if there are any triangles.
   
   - Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 5, and 9. No triangles.
   - Node 2: Neighbors are 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8. Possible triangles: <2, 3, 6>.
   - Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 2, 6, and 9. Possible triangles: <1, 3, 9>.
   - Node 4: Neighbor is 2. No triangles.
   - Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 2, 6, and 7. Possible triangles: <1, 5, 6>.
   - Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 3, and 5. No triangles.
   - Node 7: Neighbors are 5 and 8. No triangles.
   - Node 8: Neighbors are 2 and 7. No triangles.
   - Node 9: Neighbors are 1 and 3. No triangles.

2. Count the triangles found above and total them up. 

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <2, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, and <1, 5, 6>.
