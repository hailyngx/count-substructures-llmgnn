Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7
