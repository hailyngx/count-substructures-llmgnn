Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
