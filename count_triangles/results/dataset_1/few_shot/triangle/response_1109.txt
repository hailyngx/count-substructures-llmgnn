Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
<0, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
