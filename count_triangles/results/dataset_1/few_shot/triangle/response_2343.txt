Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
