Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 2.

Unique triangles found in the graph:
<3, 4, 8>
<7, 8, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
