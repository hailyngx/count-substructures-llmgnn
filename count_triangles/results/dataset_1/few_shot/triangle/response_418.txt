Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
