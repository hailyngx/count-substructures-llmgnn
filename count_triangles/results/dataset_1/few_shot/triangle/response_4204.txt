Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 4.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8> 

So, there are [4] triangles in total.
