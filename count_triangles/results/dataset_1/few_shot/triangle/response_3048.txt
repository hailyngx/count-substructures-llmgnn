Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
