Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3
