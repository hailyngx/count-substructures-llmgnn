Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, and <2, 9, 7>.
