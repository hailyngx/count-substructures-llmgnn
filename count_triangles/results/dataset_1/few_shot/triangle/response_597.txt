Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0
