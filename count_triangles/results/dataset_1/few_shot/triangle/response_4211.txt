Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
