Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Let's first list out all the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 7>

Now let's count the total number of triangles inside brackets []:
