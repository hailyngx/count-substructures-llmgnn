Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 9>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
