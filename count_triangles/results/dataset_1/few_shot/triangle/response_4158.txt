Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
There are 3 triangles present in the given graph. 
The triangles are: 
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
