Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
