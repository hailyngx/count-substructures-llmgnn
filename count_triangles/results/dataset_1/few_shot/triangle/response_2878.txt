Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
The triangles in this graph are <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 2>, and <6, 4, 8>. 

So, the total number of triangles is [3].
