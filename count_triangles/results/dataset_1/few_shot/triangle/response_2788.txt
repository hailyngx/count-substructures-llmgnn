Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, and <0, 8, 9>.
