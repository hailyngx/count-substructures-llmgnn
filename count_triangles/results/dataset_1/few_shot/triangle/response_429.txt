Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<1, 3, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 7>

So, the total number of triangles is [8].
