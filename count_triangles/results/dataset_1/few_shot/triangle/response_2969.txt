Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
