Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be found by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular fashion. 
Using the adjacency list to identify triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 3>
- Triangle <1, 3, 9>
- Triangle <1, 6, 2>
- Triangle <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle <2, 5, 8>
- Triangle <2, 6, 1>
- Triangle <2, 7, 3>
- Triangle <4, 5, 9> 
- Triangle <8, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. 
So, the output should be: 
[9]
