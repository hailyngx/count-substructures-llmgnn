Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: <0, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, and <7, 8, 9>. 

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
