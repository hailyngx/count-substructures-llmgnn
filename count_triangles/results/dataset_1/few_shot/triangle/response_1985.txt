Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To find the number of triangles in a graph, we look for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's count the triangles step-by-step:

1. For each node, consider all possible triangles it can form with its neighbors. 
2. Check if any of these triangles actually exist in the graph based on the given edges.

Let's go through the nodes to find the triangles:

- Node 0: <0, 2, 8> [Triangle 1]
- Node 1: No triangles can be formed.
- Node 2: No additional triangles can be formed.
- Node 3: No triangles can be formed.
- Node 4: <1, 2, 6> [Triangle 2]
- Node 5: No additional triangles can be formed.
- Node 6: No additional triangles can be formed.
- Node 7: No triangles can be formed.
- Node 8: No additional triangles can be formed.
- Node 9: No connections, so no triangles can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8> and <1, 2, 6>.
