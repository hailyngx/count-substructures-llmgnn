Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5
