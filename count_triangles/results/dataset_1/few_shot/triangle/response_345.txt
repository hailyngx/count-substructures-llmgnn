Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].

The unique triangle found is <0, 3, 8>.
