Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's list all the triangles:
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 1, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 9, 5>
<6, 1, 9>
<6, 3, 9>
<9, 4, 5>
<9, 5, 6>

Now, counting the total number of triangles: 
Total number of triangles = 9

Therefore, the answer is: [9].
