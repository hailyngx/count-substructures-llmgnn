Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
