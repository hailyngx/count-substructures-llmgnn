Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
