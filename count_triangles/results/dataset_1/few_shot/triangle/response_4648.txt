Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by cycles of length 3. To identify the triangles, we can examine each node and find if there are any two nodes connected to it that are also connected to each other. This scenario forms a triangle.

Let's list the unique triangles found:
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 7>

Counting the total number of triangles: [5]
