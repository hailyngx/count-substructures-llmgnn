Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: 
[4]  

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in total in this graph.
