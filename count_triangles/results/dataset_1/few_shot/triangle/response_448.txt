Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
