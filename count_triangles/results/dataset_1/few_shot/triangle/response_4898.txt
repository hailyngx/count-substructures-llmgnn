Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 6, 0>
<0, 7, 0>
<0, 8, 0>
<0, 9, 0>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 9, 4>
<0, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
