Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
