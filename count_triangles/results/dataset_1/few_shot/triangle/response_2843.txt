Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
By examining the given graph, we can determine the total number of triangles and identify them. 
Here is how we can go about it:

- Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 3, 8: <0, 3, 8>
- Node 1 forms no triangles as there are no nodes adjacent to both nodes 1 and another node adjacent to both.
- Node 2 forms no triangles as there are no nodes adjacent to both nodes 2 and another node adjacent to both.
- Node 3 forms no new triangles as we have already counted the triangle involving node 0.
- Node 4 forms no triangles as there are no nodes adjacent to both nodes 4 and another node adjacent to both.
- Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 2, 6: <2, 5, 6> and a triangle with nodes 3, 6: <3, 5, 6>
- Node 6 forms no new triangles as all triangles involving node 6 have already been counted.
- Node 7 forms no new triangles as we have already counted triangles involving nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 forms no new triangles as we have already counted the triangle involving node 0.
- Node 9 forms no new triangles as there are no nodes adjacent to both nodes 9 and another node adjacent to both.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 4, and they are: 
<0, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 6>. 

Therefore, the answer is [4].
