Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
