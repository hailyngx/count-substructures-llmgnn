Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given graph, there are 3 triangles present. 

[Total number of triangles: 3]

Unique triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <0, 5, 8>
