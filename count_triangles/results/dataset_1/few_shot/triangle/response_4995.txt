Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given graph and adjacency list, we can calculate the number of triangles in the graph.

A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other with edges, forming a closed loop. To find triangles efficiently, we can check each node's neighbors and see if there are any two neighbors that are connected to each other.

The triangles in the given graph are:
- <0, 2, 9>
- <2, 5, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
