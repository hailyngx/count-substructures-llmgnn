Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, and <5, 6, 9>.
