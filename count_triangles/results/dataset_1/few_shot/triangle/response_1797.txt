Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: 

<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 8, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 4]
