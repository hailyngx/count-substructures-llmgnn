Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
