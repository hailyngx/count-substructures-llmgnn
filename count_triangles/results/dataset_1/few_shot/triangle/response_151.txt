Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
