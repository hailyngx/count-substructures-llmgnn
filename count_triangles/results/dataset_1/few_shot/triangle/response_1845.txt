Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by looking at how many triangles are formed by each node. 

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 9, 5>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 3>
<5, 9, 1>
<6, 9, 0>
<7, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
