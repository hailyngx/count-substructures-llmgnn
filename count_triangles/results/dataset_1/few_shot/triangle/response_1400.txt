Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
