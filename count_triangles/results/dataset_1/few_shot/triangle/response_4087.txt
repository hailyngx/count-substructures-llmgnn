Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
