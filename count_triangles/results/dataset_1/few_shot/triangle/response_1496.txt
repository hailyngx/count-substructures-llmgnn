Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by nodes that are all connected to each other. Based on the given information, we can identify the following unique triangles:

<0, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the graph.
