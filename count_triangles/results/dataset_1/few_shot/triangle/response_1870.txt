Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6
