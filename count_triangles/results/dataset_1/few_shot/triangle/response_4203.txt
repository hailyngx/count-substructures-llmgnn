Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

So, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
