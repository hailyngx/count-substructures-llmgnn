Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

We have the following triangles:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<7, 6, 8>

Count of triangles: [4]
