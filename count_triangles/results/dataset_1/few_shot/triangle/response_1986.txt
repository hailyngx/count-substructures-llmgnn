Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
