Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles that exist in this graph:

Triangles:
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:
