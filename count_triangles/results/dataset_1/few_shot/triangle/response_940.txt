Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8
