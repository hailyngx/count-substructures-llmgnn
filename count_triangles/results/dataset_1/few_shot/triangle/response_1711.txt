Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 5, 1>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <2, 0, 5>
6. <2, 6, 1>
7. <2, 7, 1>
8. <4, 8, 6>
9. <5, 0, 1>
10. <5, 2, 0>
11. <5, 4, 8>
12. <6, 1, 7>
13. <8, 4, 5>
14. <8, 6, 1>
15. <8, 9, 0>
16. <8, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
