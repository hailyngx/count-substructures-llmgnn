Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
