Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 8
