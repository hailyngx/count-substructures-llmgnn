Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, and <6, 7, 9>.
