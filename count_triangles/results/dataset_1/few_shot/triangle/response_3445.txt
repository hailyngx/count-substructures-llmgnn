Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [<<1, 2, 7>>, <<2, 6, 7>>, <<2, 7, 9>>, <<2, 8, 6>>, <<7, 1, 9>>, <<7, 2, 9>>]. There are 6 triangles in total.
