Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 6, 8> and <0, 6, 9>.
