Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
