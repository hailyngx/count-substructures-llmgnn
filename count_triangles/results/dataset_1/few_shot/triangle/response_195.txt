Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
