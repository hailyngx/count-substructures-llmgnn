Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
