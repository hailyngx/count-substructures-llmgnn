Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by examining all possible triangles formed by the three vertices. A triangle is formed when three nodes are pairwise connected to each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <5, 8, 9>
6. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
