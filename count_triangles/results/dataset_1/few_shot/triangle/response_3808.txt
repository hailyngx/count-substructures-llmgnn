Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 7, 2>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 6, 1>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 4>
<8, 0, 2>

So, there are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
