Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
