Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
