Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Based on the provided information, we can calculate the number of triangles in the graph by finding unique combinations of nodes that form triangles. 

Let's identify the triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, and 3.
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 3.
3. Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 0 and 1.
4. Node 4 does not form any triangles as it only has connections with nodes 0, 5, and 7, but there are no connections between nodes 5 and 7.
5. Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 4.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 3, and these triangles are:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 3>, <3, 4, 5>.

Thus, the output should be: [3].
