Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3
