Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
