Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
