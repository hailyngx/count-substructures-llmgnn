Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
