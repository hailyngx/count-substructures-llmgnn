Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
