Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
The graph described is as follows:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 1)

Next, we will identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <0, 6, 8>
5. <1, 3, 8>
6. <1, 4, 8>
7. <2, 1, 4>
8. <2, 3, 7>
9. <3, 4, 8>
10. <3, 6, 8>
11. <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph. 

Total number of triangles: [11]
