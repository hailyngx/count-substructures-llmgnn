Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be found by looking for nodes that have edges connecting all three possible pairs. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
