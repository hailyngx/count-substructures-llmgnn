Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
In order to count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

After carefully examining the given graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <0, 5, 6>
5. <3, 4, 5>
6. <3, 4, 6>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
