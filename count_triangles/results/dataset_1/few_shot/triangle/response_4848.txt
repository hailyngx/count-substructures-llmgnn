Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each possible triangle formed by three nodes. 

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 1, 8>
4. <0, 4, 6>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
