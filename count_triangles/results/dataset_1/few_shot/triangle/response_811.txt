Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
