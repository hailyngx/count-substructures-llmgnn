Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
1. <2, 0, 1>
2. <2, 1, 5>
3. <4, 1, 5>
4. <4, 1, 2>
5. <4, 3, 2>
6. <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
