Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
From the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
