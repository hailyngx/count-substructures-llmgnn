Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of triangles each node belongs to. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Given the graph, we can determine the triangles by examining the neighbors of each node.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
[<0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <4, 5, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [3].
