Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
