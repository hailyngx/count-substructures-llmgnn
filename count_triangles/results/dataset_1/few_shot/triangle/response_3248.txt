Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected to each other. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can find the triangles by examining each node's connections. Let's list the unique triangles that can be formed:

<0, 1, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 3, 4>
<4, 5, 9>

There are 4 triangles in total in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
