Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 8>.
