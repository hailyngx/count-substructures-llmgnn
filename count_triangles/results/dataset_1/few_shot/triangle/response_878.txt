Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
