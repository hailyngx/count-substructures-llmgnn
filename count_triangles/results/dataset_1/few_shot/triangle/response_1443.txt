Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
