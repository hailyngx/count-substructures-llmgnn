Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are:
<0, 2, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<2, 5, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [5].
