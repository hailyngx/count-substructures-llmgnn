Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each possible triangle formed by sets of three nodes and count the ones that form triangles.

Looking at the given graph and adjacency list, the triangles that can be formed are as follows:
1. <0, 7, 8> 
2. <1, 6, 4>
3. <1, 6, 8>
4. <1, 8, 9>
5. <6, 4, 1>
6. <6, 4, 8>
7. <6, 1, 8>
8. <7, 0, 8>
9. <8, 0, 7>
10. <8, 0, 1>
11. <8, 1, 6>
12. <8, 1, 9>
13. <8, 7, 0>
14. <8, 7, 1>
15. <8, 7, 9>
16. <8, 9, 1>
17. <8, 9, 2>
18. <8, 9, 3>

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.
