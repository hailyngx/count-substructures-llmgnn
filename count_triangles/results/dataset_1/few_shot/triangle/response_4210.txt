Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all the triangles formed by nodes in the graph by looking for cycles of length 3.
2. Count the number of unique triangles.

Now, let's list the triangles and count the total number of triangles:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <0, 4, 6>
5. <0, 4, 9>
6. <0, 7, 9>
7. <3, 4, 9>
8. <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
