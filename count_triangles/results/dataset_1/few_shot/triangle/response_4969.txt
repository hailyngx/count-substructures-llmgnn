Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
