Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given graph, we will count the number of triangles.

A triangle in a graph is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. To find triangles efficiently, we can look for nodes that have mutual neighbors.

In this graph, the following triangles can be formed:
1. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
