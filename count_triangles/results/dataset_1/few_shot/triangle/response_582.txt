Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
