Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
[<0, 2, 3>, <2, 7, 8>]
