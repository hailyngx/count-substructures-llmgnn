Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 8>

The total number of triangles is [5].
