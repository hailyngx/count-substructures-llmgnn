Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
Let's start by identifying the triangles in the given graph:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle 3: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 4: <2, 5, 8>
- Triangle 5: <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle 6: <5, 7, 8>
- Triangle 7: <5, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
