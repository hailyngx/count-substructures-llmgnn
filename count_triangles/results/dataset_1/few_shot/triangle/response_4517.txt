Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>.
