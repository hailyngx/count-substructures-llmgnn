Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
