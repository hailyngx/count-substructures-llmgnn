Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 9: <0, 4, 9>
2. Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 9: <2, 3, 9>
3. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 8: <1, 6, 8>
4. Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 9: <2, 7, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 4]
