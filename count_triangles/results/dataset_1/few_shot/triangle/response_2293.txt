Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [8].
