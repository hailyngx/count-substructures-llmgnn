Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can count the number of triangles by examining each possible set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the unique triangles found:

<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles present in the graph is [7].
