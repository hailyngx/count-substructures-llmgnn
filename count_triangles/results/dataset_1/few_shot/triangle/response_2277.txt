Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
