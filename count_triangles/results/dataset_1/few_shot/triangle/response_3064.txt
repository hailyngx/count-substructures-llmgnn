Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- For a triangle, we need three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here, we have the following triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <3, 4, 6>
5. <0, 5, 2>
6. <0, 5, 6>
7. <2, 5, 6>
8. <3, 6, 7>
9. <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
