Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
Following are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
