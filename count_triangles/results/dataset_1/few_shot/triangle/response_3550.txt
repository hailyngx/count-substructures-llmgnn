Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
There are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, and <0, 8, 9> triangles in the given graph. 
Thus, the total number of triangles is [3].
