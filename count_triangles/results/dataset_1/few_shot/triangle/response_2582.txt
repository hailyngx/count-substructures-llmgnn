Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
There are 8 triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 6>.
