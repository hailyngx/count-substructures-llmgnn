Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
