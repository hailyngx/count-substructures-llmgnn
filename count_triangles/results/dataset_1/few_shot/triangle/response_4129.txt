Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
