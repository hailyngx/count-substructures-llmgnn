Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. 
Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 8, 6>
<3, 0, 2>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 1, 9>
<9, 8, 6>
<9, 7, 1>
<9, 5, 2>
<9, 7, 4>

So, the total number of triangles is [16].
