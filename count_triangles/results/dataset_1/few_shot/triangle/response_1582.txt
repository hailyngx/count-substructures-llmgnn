Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<0, 2, 4>, 
<0, 4, 9>, 
<1, 2, 4>, 
<1, 4, 7>, 
<1, 4, 8>, 
<0, 5, 8>
So, the total number of triangles is [6].
