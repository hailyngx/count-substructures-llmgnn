Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
Number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 8>
