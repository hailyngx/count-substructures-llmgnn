Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
[<0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 4>] (2)
