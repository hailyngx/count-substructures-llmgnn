Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by finding sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Let's list the triangles: 
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
