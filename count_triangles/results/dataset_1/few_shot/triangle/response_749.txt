Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
