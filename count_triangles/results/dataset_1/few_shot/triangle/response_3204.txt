Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Calculating triangles in this graph:
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 4 form a triangle
- Node 2, Node 4, Node 8 form a triangle

[Total number of triangles: 2]  
<Triangles found:  <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 8>>
