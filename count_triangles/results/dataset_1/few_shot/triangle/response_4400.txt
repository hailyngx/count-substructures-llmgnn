Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
