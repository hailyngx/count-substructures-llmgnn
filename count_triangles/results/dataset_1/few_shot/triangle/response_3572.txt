Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. In simpler terms, we are looking for groups of three nodes where each node is directly connected to both of the other two nodes in the group.

By examining the adjacency list for each node provided, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <1, 6, 7>
3. <2, 6, 9>
4. <4, 7, 8>
5. <7, 8, 9>

There are 5 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
