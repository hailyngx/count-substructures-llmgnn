Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
Each triangle is a set of three nodes that are all adjacent to one another. To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify them by looking at each possible set of three nodes and checking if they form a triangle based on the given edges.

Let's list the unique triangles found in this graph:

<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 9, 1>
<2, 9, 3>
<4, 7, 1>
<9, 1, 2>
<9, 2, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **[17]**.
