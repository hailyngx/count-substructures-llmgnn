Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

List of unique triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
