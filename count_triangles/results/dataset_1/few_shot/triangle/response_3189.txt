Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
