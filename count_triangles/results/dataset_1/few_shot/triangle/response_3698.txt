Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 9
