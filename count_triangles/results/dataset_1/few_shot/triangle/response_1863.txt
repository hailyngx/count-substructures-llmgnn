Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
