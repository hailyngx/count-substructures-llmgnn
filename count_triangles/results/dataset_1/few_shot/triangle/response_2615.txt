Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see the possible triangles can be formed by examining the common neighbors of each node.

Node 0: Neighbors (4, 6, 7, 9)
Common neighbors:
- With 4: (0, 4, 9), (4, 5, 9)
- With 6: No common neighbor
- With 7: No common neighbor
- With 9: (0, 4, 9), (4, 5, 9)

So, triangles involving node 0: <0, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 9>

Node 1: Neighbors (2, 5)
Common neighbors:
- With 2: (1, 5, 2)
- With 5: (1, 5, 2)

So, triangle involving node 1: <1, 5, 2>

Node 2: Neighbors (1, 5, 6, 8)
Common neighbors:
- With 1: (1, 5, 2)
- With 5: (1, 5, 2)

So, triangle involving node 2: <1, 5, 2>

Node 3: Neighbors (4, 8)
No triangle can be formed with these neighbors.

Node 4: Neighbors (0, 3, 5, 9)
Common neighbors:
- With 0: (0, 4, 9)
- With 3: No common neighbor
- With 5: (4, 5, 9), (4, 5, 8)
- With 9: (0, 4, 9), (4, 5, 9)

So, triangles involving node 4: <0, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 8>

Node 5: Neighbors (1, 2, 4, 8, 9)
Common neighbors:
- With 1: (1, 5, 2)
- With 2: (1, 5, 2)
- With 4: (4, 5, 9), (4, 5, 8)
- With 8: (4, 5, 8)

So, triangles involving node 5: <1, 5, 2>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 8>

Node 6: Neighbors (0, 2)
No triangle can be formed with these neighbors.

Node 7: Neighbors (0, 9)
No triangle can be formed with these neighbors.

Node 8: Neighbors (2, 3, 5)
No triangle can be formed with these neighbors.

Node 9: Neighbors (0, 4, 5, 7)
Common neighbors:
- With 0: (0, 4, 9)
- With 4: (0, 4, 9)
- With 5: (4, 5, 9)

So, triangle involving node 9: <0, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7] and the unique triangles are <0, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 2>.
