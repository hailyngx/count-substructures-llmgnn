Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
