Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
