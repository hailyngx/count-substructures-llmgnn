Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
[<0, 1, 7>]
[<0, 5, 8>]
[<1, 7, 8>]

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
