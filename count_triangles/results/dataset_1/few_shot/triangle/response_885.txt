Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
