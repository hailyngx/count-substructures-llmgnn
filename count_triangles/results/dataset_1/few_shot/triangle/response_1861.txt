Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8
