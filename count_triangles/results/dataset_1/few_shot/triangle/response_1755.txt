Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<4, 8, 5>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
