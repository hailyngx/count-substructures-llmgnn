Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph based on the given information.

First, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 1, 0>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <2, 8, 9>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>

There are a total of 7 triangles in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
