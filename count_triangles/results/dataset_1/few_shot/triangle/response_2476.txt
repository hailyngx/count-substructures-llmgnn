Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
There are 3 unique triangles in this graph. 
The triangles are: 
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
So, the total number of triangles is [3].
