Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles: 

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
