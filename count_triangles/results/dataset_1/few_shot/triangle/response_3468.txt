Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
