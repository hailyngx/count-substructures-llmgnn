Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
[<0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 3>, <0, 6, 5>, <1, 8, 4>, <3, 6, 5>]

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
