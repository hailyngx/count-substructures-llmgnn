Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. An important property of a triangle in a graph is that it consists of three nodes all connected to each other.

From the given information, we can see that the triangles in this graph are as follows:

1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <3, 4, 8>
3. <3, 5, 7>
4. <3, 6, 8>
5. <3, 6, 9>
6. <4, 6, 8>
7. <4, 6, 9>
8. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
