Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
