Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
