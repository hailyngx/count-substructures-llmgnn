Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: 

[<0, 4, 9> <4, 6, 9>]

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
