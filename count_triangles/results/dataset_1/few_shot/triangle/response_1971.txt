Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
The triangles in this graph are: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, and <8, 9, 7>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
