Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 8
