Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph:
- Triangle <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle <1, 3, 2>
- Triangle <1, 3, 4>
- Triangle <3, 6, 8>
- Triangle <3, 6, 5>
- Triangle <3, 8, 9>
- Triangle <3, 9, 7>
- Triangle <6, 8, 9>
- Triangle <6, 8, 4>
- Triangle <6, 5, 9>
- Triangle <8, 4, 1>
- Triangle <8, 4, 6>
- Triangle <8, 9, 7>
- Triangle <9, 5, 6>
- Triangle <9, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [16].
