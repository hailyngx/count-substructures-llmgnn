Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the graph and given information, let's list down the triangles:
1. <0, 2, 1>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 2, 4>
4. <0, 7, 8>
5. <1, 2, 4>
6. <1, 4, 7>
7. <2, 4, 6>
8. <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
