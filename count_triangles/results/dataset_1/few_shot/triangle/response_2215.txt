Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
