Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>.
