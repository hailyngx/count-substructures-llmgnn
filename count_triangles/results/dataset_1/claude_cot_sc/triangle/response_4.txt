2. Consider Pairs of Neighbors: The neighbor pairs for Node 0 are (3, 6), (3, 7), and (6, 7).

3. Verify Triangles for Each Pair:

Pair (3, 6):
Check Connection with Node 0: Both Node 3 and Node 6 are connected with Node 0. 
Check Direct Connection: Node 3 and Node 6 are connected with each other.
Since both conditions are met, Nodes 0, 3, and 6 form a triangle.

Check Direct Connection: Node 6 and Node 7 are connected with each other.
Since both conditions are met, Nodes 0, 6, and 7 form a triangle.

4. Count Unique Triangles Involving Node 0:
