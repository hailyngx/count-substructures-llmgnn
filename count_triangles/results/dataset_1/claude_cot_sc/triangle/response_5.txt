2. Consider pairs of neighbors: The neighbor pairs for Node 0 are (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9), (4, 6), (4, 9) and (6, 9).

3. Verify triangles for each pair:

Pair (1, 4): 
- Check connection with Node 0: Both Nodes 1 and 4 are connected to Node 0. 
- Check direct connection: Nodes 1 and 4 are not connected. 
- Therefore, Nodes 0, 1 and 4 do NOT form a triangle.

Pair (1, 6):
- Check connection with Node 0: Both Nodes 1 and 6 are connected to Node 0.  
- Check direct connection: Nodes 1 and 6 are connected.

Pair (4, 6): 
- Check connection with Node 0: Both Nodes 4 and 6 are connected to Node 0.
- Check direct connection: Nodes 4 and 6 are not connected.
