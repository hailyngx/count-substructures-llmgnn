Here are the steps to count and list the triangles for the given graph:

1. Identify the neighbors of Node 0: Node 0 is connected to Node 3. 
2. Consider the neighbor pairs for Node 0: The only neighbor pair for Node 0 is (3, 3). 
3. Verify triangles for each pair:
Pair (3, 3):
Check connection with Node 0: Node 3 is connected to Node 0. 
Check direct connection: Node 3 is connected to itself, so this pair does not form a triangle.  
Since there is no triangle formed with Node 0, there are 0 triangles involving Node 0.
