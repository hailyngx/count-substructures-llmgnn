First, count and list the triangles in node 0 for this graph

Response:
Here are the steps to count and list the triangles in the given graph:

1. Identify neighbors of Node 0: Neighbors of Node 0 are Node 6.

2. Consider pairs of neighbors: The only neighbor pair for Node 0 is (6). 

3. Verify triangles for each pair:

Pair (6):
- Check connection with Node 0: Both Node 0 and Node 6 are connected.
- Check direct connection: Node 0 and Node 6 are directly connected.
- Nodes 0, 6 form a triangle.

Count unique triangles involving Node 0: There is 1 unique triangle involving Node 0:
Triangle formed by Nodes 0, 6.

Now, to find the total triangles in the graph:

1. For each node in the graph, find its neighbors and neighbor pairs. Verify if they form triangles.

2. Count the unique triangles and add to the total.

3. Avoid counting the same triangle more than once.

The total triangles in the graph are:

Node 0: 1 triangle <0, 6> 
Node 1: 0 triangles
Node 2: 0 triangles 
Node 3: 0 triangles
Node 4: 0 triangles
Node 5: 0 triangles
