Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 10) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 18) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 19) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 0) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 14) (15, 7) (15, 19) (19, 9) (19, 12) (19, 15) (11, 18) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 16) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 2) (16, 5) (16, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 18) (17, 12) (17, 8)
