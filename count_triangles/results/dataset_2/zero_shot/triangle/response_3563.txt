Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 5, 0>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 1, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, and <0, 5, 7>.
