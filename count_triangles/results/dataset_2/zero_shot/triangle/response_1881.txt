Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 13) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [31]. The unique triangles are <1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 13>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 11, 0>, <1, 11, 5>, <1, 11, 7>, <1, 11, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 7, 6>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 14>, <2, 8, 6>, <2, 8, 7>, <2, 8, 14>, <2, 14, 6>, <2, 14, 7>, <2, 14, 8>, <3, 6, 12>, <3, 6, 13>, <3, 6, 1>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 0>, <6, 13, 1>, <6, 13, 12>, <6, 13, 3>, <6, 8, 7>, <6, 8, 2>, <6, 8, 3>, <12, 13, 6>, <12, 13, 1>.
