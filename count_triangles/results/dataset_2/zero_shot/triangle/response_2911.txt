Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (5, 4) (5, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 11) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 8, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 9, 14>
<7, 8, 10>
<7, 11, 12>
<7, 12, 14>
<8, 10, 14>
<10, 11, 14>
