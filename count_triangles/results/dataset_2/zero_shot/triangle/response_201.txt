Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 12>, <0, 3, 12>, <1, 5, 14>, <3, 10, 13>, <3, 10, 14>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 13>, <4, 8, 13>, <5, 8, 14>.
