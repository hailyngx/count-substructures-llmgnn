Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 0) (15, 10) (15, 16) (15, 9) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 19) (16, 10) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 4) (6, 18) (14, 19) (14, 4) (12, 16) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 15) (9, 19) (18, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 14) (19, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 14)
