Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (8, 3) (8, 19) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 19) (19, 8) (19, 9) (19, 11) (19, 16) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 13) (4, 11) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 10) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 15) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 18) (10, 16) (10, 2) (18, 12) (18, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 15) (15, 2) (15, 17)
