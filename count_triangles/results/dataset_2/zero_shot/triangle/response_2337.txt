Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 10) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 18) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 14) (17, 19) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 19) (3, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 15) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 19) (18, 13) (18, 12) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 3) (19, 1) (4, 13) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 12) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 15)
