Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3)
