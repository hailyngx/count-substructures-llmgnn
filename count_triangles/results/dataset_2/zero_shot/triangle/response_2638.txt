Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 9) 

Response:
There are [9] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<4, 7, 1>
<4, 7, 13>
<4, 7, 10>
<3, 7, 1>
<3, 7, 13>
<3, 7, 10>
<2, 8, 11>
<2, 8, 13>
<2, 11, 14>
