Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 1) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 19) (4, 8) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 19) (5, 11) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 1) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 14) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 11) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 2) (15, 4) (15, 14) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 15) (3, 4) (3, 16) (3, 19)
