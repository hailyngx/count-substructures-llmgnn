Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 10) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 10) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 1) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [34].
The unique triangles found are <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 14>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 8, 12>, <2, 8, 3>, <2, 10, 12>, <2, 10, 14>, <4, 6, 2>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 6, 11>, <4, 5, 13>, <4, 2, 6>, <4, 2, 14>, <4, 13, 5>, <6, 5, 13>, <6, 2, 4>, <6, 2, 14>, <6, 11, 4>, <4, 6, 2>, <4, 11, 6>, <5, 13, 4>, <5, 13, 7>, <5, 3, 8>, <7, 13, 5>, <7, 13, 12>, <7, 12, 13>, <9, 14, 12>, <10, 1, 11>, <2, 14, 4>, <2, 14, 1>, <2, 14, 12>, <2, 14, 9>, <10, 3, 8>, <9, 0, 11>, and <9, 14, 2>.
