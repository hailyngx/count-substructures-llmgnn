Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
Unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 8, 3>.
