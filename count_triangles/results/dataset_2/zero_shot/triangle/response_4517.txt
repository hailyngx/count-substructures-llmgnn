Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 1) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 13, 4>, <0, 14, 4>, <0, 14, 5>, <1, 7, 11>, <1, 7, 14>, <1, 9, 14>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 14>, <3, 8, 13>, <3, 8, 2>, <4, 13, 14>, <7, 11, 12>, <7, 12, 13>, <8, 10, 12>, <8, 13, 12>, <10, 12, 13>.
