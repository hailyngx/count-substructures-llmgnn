Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 13) (2, 9) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
