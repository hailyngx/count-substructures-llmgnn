Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 6) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4)
