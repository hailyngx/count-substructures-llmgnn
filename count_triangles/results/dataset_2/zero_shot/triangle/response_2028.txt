Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0)
