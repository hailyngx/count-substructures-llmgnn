Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are <4, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <5, 3, 9>, <5, 3, 1>, <7, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 4>, <2, 7, 9>, <0, 6, 4>.
