Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (7, 13) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 14) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9)
