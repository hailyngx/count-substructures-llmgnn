Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 4)
