Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 26) (11, 25) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 23) (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (29, 16) (29, 17) (29, 1) (1, 2) (1, 29) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 24) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 23) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 24) (17, 16) (17, 29) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 21) (26, 11) (26, 13) (26, 19) (21, 19) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 19) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 28) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 27) (14, 4) (25, 11) (25, 22) (25, 18) (27, 14) (27, 22) (27, 10) (6, 15) (6, 14) (24, 8) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 10) (18, 19) (18, 25) (18, 23) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 0) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 27) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 23) (10, 2) (10, 27) (10, 24) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 18) (23, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12]. 
The unique triangles found are <3, 15, 7>, <3, 15, 0>, <5, 11, 3>, <5, 11, 19>, <5, 19, 18>, <15, 6, 14>, <9, 28, 21>, <9, 28, 22>, <9, 7, 24>, <12, 7, 24>, <12, 24, 10>, <14, 27, 22>.
