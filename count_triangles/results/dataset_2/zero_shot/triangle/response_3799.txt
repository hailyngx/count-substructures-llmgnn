Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 4) (2, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 0) (1, 17) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 12) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 3) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 18) (18, 7) (19, 15) (19, 3) (3, 16) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 3) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 15) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<7, 11, 16>
<3, 11, 4>
<3, 4, 16>
<4, 6, 14>
<4, 12, 17>
<4, 10, 15>
<15, 17, 12>
<5, 7, 16>
