Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [36].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 8, 13>
<3, 4, 12>
<5, 6, 10>
<5, 7, 11>
<6, 10, 13>
