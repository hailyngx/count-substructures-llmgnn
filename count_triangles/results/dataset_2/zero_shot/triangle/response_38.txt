Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2)
