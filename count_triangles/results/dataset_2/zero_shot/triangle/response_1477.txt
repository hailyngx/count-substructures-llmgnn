Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 17) (18, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 2) (13, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (6, 16) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 19) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 19) (9, 18) (9, 0) (12, 11) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 17) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 2)
