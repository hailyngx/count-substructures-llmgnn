Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 9) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 13) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 6) 

Response:
There are [24] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 5>, <0, 1, 5>, <3, 10, 13>, <2, 3, 11>, <6, 11, 13>, <8, 11, 13>.
