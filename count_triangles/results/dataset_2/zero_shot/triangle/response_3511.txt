Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 17) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 16) (13, 5) (13, 3) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 11) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 3) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 3) (12, 18) (12, 0) (3, 13) (3, 16) (3, 14)
