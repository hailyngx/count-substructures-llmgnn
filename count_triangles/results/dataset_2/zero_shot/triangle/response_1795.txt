Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 4>, <7, 8, 6>.
