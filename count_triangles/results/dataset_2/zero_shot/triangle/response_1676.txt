Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
