Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 19) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 5) (17, 2) (17, 15) (18, 4) (18, 9) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 0) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 6) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 12) (9, 8) (9, 18) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 19) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 1) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 3)
