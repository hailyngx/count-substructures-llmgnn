Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) (4, 13) (4, 18) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 19) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 17) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 2) (6, 12) (6, 5) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 8) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 11) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 15) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 11) (17, 0) (10, 7) (10, 16)
