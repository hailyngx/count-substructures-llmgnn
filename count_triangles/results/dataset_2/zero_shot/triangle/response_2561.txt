Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (16, 11) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 19) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (17, 9) (17, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 18) (14, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (1, 11) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 3) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 13) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 4) (18, 14)
