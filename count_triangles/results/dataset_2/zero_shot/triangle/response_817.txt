Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 18) (16, 10) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 7) (6, 7) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 15) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 2) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 4) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 13) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 0) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
[<0, 2, 4> <0, 4, 10> <0, 4, 12> <0, 4, 19> <0, 8, 15> <0, 8, 19> <2, 14, 17> <2, 14, 18> <2, 18, 16> <2, 18, 19> <4, 10, 16> <4, 10, 19> <4, 12, 17> <4, 12, 19> <4, 14, 17> <4, 14, 19> <8, 13, 15> <8, 13, 19> <8, 15, 16> <8, 15, 19> <13, 15, 16>]
