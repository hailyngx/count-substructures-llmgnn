Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 9) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 6)
