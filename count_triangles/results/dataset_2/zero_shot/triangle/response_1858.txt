Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 15) (14, 0) (14, 11) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 15) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 18) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 7) (19, 5) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 15) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 7) (3, 17) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 18) (16, 6) (16, 18) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 16)
