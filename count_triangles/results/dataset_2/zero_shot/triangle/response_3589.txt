Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 11) (12, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 5) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 14) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 5) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 15) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 15) (16, 1) (16, 13) (17, 4) (17, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 17) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 19)
