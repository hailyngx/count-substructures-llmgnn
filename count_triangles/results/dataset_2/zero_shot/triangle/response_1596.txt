Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 24) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 28) (27, 1) (27, 13) (7, 21) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 16) (2, 1) (2, 15) (18, 27) (18, 20) (15, 0) (15, 2) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 16) (20, 18) (20, 15) (20, 29) (28, 27) (28, 26) (28, 4) (1, 27) (1, 2) (17, 12) (17, 22) (17, 11) (26, 28) (26, 6) (26, 4) (3, 21) (3, 19) (29, 20) (29, 13) (9, 15) (9, 24) (5, 10) (10, 5) (10, 25) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 24) (11, 25) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 19) (6, 26) (6, 24) (24, 0) (24, 9) (24, 11) (24, 6) (24, 19) (16, 21) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 23) (22, 17) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 8) (8, 22) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 23) (13, 27) (13, 29) (13, 16) (13, 12) (4, 28) (4, 26) (4, 23) (23, 16) (23, 12) (23, 4) (23, 19) (19, 3) (19, 14) (19, 24) (19, 23) (19, 25) (25, 10) (25, 11) (25, 22) (25, 19) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <9, 15, 20>, <4, 6, 26>, <3, 19, 22>, <25, 19, 22>, <23, 19, 25>, <25, 11, 22>, <13, 27, 29>, <13, 12, 16>, <9, 15, 24>, <16, 21, 3>, <11, 25, 22>, <0, 15, 24>, <27, 0, 15>, <27, 1, 2>, <17, 11, 25>, <17, 12, 13>.
