Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [26].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 9, 7>.
