Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 5) (6, 9) (6, 19) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 10) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) (17, 9) (17, 18) (12, 4) (12, 7) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 16) (14, 0) (14, 13) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 18) (19, 6) (19, 4) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 8) (2, 10) (2, 13) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles found in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are <3, 7, 4>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 15, 1>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 10, 5>, <6, 13, 2>, <14, 0, 18>, <16, 14, 0>.
