Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [ <0, 2, 4> <0, 4, 10> <1, 6, 11> <8, 10, 12> ] triangles in the given graph.
