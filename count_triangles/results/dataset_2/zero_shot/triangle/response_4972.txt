Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <1, 6, 3>, <1, 0, 2>, <0, 6, 4>, and <5, 7, 1>.
