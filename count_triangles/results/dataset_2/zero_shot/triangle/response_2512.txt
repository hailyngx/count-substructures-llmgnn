Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <3, 5, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 5>.
