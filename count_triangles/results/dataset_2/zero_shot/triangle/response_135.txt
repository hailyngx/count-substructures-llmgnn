Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 13) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 1) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 9) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 9) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (4, 5) (4, 14)
