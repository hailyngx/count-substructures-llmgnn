Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 14) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 10) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 10)
