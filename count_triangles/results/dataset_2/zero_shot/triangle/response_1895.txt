Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 18) (17, 14) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 1) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 9) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 6) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 11) (19, 2) (19, 16) (18, 14) (18, 0) (16, 19) (16, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 16) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 11)
