Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 9, 5>, <0, 9, 7>, <0, 9, 6>, <1, 9, 2>, <1, 9, 6>.
