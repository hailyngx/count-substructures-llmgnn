Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 5) (7, 11) (7, 19) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 15) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 14) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 9) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 6) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 15) (15, 2) (15, 14) (18, 13) (18, 10) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 0) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 16)
