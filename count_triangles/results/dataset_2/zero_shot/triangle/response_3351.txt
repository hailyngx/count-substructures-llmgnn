Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 9) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 17) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (0, 14) (0, 19) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 16) (18, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 10) (7, 14) (1, 17) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 6) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 16) (8, 15) (8, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

<[3, 13, 5]>
<[3, 2, 6]>
<[4, 12, 18]>
<[9, 10, 1]>

Total number of triangles: [4]
