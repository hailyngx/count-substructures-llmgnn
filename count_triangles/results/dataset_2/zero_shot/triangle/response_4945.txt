Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 9) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 7) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (4, 18) (5, 16) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 15) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 19) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 17) (8, 1) (8, 17) (10, 2) (10, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 8) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 5)
