Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 12) (10, 18) (10, 13) (12, 6) (12, 18) (12, 1) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 19) (2, 9) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 9) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 19) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 18) (18, 16) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 0)
