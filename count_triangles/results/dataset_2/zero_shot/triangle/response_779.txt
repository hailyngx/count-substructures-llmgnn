Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 9) (16, 19) (5, 15) (9, 16) (9, 14) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (0, 7) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 8) (15, 5) (15, 10) (15, 14) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 19) (6, 11) (6, 19) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 18) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 3) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 3) (18, 10) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 8) (13, 7) (13, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 18) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<1, 14, 3>
<3, 4, 14>
<7, 13, 18>
<10, 15, 14>
<12, 16, 19>
<2, 4, 16>
