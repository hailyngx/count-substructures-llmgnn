Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 7) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<3, 8, 13>
<3, 9, 11>
<5, 7, 14>
<6, 12, 10>
