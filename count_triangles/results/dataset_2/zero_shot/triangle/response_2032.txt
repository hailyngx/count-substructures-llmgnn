Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (13, 9) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 3) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1) 

Response:
There are total of 8 triangles in the graph. 
The unique triangles are <1, 6, 10>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 8, 14>, <3, 4, 12>, <5, 7, 12>, <5, 7, 10>, <5, 9, 12>, and <8, 11, 12>.
