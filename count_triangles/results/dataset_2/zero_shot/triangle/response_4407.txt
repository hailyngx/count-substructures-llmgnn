Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. 

[10]

Unique triangles: <1, 5, 3>, <2, 7, 4>, <6, 5, 3>, <0, 7, 2>, <3, 9, 1>, <4, 9, 3>, <0, 6, 4>, <1, 9, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 3>
