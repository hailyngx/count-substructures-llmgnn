Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>.
