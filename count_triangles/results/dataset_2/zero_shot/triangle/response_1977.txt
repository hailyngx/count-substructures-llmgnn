Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 3>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 0>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 8>.
