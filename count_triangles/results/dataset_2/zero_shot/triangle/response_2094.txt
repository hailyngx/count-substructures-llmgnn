Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5)
