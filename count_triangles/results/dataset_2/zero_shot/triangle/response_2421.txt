Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
There are [12] triangles in this graph.
The unique triangles found are: <5, 1, 4>, <5, 2, 1>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 1, 3>, <5, 0, 8>, <5, 3, 4>, <9, 7, 8>, <9, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 4>, <8, 6, 7>.
