Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 3>, <4, 6, 3>, <6, 9, 0>, and <6, 9, 1>.
