Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0)
