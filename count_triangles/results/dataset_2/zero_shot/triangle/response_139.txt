Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 5) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 2)
