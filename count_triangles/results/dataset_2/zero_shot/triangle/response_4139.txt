Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 0) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 6) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 6) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [20]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 13>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 12, 14>, <2, 8, 5>, <2, 13, 5>, <3, 7, 11>, <3, 12, 1>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 6, 10>, <5, 8, 10>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 10, 12>, <9, 1, 14>, <9, 13, 5>, <10, 6, 4>, <11, 7, 3>, <12, 1, 2>, <12, 6, 10>, <13, 5, 1>.
