Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6)
