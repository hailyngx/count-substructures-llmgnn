Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (13, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [10].
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 10>, <0, 2, 12>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 12>, <2, 10, 12>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 12>, <4, 8, 12>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 14>.
