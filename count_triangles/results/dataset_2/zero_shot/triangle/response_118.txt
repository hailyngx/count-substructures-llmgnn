Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 0) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 4) (18, 19) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (15, 16) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 13) 

Response:
There are [ <0, 13, 19>, <0, 5, 19>, <1, 4, 12>, <2, 7, 14>, <2, 9, 11>, <4, 10, 16>, <4, 12, 19>, <4, 13, 10>, <6, 7, 13>, <8, 14, 16> ] triangles in the graph.
