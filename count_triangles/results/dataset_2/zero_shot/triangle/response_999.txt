Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 2) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 7) (5, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (0, 11) (0, 9) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (18, 19) (18, 15) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 9) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 18)
