Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 7) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 1) (11, 18) (11, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 6) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (7, 17) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 19) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 16) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 13) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 19) (19, 16) (19, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:

<1, 14, 17>
<2, 8, 12>
<2, 8, 16>
<3, 1, 10>
<4, 6, 18>
<4, 9, 18>
<8, 11, 18>
<13, 15, 17>
