Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [23]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 14>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 11, 14>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 12, 13>, <2, 7, 0>, <2, 11, 14>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 11, 14>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 12, 1>, <6, 9, 10>, <9, 13, 1>, <10, 6, 9>, <10, 8, 9>, <11, 8, 9>, <11, 0, 14>, <11, 2, 14>, <12, 1, 13>.
