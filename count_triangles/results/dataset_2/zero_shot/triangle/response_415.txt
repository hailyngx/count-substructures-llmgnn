Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 9) (15, 24) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 8) (4, 1) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 10) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 0) (22, 16) (22, 0) (22, 3) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 8) (20, 24) (25, 20) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 24) (28, 10) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 13) (29, 5) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 27) (8, 20) (8, 2) (8, 9) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 9) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 11) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 26) (1, 4) (1, 20) (1, 12) (17, 13) (6, 18) (6, 21) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 23) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 19) (13, 29) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 16) (23, 26) (23, 21) (23, 14) (14, 23) (14, 12) (16, 22) (16, 13) (16, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 10) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 0) (0, 18) (0, 22) (0, 3) (0, 5) (10, 7) (10, 28) (10, 12) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 28) (5, 29) (5, 16) (5, 0)
