Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 10) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 15) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (18, 13) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 13) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 13) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 19) (19, 16) (19, 3) (11, 5) (11, 0) (3, 6) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 16) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 12) (10, 9) (10, 14) (8, 0) (8, 16)
