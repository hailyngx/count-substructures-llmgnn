Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 6>, <4, 7, 3>, <4, 1, 0>, <4, 3, 6>, <4, 6, 5>, <3, 6, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <6, 8, 0>.
