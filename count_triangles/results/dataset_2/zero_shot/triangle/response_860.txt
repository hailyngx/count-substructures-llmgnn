Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (16, 14) (16, 10) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 3) (1, 6) (1, 18) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 12) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 19) (2, 3) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 10) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 18) (18, 1) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are: <2, 3, 9>, <6, 8, 14>, <6, 10, 19>, <6, 10, 4>, <7, 12, 18>, <7, 12, 9>, <7, 13, 12>, <10, 16, 6>, <10, 18, 17>, <14, 16, 19>.
