Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 15) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 19) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 16) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 7) (12, 9) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 19) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 13) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 0) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 16) (13, 19) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 19) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 0>
<1, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 0>
<3, 4, 13>
<9, 10, 12>
<13, 16, 19>
