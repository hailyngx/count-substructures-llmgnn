Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are: 
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<5, 4, 7>
<0, 1, 5>
<2, 6, 8>

So, the total number of triangles is [7].
