Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 18) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 19) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 7) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 10) (16, 5) (16, 0) (7, 17) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (12, 13) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 19) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 2) (14, 5) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 19) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 14) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles are <0, 9, 16>, <1, 2, 10>, <1, 2, 17>, <1, 3, 18>, <6, 11, 19>, <13, 15, 17>.
