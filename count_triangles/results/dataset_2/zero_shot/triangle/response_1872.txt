Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 10) (19, 15) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 10) (5, 14) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (12, 15) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 3) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 11) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].

The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 16>, <0, 8, 10>, <0, 8, 16>, <3, 4, 16>, <4, 11, 18>, <4, 6, 11>, <4, 8, 10>, <9, 1, 13>, <9, 2, 7>, <9, 2, 16>, <9, 7, 8>, <10, 4, 16>, <10, 8, 16>, <11, 15, 18>, <11, 15, 6>, <15, 11, 18>.
