Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 4) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10)
