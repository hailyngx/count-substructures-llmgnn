Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <1, 9, 5>, <5, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <0, 3, 4>.
