Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 10) (5, 11) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (4, 13) (4, 17) (18, 7) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 19) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (15, 13) (15, 17) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 12) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 19) (12, 2) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 13) (17, 4) (17, 15) (13, 4) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 3) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 14)
