Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 5) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 19) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 16) (1, 27) (1, 26) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 11) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 8) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 25) (8, 18) (8, 2) (8, 28) (19, 0) (19, 26) (19, 23) (19, 9) (17, 27) (17, 4) (17, 13) (17, 9) (11, 0) (11, 26) (11, 23) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 29) (23, 19) (23, 11) (16, 0) (16, 27) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 5) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 6) (6, 12) (6, 29) (24, 3) (24, 25) (9, 19) (9, 17) (9, 20) (29, 26) (29, 13) (29, 6) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 10) (7, 1) (7, 14) (21, 13) (21, 5) (20, 9) (14, 16) (14, 7) (14, 25) (22, 0) (22, 27) (22, 10) (25, 2) (25, 24) (25, 14) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 21) (10, 2) (10, 28) (10, 22) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [32]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 11, 26>, <0, 16, 27>, <1, 8, 26>, <4, 12, 16>, <4, 17, 26>, <4, 17, 29>, <4, 18, 26>, <4, 18, 8>, <5, 14, 16>, <5, 15, 16>, <5, 15, 21>, <5, 16, 21>, <6, 12, 29>, <7, 14, 16>, <8, 10, 22>, <8, 28, 10>, <9, 17, 19>, <9, 17, 20>, <9, 19, 23>, <10, 22, 28>, <13, 17, 29>, <13, 21, 5>, <14, 16, 25>, <17, 9, 19>, <19, 9, 20>, <22, 0, 27>, <22, 10, 28>, <24, 25, 2>, <5, 15, 16>
