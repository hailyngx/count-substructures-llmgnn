Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 16) (1, 3) (1, 7) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 14) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 7) (6, 10) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 16) (18, 8) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (16, 17) (16, 12) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 9) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7)
