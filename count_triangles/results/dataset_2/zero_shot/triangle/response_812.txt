Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 14)
