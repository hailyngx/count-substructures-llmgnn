Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<4, 7, 11>

<4, 8, 11>
<4, 9, 14>
<10, 11, 7>
<10, 12, 5>
<10, 12, 13>
<2, 6, 13>
<2, 5, 6>
