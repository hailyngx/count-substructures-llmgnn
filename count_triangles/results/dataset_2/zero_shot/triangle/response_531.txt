Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 5) (16, 12) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 19) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 7) (15, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 19) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 8) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 0) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 7) (0, 12) (0, 18) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [14].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <5, 8, 10>, <5, 8, 14>, <5, 8, 19>, <5, 9, 18>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 16>, <8, 10, 2>, <3, 7, 2>, <3, 7, 1>, <2, 7, 10>, <4, 1, 7>, <4, 1, 19>, <4, 1, 12>, <13, 18, 0>.
