Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 8) (13, 21) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 7) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 19) (2, 27) (2, 28) (2, 0) (29, 0) (29, 3) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 6) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 8) (20, 22) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 12) (20, 24) (25, 20) (25, 14) (3, 29) (3, 17) (3, 27) (8, 13) (8, 21) (8, 24) (8, 17) (6, 7) (6, 18) (28, 2) (28, 4) (10, 9) (15, 26) (15, 11) (4, 28) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 20) (12, 4) (12, 0) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 15) (26, 11) (16, 5) (16, 9) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 11) (14, 25) (24, 20) (24, 8) (24, 27) (24, 19) (19, 9) (19, 24) (19, 1) (19, 27) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 24) (27, 19) (1, 19) (1, 23) (1, 0) (23, 21) (23, 1) (11, 15) (11, 4) (11, 26) (11, 17) (11, 18) (18, 6) (18, 11) (0, 22) (0, 2) (0, 29) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<7, 21, 23>, <9, 16, 5>, <9, 16, 26>, <9, 19, 24>, <9, 19, 27>, <11, 17, 3>, <11, 17, 26>, <11, 18, 6>, <11, 26, 15>, <12, 20, 24>, <17, 8, 21>, <20, 22, 7>, <20, 24, 27>, <20, 25, 14>, <20, 26, 15>, <21, 7, 22>, <26, 5, 16>, <26, 11, 15>.
