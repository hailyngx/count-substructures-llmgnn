Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 17) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 0) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 15) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (16, 4) (16, 1) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) (10, 6) (18, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 16) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 19) (15, 17) (19, 9) (19, 0)
