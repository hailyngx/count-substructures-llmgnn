Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 11>
<0, 8, 13>
<2, 8, 12>
