Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <4, 1, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 9>.
