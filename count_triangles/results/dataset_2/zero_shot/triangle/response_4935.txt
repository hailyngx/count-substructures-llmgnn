Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [9]. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, and <5, 8, 9>.
