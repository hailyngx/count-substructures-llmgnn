Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 11) (10, 18) (10, 16) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 7) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 15) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 15) (16, 10) (15, 5) (15, 11) (15, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 19) (13, 12) (1, 19)
