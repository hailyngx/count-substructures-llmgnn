Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 9) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 12>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 11>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 12, 14>, <3, 4, 12>, <5, 7, 14>, <9, 10, 13>, <9, 11, 13>, and <9, 7, 13>.
