Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 8) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (6, 7) (6, 13) (15, 9) (19, 4) (19, 9) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 13) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 17) (16, 9) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 3, 10>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 5, 12>, <1, 10, 13>, <3, 10, 13>, <3, 10, 11>, <8, 11, 18>, <8, 11, 3>, <8, 11, 18>, <8, 0, 12>, <8, 0, 17>, <8, 12, 0>, <8, 12, 5>, <8, 18, 17>, <11, 18, 17>, <9, 15, 16>.
