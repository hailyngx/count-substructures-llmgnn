Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 14) 

Response:
