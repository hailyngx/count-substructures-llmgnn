Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12]. 
The unique triangles found are <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 11>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 1, 5>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 11>, <4, 5, 3>, <4, 3, 1>, <4, 1, 8>, <4, 8, 6>, <8, 1, 4>.
