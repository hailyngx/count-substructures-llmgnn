Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 10) (6, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (18, 10) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 7) (8, 11) (8, 2) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 19) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 12) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 13) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 14) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 19) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 18) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 17) (0, 19) (17, 2) (17, 0) (14, 7) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <5, 10, 12>, <0, 13, 19>, <2, 7, 17>, <2, 8, 11>, <3, 4, 11>, <9, 15, 19>.
