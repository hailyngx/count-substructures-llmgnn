Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 16) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 12) (22, 1) (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 13) (16, 11) (16, 20) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 22) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 27) (3, 26) (9, 18) (9, 2) (26, 3) (26, 28) (26, 23) (12, 22) (12, 10) (12, 23) (27, 3) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 6) (0, 2) (0, 15) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (28, 26) (28, 19) (28, 5) (28, 10) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 8) (21, 27) (21, 29) (23, 26) (23, 12) (23, 25) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 4) (19, 14) (19, 28) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 29) (29, 21) (29, 15) (29, 7) (29, 8) (29, 5) (20, 16) (20, 10) (25, 13) (25, 23) (24, 27) (10, 12) (10, 28) (10, 20) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 28) (5, 29) (5, 4) (6, 22) (6, 27) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 29) (4, 15) (4, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [34].
The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 28>, <2, 7, 18>, <2, 7, 29>, <2, 9, 18>, <2, 14, 19>, <3, 1, 5>, <3, 1, 27>, <3, 1, 22>, <3, 26, 28>, <4, 5, 29>, <5, 11, 28>, <5, 11, 29>, <5, 28, 29>, <7, 17, 18>, <7, 17, 29>, <8, 11, 18>, <8, 11, 29>, <9, 18, 28>, <10, 12, 23>, <10, 12, 28>, <10, 20, 28>, <12, 22, 23>, <13, 16, 22>, <14, 19, 28>, <15, 17, 18>, <15, 17, 29>, <15, 29, 7>, <16, 20, 22>, <17, 18, 9>, <18, 7, 2>, <23, 12, 26>, <23, 25, 13>, <25, 13, 22>, <27, 3, 1>, <27, 3, 26>.
