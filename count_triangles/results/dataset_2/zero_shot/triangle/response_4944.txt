Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 13) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 8) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 9)
