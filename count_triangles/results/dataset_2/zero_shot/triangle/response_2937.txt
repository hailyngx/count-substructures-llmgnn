Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 13) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 9) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 18) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 1) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 12) (2, 3) (19, 1) (19, 3) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 18) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 3) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 3) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 13) (3, 18)
