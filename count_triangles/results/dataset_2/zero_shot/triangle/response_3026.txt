Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 5, 10>, <0, 5, 13>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 7, 13>, <2, 7, 12>, and <4, 6, 8>.
