Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
