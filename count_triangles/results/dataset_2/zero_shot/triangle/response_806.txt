Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph, and they are: 
<4, 7, 2>
<4, 7, 6>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 1, 6>
<7, 1, 6>
<7, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
