Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 13) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 2, 13>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 10, 13>, <0, 13, 14>, <2, 3, 13>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 10, 13>, <2, 13, 14>, <3, 8, 10>, <3, 9, 11>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 10, 14>, <6, 13, 14>, <8, 10, 13>, <9, 11, 13>, <0, 4, 10>, <2, 3, 13>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 10, 14>, <4, 6, 10>.
