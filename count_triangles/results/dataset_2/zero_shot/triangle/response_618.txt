Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles are <1, 6, 14>, <3, 8, 14>, <6, 10, 13>, <6, 10, 4>, <6, 12, 3>, <6, 12, 2>, <8, 10, 13>, <11, 13, 7>.
