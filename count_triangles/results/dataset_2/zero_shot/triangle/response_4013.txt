Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (4, 15) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 18) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 18) (19, 9) (19, 18) (0, 6) (0, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 5) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 14) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 12) (12, 15) (12, 11) (12, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14)
