Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles found in the given graph. 

[3]

The unique triangles found are: <1, 4, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <3, 7, 9>.
