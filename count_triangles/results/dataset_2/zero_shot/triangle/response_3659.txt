Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 13) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 11) (13, 2) (13, 18) (7, 6) (7, 5) (16, 5) (16, 18) (0, 10) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 16) (11, 5) (11, 1) (12, 10) (12, 5) (19, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph:

<2, 3, 15>
<4, 8, 15>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 10>
