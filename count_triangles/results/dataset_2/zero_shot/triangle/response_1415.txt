Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 14) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 14) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 1) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
