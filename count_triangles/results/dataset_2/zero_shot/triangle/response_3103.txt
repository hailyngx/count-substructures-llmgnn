Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 13) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 19) (1, 3) (1, 18) (12, 14) (18, 4) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 17) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 9) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 6) (9, 15) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 0) (13, 15) (13, 17) (0, 11) (0, 17) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 18) (10, 5) (10, 0) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 19) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 2)
