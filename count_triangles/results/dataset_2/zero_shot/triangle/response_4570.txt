Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 15) (16, 6) (4, 18) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 17) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 14) (8, 10) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (5, 17) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 17) (19, 3) (19, 12) (15, 16) (15, 18) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 19) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 0) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 18) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 1)
