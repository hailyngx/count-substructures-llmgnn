Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 10>, <0, 2, 12>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 12, 14>, <2, 11, 14>, <2, 3, 10>, <2, 3, 13>, <2, 6, 13>, <3, 7, 13>, <6, 7, 13>.
