Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 2) (6, 13) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <5, 9, 11>.
