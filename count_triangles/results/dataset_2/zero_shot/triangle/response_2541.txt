Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (15, 18) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 19) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 18) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 19) (16, 0) (16, 5) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 2) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 8) (19, 12) (19, 0) (19, 2) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 8) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 13) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 13) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 18) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
