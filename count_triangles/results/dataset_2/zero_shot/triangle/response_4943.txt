Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 16) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 6) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 18) (6, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 9) (8, 3) (8, 19) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 16) (0, 16) (0, 9) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 0) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 0) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<4, 13, 14>
<4, 7, 11>
<1, 5, 10>
<1, 5, 15>
<9, 1, 15>
<9, 1, 10>
<9, 1, 5>
<9, 0, 16>
<9, 0, 18>
<16, 0, 18>
<16, 0, 17>
<16, 12, 17>
