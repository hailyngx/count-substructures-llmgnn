Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (27, 15) (27, 22) (27, 1) (27, 13) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 22) (1, 27) (1, 26) (1, 6) (14, 23) (14, 9) (14, 21) (17, 6) (17, 8) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 13) (26, 1) (26, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 23) (20, 28) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 13) (28, 11) (28, 20) (28, 8) (28, 25) (5, 19) (5, 29) (9, 14) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 2) (29, 20) (29, 5) (29, 8) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 24) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (12, 10) (22, 27) (22, 4) (22, 7) (22, 6) (24, 11) (24, 21) (24, 8) (0, 13) (23, 14) (23, 20) (16, 4) (16, 18) (25, 19) (25, 28) (25, 9) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 29) (8, 21) (8, 24) (13, 27) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [14].
The unique triangles found are <27, 1, 26>, <27, 1, 6>, <27, 13, 4>, <27, 13, 0>, <1, 26, 19>, <1, 6, 17>, <4, 22, 7>, <4, 22, 6>, <4, 13, 19>, <9, 18, 16>, <9, 18, 4>, <9, 18, 16>, <9, 18, 4>, <9, 18, 16>.
