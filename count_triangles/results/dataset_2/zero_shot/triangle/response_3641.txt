Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (5, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 13)
