Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 8) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 8) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 2) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 12)
