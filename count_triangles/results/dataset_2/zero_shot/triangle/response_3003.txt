Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 0, 4>, <1, 0, 6>, <1, 0, 2>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 0>, <6, 0, 2>, <3, 7, 1>, <3, 7, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 2>.
