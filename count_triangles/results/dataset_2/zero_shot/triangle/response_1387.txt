Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) 

Response:

<1, 6, 5>
<1, 6, 12>
<3, 7, 11>
<3, 9, 11>
<5, 12, 14>
<9, 12, 14>
<2, 5, 8>
