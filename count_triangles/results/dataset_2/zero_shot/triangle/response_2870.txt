Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 17) (26, 22) (5, 11) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 3) (22, 26) (22, 23) (22, 16) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 29) (8, 23) (8, 19) (8, 28) (15, 20) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 16) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 11) (20, 10) (6, 22) (6, 27) (21, 3) (21, 12) (21, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 12) (29, 23) (29, 20) (3, 17) (3, 21) (3, 28) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 24) (19, 27) (28, 8) (28, 3) (28, 4) (4, 23) (4, 15) (4, 28) (4, 10) (11, 5) (11, 20) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 27) (24, 19) (24, 11) (24, 25) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 27) (7, 18) (25, 9) (25, 24) (25, 2) (2, 21) (2, 19) (2, 25) (2, 16) (13, 14) (18, 14) (18, 7) (16, 22) (16, 15) (16, 2) (10, 20) (10, 4) (27, 6) (27, 19) (27, 11) (27, 7) (12, 15) (12, 21) (12, 1) 

Response:
There are [44] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are: <1, 7, 14>, <4, 10, 20>, <4, 11, 24>, <15, 16, 22>, <2, 19, 27>, <4, 10, 27>, <3, 21, 12>, <7, 11, 27>.
