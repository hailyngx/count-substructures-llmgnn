Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
The unique triangles are <2, 7, 11>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 13>, <2, 10, 14>, <4, 6, 8>, <7, 9, 11>, <2, 7, 12>, <0, 1, 13>, <12, 13, 2>, <6, 8, 4>, <11, 14, 2>, <8, 11, 14>, <4, 12, 7>, <3, 11, 14>, <13, 1, 0>.
