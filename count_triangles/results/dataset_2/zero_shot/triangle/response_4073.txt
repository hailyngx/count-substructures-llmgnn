Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 9) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 6) (4, 16) (4, 10) (9, 17) (9, 12) (9, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 4) 

Response:
