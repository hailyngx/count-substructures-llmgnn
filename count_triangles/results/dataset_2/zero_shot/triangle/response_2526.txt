Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 14) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 4) (6, 8) (6, 11) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
There are total of [47] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <5, 0, 1>, <5, 0, 2>, <5, 0, 4>, <5, 0, 10>, <5, 1, 0>, <5, 1, 3>, <5, 1, 9>, <5, 2, 0>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 10>, <5, 11, 0>, <5, 11, 4>, <5, 11, 6>, <5, 13, 3>, <5, 13, 4>, <5, 13, 8>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 10>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 10>, <3, 10, 0>, <3, 10, 12>, <3, 13, 4>, <3, 13, 8>, <3, 12, 2>, <4, 0, 10>, <4, 0, 11>, <4, 2, 0>, <4, 2, 12>, <4, 2, 14>, <4, 11, 6>, <4, 11, 14>, <4, 14, 9>, <9, 1, 7>, <9, 4, 13>, <9, 7, 10>, <12, 2, 10>, <12, 2, 11>, <12, 3, 13>, <12, 10, 0>, <12, 10, 14>, <10, 0, 7>, <10, 3, 13>, <10, 14, 4>, <14, 4, 9>, <14, 8, 9>, <14, 8, 13>
