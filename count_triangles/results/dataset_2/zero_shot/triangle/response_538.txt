Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (2, 9) (2, 11) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6)
