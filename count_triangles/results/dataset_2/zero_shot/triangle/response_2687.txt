Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in this graph. Here they are listed below:
[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 5>]
