Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (7, 11) (7, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 12)
