Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 0>, <4, 5, 3>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 8, 1>, <4, 8, 9>, <0, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>.
