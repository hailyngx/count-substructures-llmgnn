Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 7, 5>.
