Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 19) (15, 8) (15, 19) (19, 18) (19, 15) (17, 6) (17, 8) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 16) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3)
