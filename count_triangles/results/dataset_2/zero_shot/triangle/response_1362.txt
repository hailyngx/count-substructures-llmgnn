Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 11) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 13) (12, 8) (12, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 13)
