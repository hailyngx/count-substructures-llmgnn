Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0)
