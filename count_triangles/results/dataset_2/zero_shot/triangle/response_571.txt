Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3)
