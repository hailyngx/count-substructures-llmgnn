Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are [12] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 4, 12>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 9, 10>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 7, 11>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 11>, <8, 12, 13>.
