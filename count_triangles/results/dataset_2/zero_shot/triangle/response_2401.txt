Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 10) (18, 5) (18, 2) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 15) (0, 5) (0, 6) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (19, 2) (15, 16) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (10, 2) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 4)
