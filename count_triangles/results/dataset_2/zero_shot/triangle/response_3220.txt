Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 14) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 11)
