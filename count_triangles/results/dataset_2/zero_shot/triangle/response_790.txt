Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 10) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 12) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 17) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 19) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 14) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 14) (0, 10) (16, 4) (16, 3) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 19) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [24]. 
The unique triangles found are <4, 15, 14>, <3, 16, 4>, <3, 12, 2>, <3, 11, 6>, <3, 12, 1>, <2, 18, 13>, <2, 12, 1>, <2, 12, 3>, <2, 17, 6>, <19, 14, 11>, <19, 14, 5>, <19, 8, 9>, <19, 8, 17>, <9, 18, 2>, <9, 18, 13>, <9, 10, 13>, <9, 10, 0>, <8, 19, 17>, <8, 19, 14>, <7, 6, 17>, <7, 6, 11>, <5, 15, 14>, <0, 13, 10>, and <0, 10, 9>.
