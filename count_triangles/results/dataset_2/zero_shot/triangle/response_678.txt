Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <5, 0, 1>, <5, 3, 13>, <9, 6, 7>, <9, 6, 10>, <9, 6, 11>, <9, 12, 2>, <13, 3, 10>, <13, 7, 0>, <0, 11, 1>, <0, 12, 3>, <6, 11, 0>, and <4, 1, 3>.
