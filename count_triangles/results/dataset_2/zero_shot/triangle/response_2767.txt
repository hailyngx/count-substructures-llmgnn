Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 14) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 12) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3)
