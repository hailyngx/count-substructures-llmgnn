Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 19) (21, 0) (21, 4) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 27) (9, 19) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 23) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 11) (20, 25) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 10) (8, 27) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 18) (27, 5) (27, 9) (27, 8) (27, 12) (27, 26) (6, 25) (6, 17) (6, 11) (16, 4) (16, 19) (7, 13) (7, 23) (7, 26) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 23) (26, 5) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 29) (2, 5) (2, 11) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 10) (17, 3) (17, 6) (0, 21) (0, 23) (29, 26) (29, 23) (29, 22) (10, 1) (10, 25) (10, 12) (10, 24) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 29) (22, 29) (18, 12) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 20) (14, 13) (14, 19) (19, 1) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <1, 10, 25>, <4, 12, 27>, <5, 9, 27>, <5, 14, 15>, <11, 15, 24>, and <19, 14, 20>.
