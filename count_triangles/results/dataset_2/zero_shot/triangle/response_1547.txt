Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 11) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles are: 
<3, 4, 0>
<9, 10, 14>
<9, 13, 10>
<7, 11, 1>
<7, 11, 3>
<12, 14, 10>
