Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 11) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 2) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 16) (7, 16) (7, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 11) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 5) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 13) (4, 9) (4, 19) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 6) (12, 13) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 2) (13, 12) (5, 11) (8, 17) (8, 18) (10, 16) (10, 19)
