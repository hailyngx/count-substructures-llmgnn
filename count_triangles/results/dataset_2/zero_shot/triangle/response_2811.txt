Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 24) (14, 15) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 19) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 9) (27, 25) (27, 5) (2, 18) (2, 23) (2, 24) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 29) (1, 12) (26, 8) (26, 4) (5, 27) (6, 7) (6, 22) (4, 18) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 25) (4, 29) (8, 26) (8, 4) (8, 24) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 25) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 13) (29, 0) (29, 18) (29, 4) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 20) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 9) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 22) (15, 13) (3, 10) (3, 21) (3, 12) (21, 3) (21, 24) (22, 6) (22, 11) (22, 15) (22, 20) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 11) (25, 19) (20, 16) (20, 22) (24, 14) (24, 0) (24, 2) (24, 8) (24, 21) (7, 6) (7, 28) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 23) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 12) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 25) (13, 28) (13, 10) (13, 15) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 9, 29>, <4, 25, 29>, <4, 25, 11>, <10, 13, 15>, <3, 12, 23>, <2, 18, 29>, <22, 15, 13>, <22, 11, 28>, <22, 11, 25>, <22, 11, 25>, <14, 16, 19>, and <14, 16, 19>.
