Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 6) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 9) (4, 8) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 18) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 15) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 18) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 19) (10, 2) (10, 14) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 19) (18, 9) (18, 13) (19, 6) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 17) (0, 11) (0, 12) (3, 2) (3, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (17, 4) (17, 5) (17, 19)
