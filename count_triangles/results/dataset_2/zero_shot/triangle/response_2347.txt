Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1)
