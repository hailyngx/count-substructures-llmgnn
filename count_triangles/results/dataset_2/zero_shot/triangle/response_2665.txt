Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 12) (15, 2) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 2) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 8) (18, 8) (18, 7) (12, 15) (12, 6) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (19, 11) (7, 18) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles are <0, 14, 13>, <0, 16, 5>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 1, 13>, <5, 8, 2>, <5, 0, 1>, <10, 11, 17>, <11, 9, 13>.
