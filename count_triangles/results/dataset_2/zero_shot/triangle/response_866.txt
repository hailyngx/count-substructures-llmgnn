Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 19) (10, 15) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 0) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 13) (13, 0) (13, 15) (18, 14) (18, 11) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 16) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 7) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 8) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 19) (12, 1) (12, 17) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [21].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 13, 15>, <1, 2, 17>, <1, 3, 17>, <2, 5, 14>, <2, 17, 12>, <3, 9, 17>, <6, 7, 8>, <10, 15, 19>, <11, 14, 18>, <14, 5, 16>, <15, 13, 0>, <15, 19, 10>, <16, 19, 5>, <0, 3, 1>, <4, 11, 14>, <6, 7, 14>, <6, 15, 13>, <12, 17, 2>.
