Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 7) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [30].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <6, 2, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 2, 9>, <14, 1, 5>, <0, 8, 13>, <13, 6, 8>, <0, 10, 3>, <0, 2, 10>, <4, 12, 9>, <13, 4, 12>, <5, 1, 10>, <10, 3, 5>, <4, 14, 2>, <14, 5, 1>, <10, 9, 2>, <7, 14, 9>, <7, 11, 14>, <11, 7, 14>, <6, 13, 2>, <3, 10, 5>, <3, 11, 7>, <8, 0, 13>, <1, 5, 14>, <3, 1, 14>, <8, 6, 13>, <9, 10, 2>, <8, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <8, 13, 0>, <5, 6, 10>.
