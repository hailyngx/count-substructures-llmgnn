Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
