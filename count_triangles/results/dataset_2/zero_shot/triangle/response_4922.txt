Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2)
