Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 11) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 9) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 3) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (15, 17) (15, 8) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 2) (7, 18) (7, 10) (7, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 13) (9, 0) (9, 4) (6, 17) (6, 18) (19, 2) (19, 10) (5, 11) (5, 7) (8, 1) (8, 15) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 19) (2, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 13) 

Response:
