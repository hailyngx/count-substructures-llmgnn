Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 19) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 8) (15, 8) (15, 12) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 2) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 16) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 17) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 19) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 0) (10, 5) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 17) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 6) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 4) (1, 16) (1, 0) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 8) (13, 9) (13, 2)
