Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9)
