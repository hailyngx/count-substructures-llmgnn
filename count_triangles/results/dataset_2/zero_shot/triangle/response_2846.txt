Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 10) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 7) (1, 14) (1, 13) (5, 15) (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (4, 17) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 12) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 16) (10, 6) (13, 1) (13, 18) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 13) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 8)
