Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 18) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 5) (8, 10) (8, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 19) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 5) (15, 2) (15, 7) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 15) (7, 17) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 18) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 6) (13, 14)
