Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 5) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 12>
<0, 7, 11>
<2, 9, 12>
<4, 6, 12>
<4, 9, 14>
<5, 10, 14>
<7, 9, 4> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
