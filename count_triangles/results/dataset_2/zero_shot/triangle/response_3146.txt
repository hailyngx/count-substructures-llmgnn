Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<5, 4, 12>
<5, 4, 14>
<5, 10, 9>
<5, 10, 2>
<5, 10, 11>
<5, 10, 2>
<5, 8, 1>
<5, 8, 2>
<9, 10, 2>
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 3, 14>
<12, 13, 1>
