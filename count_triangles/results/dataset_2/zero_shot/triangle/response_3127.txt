Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 18) (15, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (10, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 2) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (9, 17) (9, 4) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 17) (12, 11) (19, 7) (19, 16) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 16) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 8) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 2) (14, 5) (14, 7) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 18)
