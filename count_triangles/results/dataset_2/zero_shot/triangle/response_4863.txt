Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 18) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 2) (17, 11) (17, 0) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 14) (0, 15) (0, 17) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 3) (3, 6) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 4) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<1, 8, 13>
<1, 8, 15>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 15>
<1, 4, 6>
<5, 7, 14>
<9, 14, 19>
<13, 16, 18>
