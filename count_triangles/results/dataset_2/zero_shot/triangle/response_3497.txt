Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 2) (4, 18) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 14) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 17) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (1, 6) (3, 19) (3, 12) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 3) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 15) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 15) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 17) (10, 8) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 12)
