Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 5) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 2) (13, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (17, 6) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 6) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 15) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 3) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (15, 14) (15, 5) (10, 19) (10, 6) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 15) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [14].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
