Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 19) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 12) (10, 11) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 2) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 7) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 5) (6, 17) (6, 12) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 19) (9, 15) (9, 17) (19, 16) (19, 2) (19, 14) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 6) (14, 5) (14, 19) (7, 13) (7, 18) (7, 17)
