Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 14) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 18) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 6) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 6) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 19) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 10) (18, 12) (18, 10)
