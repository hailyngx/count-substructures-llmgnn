Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. They are as follows:
[<2, 5, 7> <2, 7, 8> <2, 7, 9> <4, 6, 7> <4, 8, 9>]
