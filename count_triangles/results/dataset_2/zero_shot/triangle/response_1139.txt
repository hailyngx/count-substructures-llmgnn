Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 18) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 18) (2, 17) (2, 5) (8, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 7) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 18) (9, 8) (9, 12) (15, 6) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 6) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (18, 1) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 16) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 16)
