Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14)
