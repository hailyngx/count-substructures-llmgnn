Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 10) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0)
