Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 0) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 14) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 16) (13, 17) (4, 6) (4, 12) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (7, 6) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 15) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 19) (11, 2) (11, 19) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 3) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 16) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 16) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 19) (10, 1) 

Response:
[<0, 5, 16> <1, 12, 19> <2, 3, 8> <2, 3, 11> <2, 16, 5> <3, 8, 19> <4, 12, 18> <5, 14, 15> <6, 7, 17> <8, 12, 1> <8, 12, 4> <8, 2, 16> <8, 3, 19> <12, 1, 8> <14, 15, 17> <17, 6, 14>]
