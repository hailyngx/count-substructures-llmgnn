Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 9) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 18) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 5) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 11) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 2) (19, 18) (19, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 5) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 2) (17, 12) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 15) (2, 3) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4)
