Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 9) (1, 3) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (8, 2) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 15) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (6, 18) (6, 19) (0, 16) (16, 18) (16, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 10) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 15) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 15) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 19) (19, 6) (19, 10) 

Response:
There are 20 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles found:
[<4, 12, 9> <10, 14, 4> <10, 19, 6> <15, 13, 11> <15, 9, 7> <18, 16, 0> <2, 8, 18> <3, 17, 13> <3, 7, 11> <3, 5, 14> <6, 19, 10>]
