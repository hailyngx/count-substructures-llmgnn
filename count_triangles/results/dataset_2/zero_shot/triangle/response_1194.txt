Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 3) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) 

Response:
