Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [14].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 10>, <0, 9, 10>, <1, 13, 14>, <2, 8, 12>, <3, 8, 12>, <3, 8, 14>, <3, 12, 13>, <4, 6, 9>, <7, 8, 12>, <7, 12, 13>, <9, 10, 14>.
