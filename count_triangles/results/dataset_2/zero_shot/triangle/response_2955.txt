Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 18) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 12) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 9) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 13) (16, 7) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 15) (12, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 4) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 17) (0, 3) (0, 17) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 17) (14, 1) (14, 2) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 11) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<2, 10, 14>
<4, 6, 18>
<4, 10, 11>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 9, 13>
<9, 15, 19>
