Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (7, 10) (8, 4) (8, 0) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 0) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 12) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 9) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 17) (6, 15) (6, 12) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 2) (14, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (12, 19) (12, 6) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12]. The unique triangles found are <4, 8, 18>, <9, 10, 15>, <0, 8, 16>, <1, 9, 17>, <1, 2, 5>, <4, 14, 18>, <2, 14, 17>, <11, 18, 19>, <6, 12, 19>, <6, 12, 15>, <2, 14, 18>, <4, 14, 18>.
