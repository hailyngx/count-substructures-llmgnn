Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 19) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 16) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 11) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 18) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 14) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 12) (10, 16) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 19) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 16) (12, 15) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 19) (0, 6)
