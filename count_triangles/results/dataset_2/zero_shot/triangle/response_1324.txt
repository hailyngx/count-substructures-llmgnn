Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 8) (9, 1) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 1)
