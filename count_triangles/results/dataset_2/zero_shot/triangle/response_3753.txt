Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 13) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 7) 

Response:

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 9, 14>
<5, 9, 7>
<1, 2, 14>
<1, 6, 10>
<3, 6, 11>
<7, 11, 13>
