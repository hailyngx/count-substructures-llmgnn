Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 12) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [4].
The unique triangles found are <4, 5, 12>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 12>, and <9, 10, 11>.
