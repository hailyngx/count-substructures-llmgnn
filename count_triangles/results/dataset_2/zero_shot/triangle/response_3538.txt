Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
[<0, 2, 9> <0, 2, 7> <0, 4, 9> <0, 4, 7> <1, 3, 6> <1, 3, 4> <1, 4, 6> <2, 3, 7> <2, 5, 9> <4, 5, 9>]
