Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0)
