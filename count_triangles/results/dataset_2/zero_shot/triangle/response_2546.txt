Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 2) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 9) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 4) (12, 18) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 5) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 7) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 17) (6, 15) (6, 7) (6, 17) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 6) (2, 15) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 13) (13, 3) (13, 18) (13, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 14) (10, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [52].
The unique triangles found are: <3, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 6>, <3, 7, 17>, <3, 7, 10>, <3, 7, 0>, <3, 7, 16>, <3, 7, 2>, <3, 7, 13>, <3, 9, 18>, <3, 9, 19>, <3, 9, 14>, <3, 9, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 17>, <3, 0, 5>, <3, 0, 16>, <3, 0, 17>, <3, 8, 1>, <3, 8, 19>, <3, 8, 4>, <3, 19, 4>, <3, 19, 8>, <3, 19, 18>, <3, 1, 11>, <3, 1, 2>, <3, 1, 8>, <3, 15, 2>, <7, 6, 17>, <7, 6, 15>, <7, 10, 17>, <7, 10, 10>, <7, 10, 9>, <7, 10, 7>, <7, 10, 3>, <7, 10, 14>, <7, 17, 17>, <7, 17, 6>, <7, 17, 0>, <7, 17, 5>, <7, 17, 18>, <7, 17, 4>, <7, 17, 9>, <7, 17, 13>, <7, 17, 2>, <7, 17, 16>, <7, 17, 11>, <7, 17, 14>, <7, 17, 1>, <7, 17, 8>.
