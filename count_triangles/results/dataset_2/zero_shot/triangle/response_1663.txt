Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 13) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 16) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (16, 14) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 4) (11, 14) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 17) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 2) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 13) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (9, 3) (9, 2) (6, 0) (6, 19) (10, 19) (10, 8) (18, 0) (18, 5) (18, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (8, 10) (13, 15) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 19)
