Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 14) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (2, 7) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:

<0, 1, 12>
<0, 7, 10>
<0, 7, 12>
<0, 10, 12>
<4, 10, 14>
<5, 13, 14>
<4, 9, 10>
<4, 9, 13>
<5, 13, 11>
<5, 13, 14>
