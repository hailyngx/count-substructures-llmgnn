Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12)
