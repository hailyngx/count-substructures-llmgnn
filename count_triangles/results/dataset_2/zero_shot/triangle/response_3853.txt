Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 10) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 4) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 4) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (3, 7) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 1) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 9) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 7) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 12) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 4) (18, 0) (12, 8) (12, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (4, 16) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6)
