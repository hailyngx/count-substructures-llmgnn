Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 17) (16, 13) (16, 14) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 15) (7, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 18) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 15) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 17) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 0) (15, 7) (15, 10) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 0) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 9)
