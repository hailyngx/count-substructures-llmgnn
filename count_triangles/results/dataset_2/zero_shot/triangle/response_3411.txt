Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 14) 

Response:
