Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 14) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (10, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 1)
