Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 0)
