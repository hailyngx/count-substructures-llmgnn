Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 15) (5, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 18) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (14, 12) (14, 16) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 17) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 18) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 6) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 6) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 13) (3, 5) (3, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (4, 0) (4, 17) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 16) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 15) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 8) (17, 4) (18, 11) (18, 8)
