Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 4) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 17) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 19) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 17) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 11) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 17) (3, 2) (3, 13) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 10) (8, 0) (8, 15) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 16) (1, 9) (10, 2) (10, 5) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12]. 
The unique triangles found are <4, 5, 17>, <4, 11, 17>, <4, 11, 19>, <4, 14, 18>, <5, 12, 19>, <5, 17, 18>, <7, 16, 18>, <7, 16, 17>, <7, 16, 1>, <7, 19, 12>, <11, 17, 19>, <16, 17, 18>.
