Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 6, 9>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 2>.
