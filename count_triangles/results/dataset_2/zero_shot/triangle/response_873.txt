Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 12) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 10) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 11) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 13) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 13)
