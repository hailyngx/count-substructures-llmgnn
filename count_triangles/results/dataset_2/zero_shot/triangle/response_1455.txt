Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [12].
Unique triangles found are: <2, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 4>.
