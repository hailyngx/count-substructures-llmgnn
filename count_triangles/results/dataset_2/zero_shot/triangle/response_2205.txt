Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 11>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 8, 14>, <1, 4, 13>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 14>, <2, 5, 13>, <3, 5, 13>, <4, 11, 12>, <4, 11, 14>, <4, 12, 13>, <4, 12, 14>, <5, 12, 13>, <8, 9, 10>, <8, 9, 14>.
