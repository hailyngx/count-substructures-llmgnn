Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<4, 6, 13>
<4, 6, 14>
<4, 12, 14>
<5, 9, 12>
<9, 14, 13>
