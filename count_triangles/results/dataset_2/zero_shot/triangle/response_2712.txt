Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
