Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0)
