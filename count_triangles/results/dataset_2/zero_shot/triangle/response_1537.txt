Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6)
