Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 25) (13, 10) (22, 4) (22, 16) (22, 15) (1, 29) (21, 27) (21, 12) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 27) (3, 25) (3, 23) (25, 13) (25, 3) (25, 15) (25, 11) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 24) (17, 19) (8, 19) (23, 3) (23, 5) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 18) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 28) (29, 1) (29, 26) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 2) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 18) (26, 29) (26, 24) (26, 5) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 28) (10, 20) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 10) (11, 25) (11, 19) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (7, 16) (7, 28) (16, 22) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 20) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 0) (28, 27) (28, 0) (28, 10) (28, 7) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 0) (5, 23) (5, 26) (18, 12) (18, 24) (18, 10) (20, 9) (20, 10) (20, 16) 

Response:
There are <6, 9, 27>, <6, 24, 27>, <6, 2, 12>, <6, 4, 24>, <6, 14, 16>, <6, 14, 19>, <6, 16, 22>, <6, 16, 20>, <6, 20, 10>, <9, 6, 27>, <9, 6, 24>, <9, 27, 24>, <9, 20, 10>, <12, 2, 18>, <12, 21, 27>, <12, 18, 24>, <14, 6, 16>, <14, 16, 19>, <14, 16, 20>, <17, 24, 27>, <17, 19, 16>, <17, 19, 11>, <19, 17, 16>, <19, 17, 24>, <19, 8, 11>, <20, 9, 10>, <20, 9, 16>, <20, 10, 28>, <20, 16, 22>, <23, 3, 25>, <24, 6, 27>, <24, 6, 4>, <24, 6, 14>, <24, 6, 2>, <24, 6, 17>, <24, 6, 18>, <24, 6, 28> triangles in total. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [38].
