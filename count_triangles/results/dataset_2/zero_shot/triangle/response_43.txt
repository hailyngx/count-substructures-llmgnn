Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 9) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 19) (4, 12) (18, 14) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 10) (5, 15) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 17) (13, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 10) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 11) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 9) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 0) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 6)
