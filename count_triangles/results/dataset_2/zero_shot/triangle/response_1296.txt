Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found inside <> are: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <7, 8, 1>.
