Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 13) (12, 10)
