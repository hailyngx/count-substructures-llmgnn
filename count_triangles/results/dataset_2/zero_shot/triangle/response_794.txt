Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [12].  
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <7, 9, 6>, <9, 2, 7>, <1, 0, 4>, <3, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <3, 5, 2>, <3, 1, 8>, and <2, 7, 9>.
