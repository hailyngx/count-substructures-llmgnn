Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 19) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 7) (5, 18) (5, 12) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (10, 3) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 19) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 12) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 15) (14, 7) (14, 19) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 19) (7, 18) (7, 14) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
There are [10] triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles are: 
<1, 3, 0>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 9, 8>
<1, 13, 17>
<3, 0, 2>
<3, 0, 15>
<3, 8, 9>
<13, 17, 11>
<17, 6, 11>
<17, 12, 19>
