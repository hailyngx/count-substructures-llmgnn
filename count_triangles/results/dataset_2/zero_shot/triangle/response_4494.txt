Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
There are 10 unique triangles in this graph. 

[<0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 9, 7>, <4, 1, 7>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 3, 5>, <4, 3, 1>, <4, 3, 2>, <4, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 5>]
