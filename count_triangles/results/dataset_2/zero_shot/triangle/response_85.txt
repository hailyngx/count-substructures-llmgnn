Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 14) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 15) (19, 0) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 15) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 15) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 14) (13, 10) (13, 12) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [12].
The unique triangles found are <2, 5, 6>, <3, 9, 14>, <4, 5, 6>, <7, 10, 14>, <7, 12, 15>, <7, 12, 18>, <10, 12, 13>, <12, 15, 16>, <12, 15, 17>, <12, 15, 14>, <12, 15, 18>, and <15, 14, 10>.
