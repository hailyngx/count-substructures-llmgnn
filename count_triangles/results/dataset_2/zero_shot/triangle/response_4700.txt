Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 5) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 2) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles are:
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 13>
<3, 4, 12>
<3, 12, 13>
<4, 7, 12>
<4, 12, 14>
<9, 10, 14>
<9, 11, 12>
<12, 14, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
