Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 4) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (1, 14) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 18) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 4) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 16) (4, 15) (4, 16) (4, 9) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 12) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 9) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 5) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 7)
