Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 5) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 7) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 6) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 9) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 1) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 19) (18, 13) (18, 7) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 16) (16, 14) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 2)
