Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 12) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles found are: <1, 5, 11>, <1, 9, 12>, <2, 3, 6>, <4, 7, 10>.
