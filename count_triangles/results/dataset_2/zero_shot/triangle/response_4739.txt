Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 12) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2)
