Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 16) (15, 12) (8, 19) (8, 7) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 17) (1, 16) (1, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 19) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 13) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 6) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [12].
The unique triangles identified are: 
<0, 10, 4>, <3, 9, 4>, <3, 12, 15>, <3, 4, 6>, <5, 1, 16>, <5, 3, 11>, <6, 3, 12>, <6, 4, 9>, <7, 6, 3>, <11, 16, 14>, <13, 17, 19>, <19, 18, 4>.
