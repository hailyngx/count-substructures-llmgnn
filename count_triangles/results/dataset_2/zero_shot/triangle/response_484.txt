Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 6, 8> 

So, the number of triangles is [4].
