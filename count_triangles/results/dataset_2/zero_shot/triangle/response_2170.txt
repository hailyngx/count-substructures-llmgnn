Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <5, 1, 9>, <5, 1, 2>, <5, 2, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <7, 1, 9>, <7, 1, 3>, <2, 0, 4>, <2, 0, 6>.
