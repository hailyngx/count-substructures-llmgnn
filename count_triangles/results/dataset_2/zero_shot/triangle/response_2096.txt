Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 5) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 15) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (1, 6) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 17) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 7) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (14, 3) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 19) (17, 15) (17, 9) (17, 3) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 8)
