Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2)
