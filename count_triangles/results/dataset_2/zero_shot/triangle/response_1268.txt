Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <4, 8, 9>.
