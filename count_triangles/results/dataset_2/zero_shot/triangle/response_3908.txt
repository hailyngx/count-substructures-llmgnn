Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 4) (10, 1) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 7) (7, 17) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 9) (9, 19) (9, 4) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 9) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (11, 5) (11, 19) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 13) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 18) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are <3, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <0, 13, 18>, <1, 6, 16>, <5, 11, 19>.
