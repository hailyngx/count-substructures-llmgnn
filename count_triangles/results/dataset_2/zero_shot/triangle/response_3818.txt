Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 14)
