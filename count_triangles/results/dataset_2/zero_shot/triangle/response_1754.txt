Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are total of [6] triangles in the graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 4>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 4>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 1>.
