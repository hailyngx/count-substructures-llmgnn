Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <5, 9, 4>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 4, 7>, <5, 4, 0>, <9, 6, 4>, <9, 6, 1>, <9, 1, 8>, and <4, 1, 6>.
