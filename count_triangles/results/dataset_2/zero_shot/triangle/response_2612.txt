Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 14) (15, 13) (15, 12) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 8) (16, 10) (16, 17) (18, 9) (18, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (6, 0) (6, 8) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 7) (19, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (8, 6) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 13) (13, 15) (13, 4)
