Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
The unique triangles are <1, 4, 8>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 4>, <2, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 0, 3>, <5, 7, 0>, <7, 9, 2>, <8, 1, 2>.
