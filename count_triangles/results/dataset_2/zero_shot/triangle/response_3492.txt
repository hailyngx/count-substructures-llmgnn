Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 6) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 7) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 18) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 9) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 18) (10, 15) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 16) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 1) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 19) (16, 13) (16, 15) (6, 13) (6, 15) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 12) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:

<4, 12, 1>
<5, 11, 19>
<5, 11, 12>
<5, 18, 19>
<6, 13, 9>
<8, 13, 9>
<8, 17, 2>
<13, 16, 15>
