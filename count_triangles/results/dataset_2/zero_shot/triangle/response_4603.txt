Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0)
