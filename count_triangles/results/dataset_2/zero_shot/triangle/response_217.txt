Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 7) (4, 18) (4, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 18) (1, 5) (1, 17) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 15) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (11, 13) (11, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 12) (3, 8) (3, 12) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 3) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: [14]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 18>, <0, 7, 18>, <0, 12, 14>, <0, 12, 9>, <2, 7, 18>, <2, 9, 15>, <3, 8, 13>, <5, 1, 17>, <5, 13, 11>, <6, 13, 15>, <6, 14, 12>, <6, 19, 15>, <8, 7, 2>, <10, 19, 15>
