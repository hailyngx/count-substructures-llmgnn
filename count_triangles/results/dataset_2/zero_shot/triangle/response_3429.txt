Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 9>.
