Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>] triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles is [16].
