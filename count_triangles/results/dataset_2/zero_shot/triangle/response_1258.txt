Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 9>
