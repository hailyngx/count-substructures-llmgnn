Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 15) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 7) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 15) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 16) (19, 2) (19, 11) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 13) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 6) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 14) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 15) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 15) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 4) (13, 18) (13, 0) (5, 4) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 4) 

Response:
