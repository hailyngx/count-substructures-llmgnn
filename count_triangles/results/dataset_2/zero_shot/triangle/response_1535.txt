Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 10)
