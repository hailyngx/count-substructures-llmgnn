Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 13) (12, 14) (4, 2) (18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 8) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 15) (19, 5) (8, 18) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 2) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (15, 5) (15, 16) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 2)
