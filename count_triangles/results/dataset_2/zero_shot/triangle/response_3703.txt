Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 13) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 11) (17, 14) (17, 0) (4, 19) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (18, 15) (18, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 16) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 13) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 13) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 5) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 1) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 16) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 12)
