Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 5) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 11) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 16) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 0) (17, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 18) (19, 16) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (14, 11) (7, 1) (7, 11) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 0) (12, 1) (12, 0) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 5) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 0) 

Response:
There are 28 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:
<3, 6, 1>, <3, 6, 13>, <3, 8, 13>, <3, 15, 5>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 10>, <1, 6, 12>, <1, 10, 4>, <11, 5, 16>, <4, 0, 17>, <4, 2, 10>, <0, 5, 16>
