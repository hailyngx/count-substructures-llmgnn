Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (2, 9) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 8) (8, 18) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 5) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 13) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 19) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 16) (7, 5) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 16) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 14>, <1, 5, 16>, <4, 12, 17>, <9, 14, 19>, <2, 9, 18>, <15, 16, 5>.
