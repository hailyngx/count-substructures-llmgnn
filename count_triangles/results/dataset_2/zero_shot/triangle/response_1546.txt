Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <1, 0, 3>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 7, 9>, <10, 11, 13>.
