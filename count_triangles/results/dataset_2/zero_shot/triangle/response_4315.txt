Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 15) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 16) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 13) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 9) (13, 1) (13, 12) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 10) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 15) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 9) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 5) (3, 14) (3, 8) (6, 8) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 12) (9, 17) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 5) (5, 0) (5, 11) (5, 10) 

Response:

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 18>
<1, 12, 13>
<1, 12, 17>
<2, 15, 16>
<4, 17, 11>
<8, 12, 16>
