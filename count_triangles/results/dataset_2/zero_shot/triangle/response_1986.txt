Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 18) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 18) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 16) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 19) (15, 7) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 4) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 18) (7, 10) (7, 15) (7, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 12) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 17) (13, 0) (13, 7)
