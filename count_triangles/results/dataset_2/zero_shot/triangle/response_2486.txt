Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 14) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<6, 9, 12>
