Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 15) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 19) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 12) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 17) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 17) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 4) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (18, 1) (18, 10) (4, 11) (4, 15) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 10)
