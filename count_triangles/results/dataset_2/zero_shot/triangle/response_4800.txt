Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 17) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (0, 16) (0, 14) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (4, 14) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 7) (17, 15) (17, 1) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 5) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 10) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [22].
The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 17>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 19>, <1, 7, 10>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 13, 7>, <1, 13, 17>, <1, 15, 17>, <1, 15, 9>, <1, 5, 19>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 6, 18>, <2, 8, 10>, <2, 8, 14>, <2, 8, 18>, <5, 6, 19>, <5, 7, 10>, <5, 1, 17>, <6, 7, 10>, <8, 9, 15>, <10, 3, 12>, <10, 6, 7>.
