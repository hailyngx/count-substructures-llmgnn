Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 11) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<1, 3, 6>
<4, 8, 7>
<9, 10, 13>
<9, 11, 13>
<11, 7, 4>
<12, 10, 14>
