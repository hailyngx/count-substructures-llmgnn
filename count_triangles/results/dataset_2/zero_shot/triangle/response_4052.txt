Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 19) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 16) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 11) (1, 10) (1, 18) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (8, 6) (8, 12) (16, 0) (16, 2) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 6) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 6) (17, 12) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 12)
