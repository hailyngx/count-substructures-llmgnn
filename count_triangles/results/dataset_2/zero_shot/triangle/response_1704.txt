Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles are:
<5, 9, 1>
<5, 9, 0>
<5, 1, 3>
<5, 1, 9>
<9, 1, 3>
<4, 7, 0>
<4, 7, 6>
<7, 0, 6>
<3, 1, 2>
<4, 8, 6>
