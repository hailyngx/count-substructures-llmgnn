Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (6, 2) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is: [12]
The unique triangles found are: <4, 1, 14>, <4, 1, 5>, <4, 10, 2>, <4, 10, 6>, <4, 10, 9>, <4, 10, 0>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 6, 14>, <4, 8, 12>, <2, 3, 13>, <14, 5, 12>, <14, 5, 13>.
