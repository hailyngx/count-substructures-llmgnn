Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 17) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 6) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 17) (1, 9) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (9, 1) (9, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 4) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 9) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 16) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 4) (16, 13) (16, 4)
