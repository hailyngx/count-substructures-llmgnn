Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 2) (17, 15) (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 19) (5, 16) (5, 17) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (18, 12) (18, 10) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 3) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 19) (0, 12)
