Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 1) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 12) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 10) 

Response:
There are 35 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are: <2, 4, 6>, <2, 9, 13>, <3, 7, 14>, <1, 10, 11>.
