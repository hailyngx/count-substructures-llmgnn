Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<1, 8, 9>  
<3, 7, 9>  
<4, 8, 9>  
<5, 7, 9>  
<5, 8, 9>  
<7, 8, 9>
