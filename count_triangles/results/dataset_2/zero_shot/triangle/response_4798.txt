Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 11) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 12)
