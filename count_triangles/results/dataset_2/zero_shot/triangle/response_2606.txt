Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 17) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 2) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 2) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (1, 16) (1, 15) (1, 4) (9, 15) (9, 17) (0, 11) (0, 10) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 5) (17, 3) (17, 4) (17, 9) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 12) (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 19) (12, 6) (12, 19) (19, 13) (19, 14) (19, 12)
