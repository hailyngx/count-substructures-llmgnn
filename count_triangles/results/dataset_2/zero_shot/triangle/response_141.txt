Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 9) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are <4, 1, 14>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 9, 11>, <4, 9, 14>, <0, 12, 11>, <0, 12, 14>, <2, 9, 14>, and <3, 5, 2>.
