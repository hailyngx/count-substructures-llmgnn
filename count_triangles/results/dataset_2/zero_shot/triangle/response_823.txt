Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 18) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 12) (15, 6) (15, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 17) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 14) (14, 11) (14, 16) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 17) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 19) (5, 8) (5, 4) (17, 15) (17, 0) (17, 19)
