Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 14) (4, 7) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 17) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 9) (2, 12) (2, 14) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 0) (15, 4) (15, 18) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 0) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (6, 18) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 0) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 3) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 3) (8, 10) (8, 18) (8, 1) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 19)
