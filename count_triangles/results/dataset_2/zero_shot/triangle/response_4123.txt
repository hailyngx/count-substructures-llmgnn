Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4)
