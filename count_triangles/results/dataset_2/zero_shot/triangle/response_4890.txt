Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1)
