Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <1, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <0, 2, 8>
