Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 10) (8, 16) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 2) (12, 17) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (0, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 10) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 17) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 14) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 13) (17, 12) (17, 15) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 14) (3, 18) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 13) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <6, 9, 11>, <4, 1, 16>, <4, 15, 17>, <2, 10, 19>, <7, 10, 13>, <7, 14, 19>, <14, 16, 19>, <9, 11, 18>.
