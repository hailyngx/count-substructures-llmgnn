Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 12) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 1) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) 

Response:
