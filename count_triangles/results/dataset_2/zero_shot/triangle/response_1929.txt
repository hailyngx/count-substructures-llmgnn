Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 1) 

Response:
There are <5, 9, 8>, <5, 1, 7>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 1, 3>, <9, 8, 4>, <9, 3, 4>, <8, 5, 6>, and <8, 5, 1> triangles in the graph. 

[There are 8 triangles in total]
