Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 1, 14>, <0, 6, 14>, <4, 10, 12>, <1, 2, 14>, <4, 10, 13>, <4, 11, 14>, <0, 13, 14>, <6, 9, 10>, <0, 5, 6>, <6, 10, 12>, <2, 7, 8>, and <7, 11, 13>.
