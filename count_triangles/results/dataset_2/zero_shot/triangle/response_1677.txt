Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (14, 7) (14, 17) (17, 14) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 16) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 16) (1, 7) (1, 19) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) (12, 10) (12, 5) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 13) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 13) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 18) (0, 1) (0, 9) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 9>
<3, 5, 11>
<3, 9, 11>
<6, 7, 15>
<6, 13, 18>
<7, 10, 14>
<13, 16, 18>
<15, 16, 18>
