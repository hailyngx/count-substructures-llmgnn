Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4)
