Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 19) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (2, 13) (18, 10) (18, 12) (1, 15) (1, 0) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 9) (8, 11) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 7) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 7) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 18) (12, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 9) (4, 13) (4, 9) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 4) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8)
