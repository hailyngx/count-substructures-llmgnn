Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 1) (14, 5) (14, 11) (17, 9) (17, 4) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 12) (15, 10) (15, 18) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 16) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 5) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (6, 12) (16, 13) (16, 4) (16, 7) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 16) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1)
