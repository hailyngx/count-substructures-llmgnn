Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 2) (4, 8) (4, 18) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 2) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 12) (13, 10) (5, 3) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 17) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 0) (0, 18) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (11, 14) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 9) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 12) (16, 19) (16, 10) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 19) (12, 9) (12, 17) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 16)
