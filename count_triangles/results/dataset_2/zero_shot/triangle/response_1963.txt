Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 19) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 8) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 16) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (13, 17) (13, 0) (13, 15) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 3) (3, 10) (3, 4) (19, 9) (19, 11) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 13) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 4)
