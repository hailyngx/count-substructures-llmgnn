Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are: <5, 9, 1>, <5, 9, 8>, <5, 9, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 1, 8>, <6, 9, 0>, <6, 4, 7>, <9, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 6>, <2, 6, 4>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
