Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 2) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (1, 17) (1, 9) (0, 4) (0, 17) (5, 11) (5, 19) (19, 7) (19, 5) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 18) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 8) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 6) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 2) (13, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
There are [10] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 4, 17>
<4, 6, 13>
<4, 6, 2>
<4, 9, 10>
<4, 9, 15>
<6, 8, 16>
<9, 10, 15>
<9, 13, 18>
<11, 16, 18>
<13, 15, 18>
