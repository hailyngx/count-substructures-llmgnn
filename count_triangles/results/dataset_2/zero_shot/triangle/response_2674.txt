Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) 

Response:

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<4, 6, 14>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 13>
<2, 6, 12>
<0, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 11>
