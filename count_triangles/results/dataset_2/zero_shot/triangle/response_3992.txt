Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 3) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
Unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 4, 14>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 13, 14>, <2, 3, 13>, <2, 9, 14>, <4, 8, 10>, <4, 10, 13>, <6, 12, 14>.
