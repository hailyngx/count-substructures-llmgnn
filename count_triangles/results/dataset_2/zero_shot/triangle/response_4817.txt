Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 11) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 3) (2, 1) (10, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 14>, <0, 7, 14>, <1, 6, 14>, <3, 4, 11>, <3, 4, 14>, <3, 11, 14>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 9, 12>, <4, 9, 13>, <6, 12, 14>.
