Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8)
