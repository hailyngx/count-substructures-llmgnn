Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 4) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 7) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 11) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (16, 13) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 1) (1, 18)
