Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of [26] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are: <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 11>, <2, 8, 11>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 11>, <6, 9, 12>, <6, 0, 2>, <9, 11, 12>, <9, 12, 4>, <9, 12, 7>, <9, 12, 1>, <5, 8, 10>.
