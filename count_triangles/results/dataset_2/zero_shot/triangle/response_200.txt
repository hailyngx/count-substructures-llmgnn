Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 15) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 14) (2, 7) (2, 14) (18, 13) (18, 1) (0, 19) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 8) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 5) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 1) (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 1) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 12) (17, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles: [4]
The unique triangles found: <1, 16, 11>, <1, 4, 11>, <5, 14, 2>, <8, 13, 19>
