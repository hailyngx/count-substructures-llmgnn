Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 12)
