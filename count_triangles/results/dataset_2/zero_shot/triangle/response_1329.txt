Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12]. 
The unique triangles found are as follows: 
<1, 10, 14>
<1, 10, 11>
<1, 11, 14>
<1, 11, 2>
<2, 7, 11>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 14>
<3, 9, 10>
<3, 7, 12>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 12>
<5, 6, 7>
