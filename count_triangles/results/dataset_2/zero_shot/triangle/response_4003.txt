Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 1) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 1) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 7, 10>, <2, 11, 13>, <2, 11, 14>, <2, 12, 13>, <2, 12, 14>, <2, 5, 11>, <3, 4, 10>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 8, 10>, <4, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 12>.
