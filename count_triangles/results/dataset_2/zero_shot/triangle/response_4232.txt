Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 13) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <1, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 10>, <2, 8, 10>, <2, 10, 12>, <2, 10, 14>, <3, 9, 10>, <5, 7, 14>, <6, 10, 12>.
