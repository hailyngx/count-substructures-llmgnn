Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5)
