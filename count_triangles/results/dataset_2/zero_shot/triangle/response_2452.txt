Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 9>.
