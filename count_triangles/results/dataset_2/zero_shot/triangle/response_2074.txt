Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles found are <3, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, and <1, 2, 5>.
