Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
There are [14] triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 6>, <5, 7, 0>.
