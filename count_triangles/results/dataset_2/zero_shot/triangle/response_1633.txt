Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 12) (2, 17) (2, 7) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 7) (8, 18) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 15) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 15) (15, 13) (15, 11) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 6) (0, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (6, 8) (6, 17) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 16) (14, 4) (14, 16) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 14) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 14)
