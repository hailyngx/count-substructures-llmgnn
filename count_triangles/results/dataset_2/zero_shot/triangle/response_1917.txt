Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 4, 8>, <0, 2, 5>, and <1, 2, 6>.
