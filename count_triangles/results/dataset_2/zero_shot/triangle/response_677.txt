Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14]. 
The unique triangles found are: <1, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 0, 3>, <1, 0, 5>, <1, 0, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <5, 6, 4>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 6, 1>, <7, 8, 5>.
