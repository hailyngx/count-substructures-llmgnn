Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [27].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 10, 2>, <0, 10, 4>, <0, 10, 12>, <0, 12, 9>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 7, 10>,...
