Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] triangles in the graph. The unique triangles found are as follows:
<5, 9, 6>
<5, 9, 4>
<5, 9, 1>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 4>
<5, 0, 3>
<5, 0, 8>
<9, 6, 2>
<9, 4, 6>
<1, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 1>
