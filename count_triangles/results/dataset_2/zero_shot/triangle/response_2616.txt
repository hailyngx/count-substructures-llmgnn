Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) 

Response:
