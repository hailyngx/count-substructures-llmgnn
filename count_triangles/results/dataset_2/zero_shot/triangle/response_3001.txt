Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 17) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (18, 19) (18, 5) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 15) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 9) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 8) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 15) (8, 16) (8, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 12) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 6) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 12) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [9]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 10, 6>, <0, 10, 2>, <0, 14, 11>, <3, 12, 9>, <7, 1, 4>, <7, 1, 17>, <9, 15, 12>, <11, 14, 8>, <15, 19, 18>.
