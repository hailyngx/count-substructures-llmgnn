Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 6) (10, 17) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 15) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 4) (18, 10) (18, 12) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 9) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 7) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 16) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 19) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 3) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 8) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 12) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9)
