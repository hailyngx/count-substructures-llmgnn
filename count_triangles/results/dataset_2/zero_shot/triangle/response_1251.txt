Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles are: <4, 7, 5>, <3, 1, 6>, and <3, 8, 2>.
