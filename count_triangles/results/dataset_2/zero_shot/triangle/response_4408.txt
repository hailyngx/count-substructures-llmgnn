Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 4) (22, 25) (0, 27) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 23) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 19) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 19) (6, 28) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (7, 12) (7, 17) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 21) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 16) (21, 12) (21, 24) (24, 21) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 15) (5, 19) (5, 26) (19, 28) (19, 29) (19, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 18) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 23) (20, 27) (20, 29) (10, 1) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 26) (15, 25) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 3) (26, 5) (26, 8) (26, 15) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 2) (25, 22) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 18) (11, 6) (11, 18) (2, 27) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 2) (23, 27) (23, 17) (23, 9) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 25) (18, 11) 

Response:
There are 18 triangles in the given graph as shown below:

[<1, 14, 17>, <1, 14, 16>, <1, 14, 18>, <1, 17, 25>, <1, 17, 15>, <1, 17, 18>, <1, 15, 25>, <7, 17, 15>, <7, 17, 25>, <8, 26, 15>, <8, 26, 25>, <8, 15, 25>, <2, 4, 22>, <2, 4, 27>, <20, 27, 29>, <6, 11, 18>, <6, 14, 16>, <6, 14, 1>]

There are total of 18 triangles in the graph.
