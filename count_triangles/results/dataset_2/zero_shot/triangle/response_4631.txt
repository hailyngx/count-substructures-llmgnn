Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 6) (17, 4) (17, 14) (17, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (12, 7) (12, 10) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 15) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 0) (5, 8) (5, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 6) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 6) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 19) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 1) (19, 16) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (9, 17) (9, 2) (9, 16)
