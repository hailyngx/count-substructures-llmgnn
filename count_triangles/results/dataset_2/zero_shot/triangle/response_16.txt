Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 15) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 16) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 3) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 7) (15, 5) (15, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 16) (10, 6) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 19) (7, 17) (16, 9) (16, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 13) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12)
