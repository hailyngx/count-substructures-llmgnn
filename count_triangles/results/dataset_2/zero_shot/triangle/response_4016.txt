Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles found: <1, 4, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <0, 1, 4>, <2, 6, 9>
