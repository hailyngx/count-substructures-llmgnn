Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 5) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12)
