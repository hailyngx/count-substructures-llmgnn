Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 1) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 10) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [40] triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
