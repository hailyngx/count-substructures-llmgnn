Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 12) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 15) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 20) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 20) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 9) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 5) (17, 27) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (28, 17) (28, 29) (28, 27) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 13) (29, 0) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 13) (21, 16) (21, 24) (7, 0) (12, 3) (27, 17) (27, 28) (27, 14) (0, 11) (0, 29) (0, 7) (0, 9) (9, 23) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 24) (14, 27) (14, 26) (14, 2) (14, 13) (26, 23) (26, 14) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 5) (1, 25) (1, 22) (1, 4) (1, 6) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 29) (19, 13) (15, 25) (15, 23) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 14) (13, 29) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 19) (5, 17) (5, 16) (24, 23) (24, 21) (24, 9) (24, 20) (20, 11) (20, 22) (20, 24) 

Response:
There are a total of [36] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 11, 29>, <0, 9, 24>, <1, 6, 13>, <1, 6, 22>, <1, 6, 25>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 22, 25>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 9, 14>, <2, 9, 23>, <2, 11, 14>, <2, 11, 20>, <2, 14, 13>, <3, 12, 25>, <3, 8, 25>, <3, 8, 12>, <5, 16, 17>, <5, 16, 21>, <5, 17, 28>, <5, 17, 27>, <6, 13, 19>, <10, 19, 22>, <10, 19, 29>, <11, 20, 22>, <13, 14, 29>, <15, 23, 25>, <16, 21, 24>, <17, 27, 28>, <19, 22, 29>, <19, 13, 22>, <20, 22, 24>, <20, 24, 23>, <20, 24, 21>, <23, 24, 26>, <23, 24, 9>, <26, 24, 21>.
