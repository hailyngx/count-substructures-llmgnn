Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 12) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 1) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<2, 8, 10>, <2, 8, 1>, <2, 10, 8>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <3, 4, 10>, <3, 10, 7>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 9, 12>, <6, 1, 12>.
