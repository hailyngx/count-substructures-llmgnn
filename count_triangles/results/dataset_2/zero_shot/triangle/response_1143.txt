Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 7>.
