Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (8, 3) (8, 17) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 13) (1, 15) (1, 2) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 5) (13, 18) (13, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 19) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 19) (6, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 18) (7, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 15) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 12) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 12) 

Response:
