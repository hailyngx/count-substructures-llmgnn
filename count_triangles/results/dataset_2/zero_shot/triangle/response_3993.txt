Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 17) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 13) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 19) (13, 9) (13, 5) (19, 12) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 0) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 10) (14, 5) (10, 3) (10, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 17)
