Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
[<0, 2, 8> <0, 3, 8> <0, 4, 8> <0, 8, 9> <1, 2, 3> <1, 2, 5> <1, 3, 5> <2, 3, 8> <4, 7, 8> <6, 7, 9>]
