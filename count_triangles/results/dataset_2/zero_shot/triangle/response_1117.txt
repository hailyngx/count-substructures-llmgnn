Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 17) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 4) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 16) (4, 2) (4, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 15) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 15) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 6) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 12) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 14) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 12) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (16, 18) (16, 13) (12, 10) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 12)
