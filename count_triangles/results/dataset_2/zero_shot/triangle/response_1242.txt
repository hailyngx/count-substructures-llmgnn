Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 9) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 9) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 6) (2, 7) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11)
