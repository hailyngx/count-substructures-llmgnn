Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 19) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 13) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 7) (4, 9) (4, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 19) (7, 18) (7, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 6) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 14) (16, 12) (3, 5) (3, 12) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 11) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 0) (15, 13) (15, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 15, 13>, <0, 15, 1>, <0, 19, 10>, <2, 13, 6>, <2, 13, 8>, <2, 18, 7>, <4, 9, 14>, <5, 10, 9>, <5, 10, 6>, <6, 10, 9>, <6, 11, 4>.
