Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 1>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 7, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 7>.
