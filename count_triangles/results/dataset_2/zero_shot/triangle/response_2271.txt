Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 0>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 0>, <7, 8, 9>.
