Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 22) (21, 3) (21, 29) (21, 14) (18, 22) (18, 24) (18, 25) (18, 29) (22, 1) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 20) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 17) (13, 5) (17, 5) (17, 20) (17, 2) (20, 22) (20, 17) (20, 3) (20, 6) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 27) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 23) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 14) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 4) (28, 24) (14, 21) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 8) (14, 29) (25, 18) (25, 27) (25, 16) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 25) (27, 2) (6, 20) (6, 19) (24, 18) (24, 28) (24, 9) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 12) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 14) (7, 9) (11, 9) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 14) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 19) (0, 26) (9, 24) (9, 7) (9, 11) (12, 3) (12, 19) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 27) (2, 11) (4, 3) (4, 28) (4, 23) (23, 10) (23, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [52]. The unique triangles found are <2, 4, 23>, <2, 4, 27>, <2, 11, 23>, <2, 11, 27>, <3, 21, 29>, <3, 20, 27>, <3, 20, 12>, <3, 4, 28>, <5, 13, 17>, <5, 13, 8>, <5, 17, 2>, <5, 17, 20>, <8, 15, 10>, <8, 15, 14>, <8, 15, 10>, <8, 14, 29>, <8, 14, 15>, <9, 7, 11>, <9, 7, 24>, <9, 11, 2>, <10, 15, 14>, <10, 15, 8>, <10, 23, 4>, <10, 23, 8>, <16, 19, 12>, <16, 19, 6>, <18, 22, 16>, <18, 22, 20>, <18, 22, 1>, <18, 25, 27>, <18, 25, 16>, <18, 25, 22>, <18, 29, 21>, <18, 29, 14>, <18, 29, 21>, <20, 17, 2>, <20, 17, 22>, <20, 17, 5>, <20, 3, 21>, <24, 28, 4>, <24, 28, 27>, <24, 28, 26>, <24, 9, 11>, <24, 9, 7>, <24, 9, 11>, <25, 27, 16>, <25, 27, 3>, <25, 27, 4>, <26, 14, 21>, <26, 14, 15>, <27, 2, 11>, <27, 2, 17>, <27, 3, 12>.
