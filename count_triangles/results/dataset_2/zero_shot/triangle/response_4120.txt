Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 16) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 18) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 0) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 17) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 16) (2, 7) (2, 15) (2, 17) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 14) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 18) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 16) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 19) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 6, 10>
<1, 13, 19>
<0, 11, 15>
<0, 15, 14>
<7, 19, 13>
<14, 15, 19>
