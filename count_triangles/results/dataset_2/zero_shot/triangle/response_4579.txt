Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The triangles found are: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 7, 9>.
