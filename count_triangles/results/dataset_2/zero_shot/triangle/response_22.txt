Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <5, 9, 6>, <5, 9, 4>, <5, 9, 8>, <5, 4, 2>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 3, 7>, <9, 6, 8>, <9, 4, 2>, <9, 7, 8>, <4, 2, 3>, <6, 3, 0>, <7, 1, 0>.
