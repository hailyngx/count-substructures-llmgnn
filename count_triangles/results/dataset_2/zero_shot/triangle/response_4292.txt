Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 13) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 7) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 1) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 17) (18, 19) (18, 8) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 13) (8, 16) (8, 18) (2, 9) (2, 13) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 4) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 4) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 unique triangles in the given graph.

The triangles found are:
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 7, 15>
<0, 7, 17>
<1, 4, 17>
<2, 9, 13>
<3, 12, 6>
<9, 13, 6>
<11, 12, 16>
<11, 14, 16>

So, there are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
