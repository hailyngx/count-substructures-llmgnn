Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 4) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 6) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6)
