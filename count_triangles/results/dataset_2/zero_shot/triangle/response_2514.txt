Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 9) (7, 13) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 12) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 5) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 5) (5, 16) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 19) (15, 7) (15, 18) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 12) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 15) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 16) 

Response:
