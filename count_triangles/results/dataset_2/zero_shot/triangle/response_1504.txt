Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 15) (1, 7) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 5) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 0) (9, 18) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 5) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 6) (2, 10) (2, 6) (19, 13) (19, 4) (19, 14) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 5) (14, 12) (14, 19) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 18) (6, 2)
