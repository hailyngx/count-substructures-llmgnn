Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 6) (8, 9) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 19) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 14) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 6) (5, 2) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. 

Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 7, 17>
<0, 13, 17>
<0, 13, 12>
<6, 1, 19>
