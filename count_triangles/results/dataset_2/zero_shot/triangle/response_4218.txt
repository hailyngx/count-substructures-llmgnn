Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 3) (4, 15) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 17) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 3) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 18) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 0) (15, 4) (15, 2) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 8) (13, 17) (13, 16) (0, 19) (0, 16) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (14, 11) (14, 19) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 16) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 1) (18, 6) (18, 3)
