Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (16, 5) (14, 18) (14, 19) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 18) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 18) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 0) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 5) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 8) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 3) (19, 14) (4, 9) (13, 11) (5, 16) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 15)
