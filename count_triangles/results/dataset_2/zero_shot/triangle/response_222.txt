Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 8, 4>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 0>, <3, 4, 8>.
