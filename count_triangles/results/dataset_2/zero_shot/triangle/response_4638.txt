Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 16) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 17) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 0) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 19) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 2) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 18) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 18) (16, 4) (16, 1) (11, 14) (11, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 3) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 13) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 11)
