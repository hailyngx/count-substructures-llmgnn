Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 15) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 13) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 15) (18, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (5, 7) (5, 17) (19, 6) (19, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 11) (13, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 18) 

Response:
