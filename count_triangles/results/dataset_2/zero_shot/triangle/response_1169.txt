Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 15) (8, 17) (8, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 6) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 14) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 1) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 12) (19, 0) (19, 12) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 16) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (7, 16) (3, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 14) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 15) (12, 19) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 9)
