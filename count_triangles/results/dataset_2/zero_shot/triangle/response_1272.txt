Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 13) (11, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 14) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4)
