Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
There are [12] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are <4, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 11>, <0, 7, 14>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 10, 13>, <4, 10, 12>, <4, 13, 14>, <5, 8, 10>, <5, 8, 14>, <5, 12, 13>, <7, 11, 14>.
