Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are total of [12] triangles in the given graph.  

The unique triangles are as follows:
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 11, 13>
<2, 3, 14>
<3, 7, 11>
<4, 10, 11>
<4, 11, 13>
<4, 12, 14>
<7, 9, 12>
<8, 9, 13>
<9, 12, 14>
<10, 11, 14>
<11, 13, 14>
