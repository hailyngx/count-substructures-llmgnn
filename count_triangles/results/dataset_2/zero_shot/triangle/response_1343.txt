Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 10) (15, 27) (15, 9) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 3) (1, 21) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 2) (7, 24) (7, 17) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 0) (22, 12) (10, 16) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 13) (17, 7) (17, 10) (2, 11) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 4) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 14) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 25) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 28) (4, 3) (26, 5) (28, 4) (28, 8) (28, 20) (5, 26) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 20) (8, 16) (8, 28) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 22) (19, 23) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 3) (6, 10) (25, 14) (25, 23) (20, 28) (20, 13) (3, 27) (3, 18) (3, 4) (3, 23) (24, 7) (24, 0) (24, 12) (12, 1) (12, 22) (12, 24) (29, 16) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph. 

[12]

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 18>, <0, 14, 25>, <2, 4, 18>, <4, 18, 3>, <10, 16, 21>, <10, 16, 17>, <10, 16, 13>, <13, 20, 5>, <18, 4, 3>, <18, 4, 28>, <22, 19, 23>
