Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 13) (16, 8) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 16) (13, 14) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 19) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 12) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 1) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 15) (3, 14) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 1) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 19) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (14, 13) (14, 3) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 19) 

Response:
[<0, 4, 18> <2, 4, 19> <2, 5, 19> <4, 9, 18> <8, 10, 17> <8, 11, 18> <8, 17, 10> <8, 17, 12>]
