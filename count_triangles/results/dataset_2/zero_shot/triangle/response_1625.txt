Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 10) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 11) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14)
