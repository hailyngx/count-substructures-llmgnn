Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 1)
