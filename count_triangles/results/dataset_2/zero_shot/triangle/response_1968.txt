Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (12, 11) (12, 1) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [28].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 14>, <1, 8, 13>, <1, 8, 7>, <1, 12, 14>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 3>, <3, 6, 11>, <3, 6, 10>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <8, 6, 10>, <8, 6, 7>, <8, 6, 3>, <8, 6, 1>, <8, 7, 10>, <8, 7, 3>, <8, 7, 2>, <8, 13, 1>, <10, 6, 11>, <13, 14, 8>, <13, 14, 3>, and <13, 14, 1>.
