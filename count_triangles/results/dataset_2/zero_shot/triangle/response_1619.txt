Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 23) (16, 9) (16, 19) (15, 27) (15, 4) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 21) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 22) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 29) (12, 9) (12, 3) (23, 16) (23, 21) (23, 10) (0, 7) (0, 25) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 7) (6, 0) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 18) (28, 6) (28, 4) (28, 24) (19, 16) (19, 24) (26, 5) (26, 29) (26, 21) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (4, 15) (4, 28) (4, 22) (4, 25) (4, 20) (22, 5) (22, 4) (22, 10) (22, 17) (24, 6) (24, 28) (24, 19) (24, 3) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 29) (1, 29) (29, 13) (29, 26) (29, 18) (29, 1) (21, 15) (21, 27) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 26) (20, 4) (3, 12) (3, 24) (3, 2) (25, 0) (25, 4) (17, 22) (10, 23) (10, 22) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3)
