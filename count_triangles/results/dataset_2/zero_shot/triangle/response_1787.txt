Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0)
