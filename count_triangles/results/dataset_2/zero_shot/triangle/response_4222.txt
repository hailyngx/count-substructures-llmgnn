Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles are: 
<5, 8, 1>
<2, 6, 0>
<2, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 0>
