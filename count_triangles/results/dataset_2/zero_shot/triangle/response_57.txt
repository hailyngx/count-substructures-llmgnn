Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (14, 13) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 19) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 18) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 2) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 4) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 18) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 18) (1, 8) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (18, 13) (18, 15) (18, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0)
