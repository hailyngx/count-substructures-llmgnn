Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [9].
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 10>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 5>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 13>, <8, 11, 14>, <10, 13, 14>.
