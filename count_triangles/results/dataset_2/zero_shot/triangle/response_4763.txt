Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [18]. The unique triangles found are as follows: <5, 9, 11>, <5, 9, 6>, <5, 9, 2>, <5, 4, 14>, <5, 7, 11>, <5, 7, 6>, <5, 1, 4>, <5, 1, 7>, <5, 1, 14>, <5, 1, 0>, <9, 7, 8>, <9, 6, 13>, <7, 4, 1>, <7, 3, 1>, <3, 4, 1>, <6, 0, 12>, <6, 2, 0>, <11, 10, 3>.
