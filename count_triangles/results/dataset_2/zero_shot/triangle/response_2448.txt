Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 17) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 15) (17, 10) (17, 3) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 6) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 3) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (0, 4) (0, 18) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 2) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 19) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 16) (7, 18) (7, 13) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 16) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 14) 

Response:
There are [26] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <2, 4, 12>, <6, 13, 18>, <8, 15, 16>, <9, 12, 10>, <9, 14, 19>.
