Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 16) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 8) (17, 1) (15, 19) (15, 2) (15, 16) (3, 6) (3, 18) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 16) (2, 14) (2, 15) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (18, 3) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 19) 

Response:
There are [(number)] triangles in the graph.
