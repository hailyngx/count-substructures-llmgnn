Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, and <0, 4, 6>.
