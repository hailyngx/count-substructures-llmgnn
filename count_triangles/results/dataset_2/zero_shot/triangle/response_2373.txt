Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [18].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 2, 4>, <5, 4, 6>, <6, 3, 8>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 5, 4>, <6, 5, 8>, <7, 8, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 9, 4>, <8, 3, 6>.
