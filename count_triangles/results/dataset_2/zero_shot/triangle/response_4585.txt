Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 1) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 1) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 9) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 9) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 5) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 14) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 14) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 12) (2, 1) (2, 16) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [2].
The unique triangles found are: <4, 1, 15> and <9, 18, 19>.
