Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (6, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 10) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11)
