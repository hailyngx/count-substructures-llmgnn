Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <2, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, and <5, 6, 8>.
