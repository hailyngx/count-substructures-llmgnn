Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 6) (27, 26) (27, 13) (14, 28) (14, 19) (14, 4) (17, 19) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 2) (20, 5) (9, 15) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 13) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 8) (11, 24) (11, 21) (28, 14) (28, 24) (28, 10) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 20) (7, 0) (7, 26) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 23) (29, 9) (2, 20) (2, 12) (2, 6) (18, 3) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 24) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 26) (10, 28) (10, 26) (10, 8) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 12) (26, 10) (24, 11) (24, 28) (24, 19) (24, 13) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 23) (21, 11) (21, 12) (21, 5) (21, 4) (3, 0) (3, 18) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 14) (4, 22) (4, 21) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 20) (5, 21) (5, 8) (8, 22) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 5) (23, 1) (23, 16) (13, 27) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 24) (13, 16) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [30]. The unique triangles found are <1, 13, 16>, <4, 6, 21>, <8, 10, 26>.
