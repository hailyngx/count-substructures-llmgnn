Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 13) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 17) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 5) (1, 0) (1, 19) (17, 15) (17, 13) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 10) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 10) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 8) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 8) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 12) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 6) (12, 3) (12, 19) (10, 13) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 19) 

Response:
There are 21 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 4, 16>, <0, 13, 17>, <0, 13, 10>, <0, 13, 9>, <1, 19, 15>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 11, 18>, <3, 12, 19>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 16>, <8, 10, 19>.
