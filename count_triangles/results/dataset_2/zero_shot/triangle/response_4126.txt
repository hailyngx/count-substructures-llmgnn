Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (6, 17) (6, 7) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 18) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (10, 16) (10, 8) (17, 6) (17, 15) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 15) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 2) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 14) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 15)
