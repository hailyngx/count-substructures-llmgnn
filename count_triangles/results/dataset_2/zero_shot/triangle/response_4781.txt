Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are [9] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 1>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 2>.
