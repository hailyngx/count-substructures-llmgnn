Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
