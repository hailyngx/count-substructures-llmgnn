Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph, here they are listed uniquely:
[<0, 1, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 2>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 1>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 8, 4>, <6, 8, 3>]
