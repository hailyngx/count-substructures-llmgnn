Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (17, 8) (17, 7) (5, 15) (5, 0) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 1) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (19, 8) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 16) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 15) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 1) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 13) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 14) (15, 5) (15, 2) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 13)
