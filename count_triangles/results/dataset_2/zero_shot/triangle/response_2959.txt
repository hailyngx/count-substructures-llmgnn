Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 2) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 17) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 6) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 9) (10, 4) (10, 15) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 13) (12, 4) (12, 9) (2, 16) (2, 13) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 13) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 8) (3, 19) (3, 8) (14, 18) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 12) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 6) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 3)
