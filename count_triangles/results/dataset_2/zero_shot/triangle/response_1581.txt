Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 3) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 16) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (11, 17) (11, 1) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 5) (14, 8) (15, 7) (16, 4) (16, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [26].
The unique triangles are: <3, 10, 17>, <3, 13, 17>, <3, 13, 2>, <3, 13, 0>, <3, 0, 12>, <3, 0, 1>, <3, 12, 1>, <4, 7, 18>, <4, 7, 16>, <7, 8, 16>, <7, 8, 10>, <8, 14, 5>, <8, 14, 16>, <8, 14, 5>, <8, 14, 16>, <12, 17, 13>, <12, 17, 11>, <13, 17, 11>, <13, 17, 12>, <1, 12, 11>, <1, 12, 0>, <1, 12, 11>, <1, 12, 0>, <13, 6, 0>, <13, 6, 17>, <13, 6, 2>.
