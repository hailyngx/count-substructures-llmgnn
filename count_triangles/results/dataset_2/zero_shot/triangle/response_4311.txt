Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 0, 4>, <7, 2, 9>.
