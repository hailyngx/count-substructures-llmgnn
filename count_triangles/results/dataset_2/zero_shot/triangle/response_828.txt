Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 10)
