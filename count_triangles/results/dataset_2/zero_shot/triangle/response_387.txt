Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10)
