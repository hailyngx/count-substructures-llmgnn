Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 7) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 12)
