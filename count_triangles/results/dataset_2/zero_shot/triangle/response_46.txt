Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 10)
