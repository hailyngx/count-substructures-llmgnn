Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 11) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 3) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 4) 

Response:
There are <5, 7, 11> and <3, 4, 11> triangles in the given graph. 
The total number of triangles is [2].
