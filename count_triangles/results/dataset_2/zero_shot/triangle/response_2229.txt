Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <4, 7, 3>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 3>.
