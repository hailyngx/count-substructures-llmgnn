Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph. 

Unique triangles:
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [15].
