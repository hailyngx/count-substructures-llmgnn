Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 14) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7)
