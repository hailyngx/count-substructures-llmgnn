Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 9) (16, 18) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 6) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 0) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 5) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 13) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 13) (9, 11) (9, 0) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 8) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 18) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 18) 

Response:
There are [28] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are <0, 1, 14>, <0, 1, 19>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 5>, <1, 14, 13>, <1, 14, 17>, <2, 10, 3>, <2, 12, 5>, <2, 12, 13>, <3, 10, 8>, <3, 10, 11>, <3, 15, 0>, <3, 15, 16>, <5, 6, 3>, <5, 6, 12>, <5, 6, 19>, <8, 10, 2>, <8, 14, 17>, <8, 14, 1>, <9, 11, 10>, <9, 11, 0>, <12, 4, 5>, <12, 4, 7>, <13, 14, 8>, <13, 14, 19>, <15, 0, 7>, <15, 0, 19>, <17, 3, 10>.
