Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12]. 
The unique triangles are <4, 6, 13>, <4, 6, 14>, <4, 7, 14>, <4, 13, 5>, <6, 9, 13>, <6, 2, 14>, <6, 11, 13>, <0, 8, 12>, <0, 10, 4>, <2, 8, 1>, <2, 13, 3>, <5, 1, 3>.
