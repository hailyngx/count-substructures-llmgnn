Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0)
