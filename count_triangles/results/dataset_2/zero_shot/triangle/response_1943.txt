Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 12) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12)
