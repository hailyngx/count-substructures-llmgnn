Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 15) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 18) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 4) (10, 11) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 4) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 5) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 1) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 15) (9, 18) (9, 1) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 19) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 6) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 6) (5, 11) (5, 18) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles are as follows:
<11, 16, 12>
<8, 13, 4>
<8, 13, 1>
<8, 12, 3>
<10, 2, 18>
<6, 17, 18>
<6, 19, 11>
<6, 19, 14>
