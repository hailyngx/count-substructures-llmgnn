Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 13) (1, 2) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 16) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 4) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 13) (16, 7) (11, 2) (11, 1) (14, 18) (14, 13) (3, 6) (3, 19) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 6) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 19) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found are <4, 6, 8>, <4, 10, 6>, <4, 10, 8>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 0, 12>, <4, 6, 12>, <7, 0, 12>, <7, 9, 12>, <10, 5, 15>, <11, 1, 2>, <13, 14, 18>, <13, 15, 18>.
