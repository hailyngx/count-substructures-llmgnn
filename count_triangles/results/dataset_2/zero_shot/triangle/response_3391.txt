Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 2) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 11) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<4, 13, 8>
<1, 4, 0>
<8, 0, 11>
<3, 2, 10>
<6, 9, 14>
<2, 8, 12>
<0, 1, 11>
<5, 10, 13>
<2, 10, 3>
<7, 8, 9>
