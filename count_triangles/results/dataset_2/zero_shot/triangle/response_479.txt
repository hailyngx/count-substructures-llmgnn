Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 4) (16, 19) (16, 14) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 3) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 14) (5, 7) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (17, 12) (17, 1) (17, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (9, 17) (9, 8) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 19) (15, 18) (15, 13) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 15) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8)
