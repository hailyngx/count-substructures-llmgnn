Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 17) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 1) (0, 19) (3, 12) (11, 7) (5, 12) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 15) (4, 17) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 15) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 16) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 17) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 18) (19, 0) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 14) (16, 1) (16, 6) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 14) (18, 15) (18, 10) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10)
