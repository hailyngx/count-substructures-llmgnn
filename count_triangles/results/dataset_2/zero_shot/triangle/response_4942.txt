Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (17, 8) (17, 21) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 16) (8, 21) (23, 2) (23, 9) (23, 19) (15, 20) (15, 6) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 19) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 27) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 27) (26, 0) (26, 12) (1, 4) (1, 19) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 6) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 2) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 21) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 3) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 3) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 14) (29, 21) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 13) (21, 11) (21, 29) (2, 23) (2, 26) (2, 25) (2, 16) (2, 9) (9, 23) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 26) (12, 9) (12, 14) (27, 13) (27, 26) (27, 24) (14, 24) (14, 12) (22, 11) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (19, 23) (19, 20) (19, 1)
