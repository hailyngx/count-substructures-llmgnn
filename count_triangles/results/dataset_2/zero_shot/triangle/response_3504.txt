Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <0, 1, 4>.
