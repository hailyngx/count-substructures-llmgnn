Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (10, 12) (10, 19) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 4) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 16) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 16) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 19) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 18) (2, 14) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 6) (6, 14) (6, 0) (15, 16) (15, 0) (17, 8) (17, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8)
