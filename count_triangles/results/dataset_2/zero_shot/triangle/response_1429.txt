Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (13, 7) (13, 3) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 10) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12)
