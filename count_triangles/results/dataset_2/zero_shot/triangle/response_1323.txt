Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is : [11]
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 8, 3>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 6, 2>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 0, 8>, <4, 6, 2>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, <8, 1, 6>
