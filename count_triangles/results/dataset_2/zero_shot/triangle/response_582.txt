Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 6) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 7) (15, 17) (15, 11) (12, 5) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 13) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 5) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 16) (11, 1) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (0, 11) (0, 17) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 9) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 11) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

1. <4, 8, 16>
2. <4, 13, 14>
3. <1, 7, 9>
4. <11, 15, 17>
5. <11, 0, 17>
6. <6, 11, 16>
7. <4, 14, 19>
8. <7, 10, 14>
