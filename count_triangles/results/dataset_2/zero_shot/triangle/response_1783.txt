Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 12) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 14)
