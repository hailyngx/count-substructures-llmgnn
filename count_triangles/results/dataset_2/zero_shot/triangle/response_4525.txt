Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 26) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 11) (12, 27) (12, 16) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 17) (26, 0) (26, 25) (26, 7) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 23) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (17, 22) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 7) (3, 2) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 8) (21, 18) (10, 1) (10, 7) (15, 19) (11, 27) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 29) (20, 21) (20, 8) (29, 23) (29, 14) (29, 4) (28, 0) (28, 19) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 16) (16, 12) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 5) (18, 9) (18, 21) (18, 6) (4, 22) (4, 11) (4, 29) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 25) (6, 18) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 26) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 6) (24, 0) (24, 25) (8, 1) (8, 21) (8, 20) (8, 16) (8, 6) (25, 26) (25, 19) (25, 24) (13, 14) (5, 22) (5, 16) (14, 9) (14, 29) (14, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 5. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 1>, <1, 8, 21>, <4, 22, 5>, <9, 18, 21>, and <14, 29, 13>.
