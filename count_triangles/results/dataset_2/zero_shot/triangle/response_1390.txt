Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 2) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. 

[10]

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 4, 8>
<0, 8, 13>
<2, 4, 11>
<4, 5, 14>
<4, 6, 10>
<5, 9, 14>
<7, 8, 13>
<9, 12, 0>
<9, 12, 2>
<9, 12, 0>
