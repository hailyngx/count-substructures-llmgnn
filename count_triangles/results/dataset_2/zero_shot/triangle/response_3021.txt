Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 10) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 5) (8, 19) (8, 6) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 8) (6, 5) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 9) (15, 7) (15, 2) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 14) (13, 11) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 2) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 17) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 17) (10, 16) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 14)
