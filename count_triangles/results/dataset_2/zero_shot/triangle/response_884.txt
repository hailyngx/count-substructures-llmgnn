Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 11) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 16) (14, 13) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (3, 11) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 13) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 10) (15, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (6, 17) (6, 18) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 1) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 6) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 15) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9)
