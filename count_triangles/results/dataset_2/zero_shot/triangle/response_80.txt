Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2)
