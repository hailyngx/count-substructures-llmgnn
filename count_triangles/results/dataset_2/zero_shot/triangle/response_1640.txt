Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 5) (11, 8) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 16) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 15) (7, 0) (7, 16) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 9) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 17) (19, 18) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 9) (15, 0) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 18) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [18].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
