Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 19) (13, 5) (13, 19) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 1) (6, 5) (0, 11) (0, 3) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 17) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 12) (17, 7) (17, 4) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 12) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 12) (2, 9) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 2) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 18) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 18)
