Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) 

Response:
