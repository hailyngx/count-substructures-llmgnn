Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [18]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 9, 4>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 6, 8>.
