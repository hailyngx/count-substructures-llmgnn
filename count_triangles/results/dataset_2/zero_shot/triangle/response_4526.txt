Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 7)
