Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
