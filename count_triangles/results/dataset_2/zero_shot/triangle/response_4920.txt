Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 12) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 2) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 2) (3, 12) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 2)
