Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 16) (15, 10) (15, 14) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 19) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 17) (6, 3) (6, 8) (14, 15) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 17) (4, 3) (4, 16) (4, 19) (13, 3) (13, 7) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 19) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: <0, 3, 18>, <0, 9, 19>, <0, 10, 12>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 19>, <5, 17, 19>, <9, 16, 4>
