Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7)
