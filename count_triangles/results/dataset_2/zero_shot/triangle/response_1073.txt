Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (16, 12) (16, 10) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 9) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 12) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 10) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 3) (9, 4) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 19) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 7)
