Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 8, 9>.
