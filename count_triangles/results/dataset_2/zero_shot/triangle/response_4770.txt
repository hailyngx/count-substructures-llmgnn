Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 11) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 7) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 9, 13>
<0, 9, 14>
<3, 6, 12>
<3, 9, 12>
<4, 8, 10>
<4, 8, 11>
<1, 11, 13>
