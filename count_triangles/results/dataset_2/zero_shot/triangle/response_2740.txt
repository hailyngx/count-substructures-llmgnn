Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2)
