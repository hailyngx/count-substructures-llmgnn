Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 15) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 6) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 0) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 15) (17, 12) (17, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 6) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 18) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 16) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 6) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 19) (15, 8) (0, 12) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 16) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is 6. 
The unique triangles found are <5, 10, 4>, <5, 10, 2>, <5, 13, 19>, <5, 13, 7>, <3, 16, 2>, <15, 19, 8>.
