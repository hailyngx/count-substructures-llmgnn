Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, and <7, 8, 9>.
