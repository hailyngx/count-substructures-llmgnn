Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 9>, and <1, 4, 9>.
