Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].  
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 7>, <6, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, and <6, 0, 9>.
