Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 8) (10, 4) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 19) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 13) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 15) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 4) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 3) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 18) (16, 18) (15, 9) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 18) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 3)
