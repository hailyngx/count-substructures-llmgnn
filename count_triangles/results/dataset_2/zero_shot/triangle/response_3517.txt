Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 14) (3, 14) (3, 12) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 4) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 11) (12, 3) (12, 17) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 15) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (19, 5) (19, 13) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 14) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 16) (13, 15) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) (4, 15) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6)
