Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0)
