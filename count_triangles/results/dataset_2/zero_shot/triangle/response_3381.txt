Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 19) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 2) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 15) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (8, 0) (8, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 2) (18, 12) (18, 19) (17, 3) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 15) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 19) (10, 9) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 15) (15, 12) (15, 14) (15, 4)
