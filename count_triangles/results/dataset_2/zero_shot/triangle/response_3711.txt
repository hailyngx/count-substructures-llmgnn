Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 18) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 18) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 10) (8, 16) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 7) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 2) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (6, 15) (6, 1) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 12) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 0) (19, 3) (19, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 18) (16, 5) (16, 8)
