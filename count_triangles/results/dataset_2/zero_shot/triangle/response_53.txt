Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 4) (16, 15) (5, 19) (5, 18) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 19) (0, 2) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 12) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 2) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 6) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 13) 

Response:

<0, 4, 11>
<0, 4, 14>
<4, 14, 0>
<4, 14, 3>
<8, 9, 19>
<8, 19, 2>
<15, 6, 18>
