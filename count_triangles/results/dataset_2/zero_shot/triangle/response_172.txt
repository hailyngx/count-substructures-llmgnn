Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 12) 

Response:
[<0, 7, 14>, <2, 8, 14>, <3, 9, 14>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 10, 13>, <6, 10, 12>, <10, 11, 12>]
