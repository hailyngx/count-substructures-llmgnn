Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 17) (5, 13) (5, 16) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 9) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 14) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 16) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 6) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 12) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 11) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 17) (7, 11) (6, 14) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 6)
