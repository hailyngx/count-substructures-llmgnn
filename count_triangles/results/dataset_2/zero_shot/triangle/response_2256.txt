Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 9) (10, 18) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (19, 5) (19, 7) (15, 8) (15, 0) (15, 4) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (18, 10) (18, 1) (3, 16) (3, 6) (7, 13) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 7) (14, 5) (14, 9) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 1) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (1, 18) (1, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [27] triangles in the graph.
