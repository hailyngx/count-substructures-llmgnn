Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0)
