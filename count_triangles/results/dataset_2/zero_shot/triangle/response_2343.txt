Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are [16] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 1, 9>, <3, 1, 7>, <3, 1, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <7, 1, 3>, <8, 4, 5>.
