Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 2) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 2) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 19) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 6) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 14) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 16) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 6) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 18) (14, 9) (14, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 11) (13, 14) (19, 10) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 19) 

Response:
There are [47] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: <2, 3, 17>, <6, 8, 12>, <4, 9, 14>, <4, 9, 18>, <4, 6, 8>, <0, 5, 18>, <10, 12, 16>, <8, 11, 13>, <16, 19, 6>, <9, 16, 19>, <15, 2, 16>, <9, 14, 13>, <0, 5, 15>, <9, 18, 1>, <5, 15, 0>, <12, 10, 16>, <9, 14, 13>, <0, 11, 13>, <15, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 1>, <6, 3, 17>, <17, 2, 16>, <9, 4, 6>, <12, 6, 3>, <8, 7, 1>, <15, 4, 6>, <10, 17, 3>, <12, 6, 4>, <9, 18, 5>, <10, 17, 2>, <8, 0, 5>, <6, 12, 10>, <17, 10, 12>, <18, 9, 4>, <15, 5, 0>, <2, 15, 5>, <16, 12, 6>, <19, 16, 12>, <5, 18, 9>, <8, 6, 4>, <6, 19, 16>, <16, 2, 3>, <17, 3, 6>, <2, 16, 19>, <13, 14, 9>, <4, 6, 3>.
