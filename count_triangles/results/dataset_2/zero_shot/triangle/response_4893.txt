Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles are: <1, 7, 3>, <1, 7, 4>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 6>, <9, 1, 7>, <8, 6, 9>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 4, 5>.
