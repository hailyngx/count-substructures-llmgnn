Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 2) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 14) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
There are total of [12] triangles in the graph. 
The unique triangles found are <11, 12, 14>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 7, 14>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 10>, <4, 6, 11>, <5, 6, 14>, <10, 11, 14>, <10, 2, 0>, <2, 13, 0>.
