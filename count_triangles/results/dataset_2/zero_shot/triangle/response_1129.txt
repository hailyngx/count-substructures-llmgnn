Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 18) (17, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 9) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 15) (1, 0) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 11) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 3) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 3) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 15) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 4) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique triangles are <0, 7, 12>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 16, 15>, <2, 4, 19>, <2, 5, 15>, <3, 9, 16>, <6, 11>, <11, 13, 6>.
