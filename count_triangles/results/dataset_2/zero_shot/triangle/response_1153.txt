Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles are <5, 9, 1>, <5, 9, 0>, <5, 9, 6>, <5, 9, 2>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 0>, <8, 9, 4>, <8, 9, 7>.
