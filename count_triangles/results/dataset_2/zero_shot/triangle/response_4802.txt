Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 12) (11, 15) (17, 18) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (19, 4) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 16) (13, 3) (0, 1) (0, 16) (16, 19) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 10) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 14) (12, 11) (12, 5) (10, 16) (10, 8) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 18) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 8) (8, 16) (8, 10) (8, 18) (9, 7)
