Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 3) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 13) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 14>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 10>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 13>, <3, 11, 14>, <7, 9, 14>, <8, 6, 13>.
