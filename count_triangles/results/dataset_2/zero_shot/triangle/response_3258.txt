Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <1, 8, 11>, <1, 10, 13>, <1, 10, 2>, <5, 11, 6>, and <7, 13, 1>. [5]
