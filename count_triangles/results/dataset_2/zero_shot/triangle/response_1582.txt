Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [10]. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <3, 2, 0>, <3, 2, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 0>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 0, 6>.
