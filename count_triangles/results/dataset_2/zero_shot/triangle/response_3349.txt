Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 18) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 11) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 14) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 18) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 19) (5, 17) (5, 8) (5, 11) (6, 15) (6, 16) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 16) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (13, 16) (13, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 2) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 13) (15, 6) (15, 9) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 16) (16, 6) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 9) 

Response:
There are [56] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are <0, 3, 14>, <1, 10, 17>, <1, 10, 4>, <1, 12, 9>, <2, 1, 10>, <2, 1, 12>, <3, 0, 14>, <3, 2, 1>, <3, 2, 19>, <3, 4, 10>, <5, 8, 17>, <5, 8, 14>, <5, 11, 17>, <5, 11, 13>, <5, 17, 10>, <6, 9, 15>, <6, 9, 16>, <7, 11, 17>, <7, 11, 5>, <8, 5, 17>, <8, 5, 11>, <8, 5, 14>, <9, 12, 1>, <9, 12, 15>, <9, 13, 16>, <9, 15, 6>, <10, 1, 12>, <10, 1, 2>, <10, 4, 3>, <11, 7, 18>, <11, 7, 17>, <11, 13, 16>, <11, 13, 5>, <14, 0, 3>, <14, 0, 18>, <14, 3, 4>, <16, 6, 15>, <16, 6, 9>, <16, 9, 15>, <16, 13, 11>, <16, 13, 18>, <17, 8, 5>, <17, 8, 14>, <18, 7, 11>, <18, 7, 0>, <18, 13, 16>, <19, 2, 1>, <19, 2, 3>, <19, 4, 10>, <19, 8, 5>
