Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 18) (10, 15) (10, 16) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 19) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 13) (8, 18) (8, 6) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 15) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 5) (11, 2) (11, 1) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 13) (16, 10) (16, 3) (9, 0) (9, 13) (5, 4) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 13) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<4, 1, 5>
<3, 13, 14>
<3, 13, 6>
<3, 13, 9>
<3, 13, 16>
<8, 6, 13>
<0, 14, 12>
<0, 14, 1>
