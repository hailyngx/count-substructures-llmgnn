Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are [23] triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are: <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 8, 1>, <3, 8, 4>, <3, 9, 5>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>.
