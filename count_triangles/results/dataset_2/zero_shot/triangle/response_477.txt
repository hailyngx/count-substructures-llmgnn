Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 6) (14, 17) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 2) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 14) (13, 10) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 19) (5, 7) (5, 18) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 10) (19, 1) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 19) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 6) (16, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 4) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 9) (6, 15) (6, 0) (1, 8) (1, 19) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 17) (4, 16) (4, 11)
