Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 13) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 18) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 15) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 18) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 19) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 6) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 14) (15, 17) (15, 14) (6, 12) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 2) (13, 11) (13, 7) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 8) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 17) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 0, 7>
<4, 5, 3>
<14, 1, 19>
<17, 15, 14>
