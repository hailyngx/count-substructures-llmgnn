Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 10) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<5, 9, 11>
<5, 9, 14>
<5, 6, 11>
<5, 6, 14>
<9, 8, 11>
<9, 8, 14>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 8, 14>
<4, 8, 14>
<6, 7, 13>
<7, 12, 9>
<7, 12, 13>
<11, 13, 6>
<7, 10, 13>
<0, 2, 7> 

Therefore, there are total [15] triangles in the given graph.
