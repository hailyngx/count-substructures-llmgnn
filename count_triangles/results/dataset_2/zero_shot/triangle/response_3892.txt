Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 1) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 7)
