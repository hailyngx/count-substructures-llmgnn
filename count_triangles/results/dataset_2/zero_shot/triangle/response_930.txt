Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 1) (8, 6) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 6) (2, 17) (2, 11) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (0, 13) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 16) (1, 9) (1, 12) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 5) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 3) (4, 3) (12, 10) (12, 1) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 4) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 5) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 11) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 5)
