Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <1, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 4>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 4>, and <3, 8, 5>.
