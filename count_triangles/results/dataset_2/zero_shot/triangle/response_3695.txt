Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 10) (14, 9) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 14)
