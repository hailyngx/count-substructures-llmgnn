Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 25) (16, 18) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 27) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 18) (25, 16) (25, 20) (26, 28) (26, 21) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 7) (4, 12) (4, 17) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 0) (13, 5) (13, 7) (15, 19) (15, 23) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 23) (17, 11) (17, 28) (17, 4) (17, 22) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 21) (24, 6) (24, 12) (24, 8) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 20) (18, 0) (18, 8) (19, 15) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (7, 28) (7, 13) (7, 29) (29, 11) (29, 27) (29, 7) (29, 23) (29, 14) (3, 27) (3, 10) (14, 2) (14, 29) (0, 26) (0, 5) (0, 18) (8, 11) (8, 20) (8, 24) (8, 18) (23, 15) (23, 12) (23, 29) (21, 26) (21, 2) (10, 9) (10, 3) (22, 17) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [48].
The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 5, 0>, <1, 5, 13>, <2, 14, 29>, <2, 21, 26>, <4, 12, 24>, <4, 17, 28>, <6, 9, 18>, <6, 9, 24>, <8, 18, 0>, <8, 20, 25>, <9, 18, 0>, <9, 27, 29>, <11, 16, 25>, <11, 17, 28>, <11, 29, 7>, <12, 23, 29>, <13, 5, 7>, <15, 19, 23>, <17, 4, 12>, <17, 4, 22>, <18, 0, 5>, <18, 8, 24>, <20, 8, 24>, <21, 2, 14>, <23, 12, 29>, <26, 0, 5>, <26, 21, 2>, <27, 3, 10>.
