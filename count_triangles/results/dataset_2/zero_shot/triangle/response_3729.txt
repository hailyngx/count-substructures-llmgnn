Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [6].
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 8>.
