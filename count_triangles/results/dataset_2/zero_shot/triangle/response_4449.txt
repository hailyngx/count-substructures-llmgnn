Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 15) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 19) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 16) (13, 5) (13, 17) (9, 8) (9, 1) (17, 13) (19, 16) (19, 14) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 15) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (3, 0) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 6) (18, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (4, 11) (4, 10)
