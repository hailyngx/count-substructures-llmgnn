Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (10, 8) (10, 6) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 8, 10>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 12, 14>
<8, 11, 13>
<9, 12, 14>
<9, 13, 12>
<11, 12, 14>
