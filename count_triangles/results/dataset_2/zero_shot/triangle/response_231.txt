Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 11)
