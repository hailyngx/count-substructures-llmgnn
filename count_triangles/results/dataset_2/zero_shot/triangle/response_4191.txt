Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 4) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 5) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 10)
