Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found are: <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 3>, <3, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 2>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 9>.
