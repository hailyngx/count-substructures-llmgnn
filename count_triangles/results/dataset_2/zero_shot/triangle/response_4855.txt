Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 14) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
There are [24] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 10>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 9, 13>, <6, 4, 5>, <6, 4, 3>, <6, 0, 3>, <7, 1, 4>, <7, 1, 10>, <9, 2, 3>, <9, 2, 11>, <9, 3, 10>, <9, 3, 6>, <10, 1, 4>, <10, 13, 14>, <11, 4, 7>, <11, 13, 14>, <11, 13, 10>, <12, 0, 9>, <12, 0, 6>, <13, 10, 14>, <13, 11, 14>.
