Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [22].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
