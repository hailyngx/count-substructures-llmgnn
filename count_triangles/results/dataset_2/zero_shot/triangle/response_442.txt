Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (12, 11) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 0)
