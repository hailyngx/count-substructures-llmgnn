Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (16, 17) (16, 2) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 13) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 10) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (19, 5) (19, 1) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 17) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 13) (12, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (0, 6)
