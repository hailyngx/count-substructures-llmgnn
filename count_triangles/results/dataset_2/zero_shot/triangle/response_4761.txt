Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 29) (13, 1) (13, 15) (22, 27) (22, 28) (22, 7) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 19) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 6) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 8) (21, 15) (8, 21) (8, 5) (8, 16) (23, 7) (23, 12) (23, 20) (1, 13) (1, 10) (26, 2) (0, 14) (0, 29) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 16) (14, 10) (4, 14) (4, 24) (4, 28) (18, 27) (18, 24) (18, 17) (28, 22) (28, 4) (17, 18) (20, 23) (20, 5) (10, 9) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 27) (2, 26) (2, 12) (2, 16) (12, 23) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (5, 8) (5, 20) (5, 15) (29, 13) (29, 0) (29, 3) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 24) (16, 15) (24, 4) (24, 18) (24, 16) (11, 6) (11, 12) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 3) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 10) (27, 3) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 29) (3, 19) (3, 27) (15, 13) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 16) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <2, 14, 16>, <3, 9, 27>, <3, 12, 27>, <3, 19, 27>, <4, 14, 16>, <5, 8, 21>, <5, 15, 16>, <5, 15, 21>, <6, 11, 12>, <6, 11, 21>, <6, 12, 19>, <6, 19, 21>, <9, 10, 27>, and <10, 14, 16>.
