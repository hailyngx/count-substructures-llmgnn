Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2)
