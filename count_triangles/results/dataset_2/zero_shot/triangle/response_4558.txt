Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 6, 0>, <4, 1, 5>, <4, 1, 2>, <4, 2, 5>, <4, 2, 1>, <4, 2, 0>, <4, 2, 7>, <4, 2, 6>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 1>, <3, 5, 2>, <3, 9, 8>.
