Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 10) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 3) (13, 2)
