Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<3, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 12>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 10>
