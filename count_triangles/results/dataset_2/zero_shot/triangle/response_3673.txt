Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 18) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 18) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 4) (10, 7) (17, 12) (17, 15) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 12) (4, 13) (4, 18) (0, 9) (0, 6) (14, 9) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 1) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 17) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 18) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 2)
