Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <4, 11, 14>, <1, 5, 8>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 5, 10>, <3, 5, 12>, <8, 12, 14>.
