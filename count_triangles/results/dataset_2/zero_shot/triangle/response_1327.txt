Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [18].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 6, 0>, <2, 6, 4>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 0, 1>, <4, 2, 6>, <4, 2, 0>, <4, 2, 3>, <4, 2, 8>, <6, 1, 0>, <6, 2, 0>, <8, 1, 7>.
