Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 19) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 15) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 18) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (15, 11) (15, 13) (16, 0) (16, 1) (12, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 5) (19, 9) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 13) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 16)
