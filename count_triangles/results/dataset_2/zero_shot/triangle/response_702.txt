Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <1, 7, 9>
4. <1, 3, 8>
5. <2, 4, 9>
6. <2, 3, 5>
7. <2, 4, 9>
8. <6, 7, 8>
