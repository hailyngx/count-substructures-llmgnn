Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 10) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13)
