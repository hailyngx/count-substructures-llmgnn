Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <1, 8, 4>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 7>, <3, 7, 0>.
