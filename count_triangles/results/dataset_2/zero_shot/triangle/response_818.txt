Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 19) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 12) (12, 3) (12, 13) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 18) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 18) (17, 11) (17, 2) (19, 15) (19, 9) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 17) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 19) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <5, 8, 6>, <5, 8, 7>, <6, 10, 14>, <6, 10, 18>, <1, 18, 0>, <1, 18, 14>, <2, 1, 14>, <7, 2, 14>.
