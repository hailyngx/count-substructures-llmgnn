Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 27) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 24) (9, 3) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 23) (22, 18) (22, 12) (8, 9) (8, 23) (8, 24) (23, 18) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 29) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 10) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 25) (4, 20) (4, 29) (11, 28) (11, 14) (11, 1) (28, 2) (28, 11) (28, 14) (17, 5) (17, 20) (17, 21) (20, 4) (20, 17) (20, 27) (20, 14) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 26) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 13) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 24) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 20) (14, 12) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 19) (3, 9) (3, 0) (29, 23) (29, 4) (29, 25) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 16) (24, 15) (1, 23) (1, 11) (1, 19) (15, 24) (15, 25) (26, 0) (26, 25) (21, 17) (21, 27) (27, 6) (27, 20) (27, 21) (10, 5) (13, 7) (13, 19) (25, 2) (25, 29) (25, 15) (25, 26) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows: 
<2, 24, 25>, <3, 9, 18>, <3, 9, 0>, <3, 0, 26>, <3, 0, 7>, <4, 20, 14>, <4, 20, 29>, <4, 29, 25>, <12, 14, 19>, <12, 16, 24>, <15, 24, 25>, <19, 1, 23>, <19, 1, 11>, <19, 12, 22>, <19, 13, 7>, <20, 27, 21>, <23, 8, 24>, <23, 1, 11>.
