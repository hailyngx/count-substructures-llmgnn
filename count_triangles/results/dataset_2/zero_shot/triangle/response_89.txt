Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 12) (15, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 11) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 16) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 17) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 17) (17, 2) (17, 1) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 18) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 0) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 14) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 18) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 0)
