Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 8) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 13>
<0, 9, 12>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 11, 12>
<3, 7, 10>
<5, 8, 12>
