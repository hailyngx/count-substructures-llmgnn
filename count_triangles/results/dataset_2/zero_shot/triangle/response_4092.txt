Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 14) (12, 11) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 13) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 19) (0, 2) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (18, 9) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 10) (17, 7) (17, 3) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 16) (5, 14) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 16) (13, 15) (16, 5) (16, 14) (6, 4) (6, 15) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique triangles in the given graph. 

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 2, 10>, <0, 8, 7>, <5, 11, 14>, <9, 15, 18>
