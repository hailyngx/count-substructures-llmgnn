Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 5) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3)
