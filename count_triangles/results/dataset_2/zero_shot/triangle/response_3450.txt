Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 0) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 12) (8, 9) (8, 14) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 15) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 15) (3, 5) (3, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 13) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 1) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are [24] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are: <0, 11, 16>, <0, 1, 19>, <0, 6, 15>, <0, 10, 11>, <0, 10, 19>, <0, 10, 13>, <0, 11, 7>, <1, 12, 19>, <1, 14, 15>, <1, 17, 4>, <1, 17, 15>, <1, 18, 6>, <2, 5, 12>, <2, 5, 19>, <4, 1, 17>, <4, 6, 15>, <6, 10, 13>, <6, 13, 14>, <6, 15, 12>, <8, 9, 14>, <8, 9, 10>, <10, 13, 14>, <11, 7, 13>, <15, 14, 13>
