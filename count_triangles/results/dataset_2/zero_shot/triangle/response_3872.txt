Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
[<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>]
[<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>]
There are [15] triangles in the given graph.
