Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is as follows: [10]

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:

<0, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 3, 6>
<4, 7, 0>
<5, 8, 6>
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 9, 8>
