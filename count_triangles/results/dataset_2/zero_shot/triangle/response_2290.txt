Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8)
