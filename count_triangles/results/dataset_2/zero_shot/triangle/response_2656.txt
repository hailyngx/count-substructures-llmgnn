Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 27) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 19) (21, 20) (21, 18) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 24) (29, 26) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 25) (13, 27) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 20) (5, 27) (24, 26) (24, 17) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 15) (25, 29) (25, 7) (25, 4) (25, 10) (25, 11) (16, 17) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 19) (20, 21) (20, 29) (20, 5) (20, 7) (9, 29) (9, 15) (2, 22) (2, 4) (22, 0) (22, 14) (22, 2) (3, 17) (3, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (11, 0) (11, 25) (11, 6) (11, 8) (19, 14) (19, 16) (15, 7) (15, 9) (23, 1) (23, 16) (23, 27) (10, 25) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (18, 21) (18, 5) (8, 26) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 10) (4, 25) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 10) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 23)
