Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2)
