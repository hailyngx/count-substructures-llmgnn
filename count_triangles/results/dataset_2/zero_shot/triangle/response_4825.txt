Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 6) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 9) 

Response:
