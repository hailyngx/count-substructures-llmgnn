Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 15) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 16) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 1) (12, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 19) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 14) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 19) (2, 19) (2, 14) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 16) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 2) (10, 4) (18, 0) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <3, 8, 15>, <5, 11, 13>, <1, 16, 19>, <6, 14, 2>, <6, 15, 3>, <11, 14, 8>, <4, 11, 19>, <0, 1, 18>, <9, 8, 17>, <5, 9, 13>, <8, 14, 2>, <15, 16, 19>, <3, 11, 14>, <4, 10, 19>.
