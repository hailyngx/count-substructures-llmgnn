Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 10) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
The unique triangles found are: <4, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 9, 14>, <4, 10, 14>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 10, 14>, <5, 8, 13>, <5, 9, 13>, <6, 8, 14>, <6, 10, 14>, <7, 8, 11>, <7, 11, 12>, <9, 10, 14>, <10, 12, 14>, <11, 12, 13>.
