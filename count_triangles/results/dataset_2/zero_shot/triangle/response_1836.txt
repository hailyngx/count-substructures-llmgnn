Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 14) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6)
