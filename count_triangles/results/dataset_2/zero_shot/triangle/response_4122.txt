Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 10) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 12) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

Unique triangles found in the graph:
<1, 8, 0>
<1, 8, 3>
<1, 13, 2>
<1, 13, 8>
<0, 7, 14>
<0, 12, 11>
<2, 5, 11>
<5, 7, 14>
