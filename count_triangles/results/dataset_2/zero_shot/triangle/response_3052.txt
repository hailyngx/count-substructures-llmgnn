Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 5, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>.
