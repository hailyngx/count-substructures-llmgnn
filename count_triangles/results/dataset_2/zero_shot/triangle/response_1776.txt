Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 13) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 0) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 2) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 0) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 2) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 18) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 12) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 7) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [18]. 
The unique triangles found are <3, 13, 2>, <3, 12, 2>, <3, 15, 2>, <3, 13, 15>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 14, 10>, <4, 10, 14>, <4, 12, 2>, <4, 12, 3>, <4, 13, 2>, <4, 13, 3>, <4, 17, 18>, <5, 17, 9>, <5, 19, 15>, <5, 19, 0>, <5, 19, 15>, <9, 17, 5>, <12, 2, 3>.
