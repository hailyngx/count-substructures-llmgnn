Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5)
