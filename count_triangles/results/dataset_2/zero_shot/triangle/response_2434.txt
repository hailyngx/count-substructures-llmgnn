Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 11) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 14) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found are: <6, 0, 3>, <6, 3, 11>, <6, 9, 13>, <9, 1, 8>, <9, 13, 11>, <9, 14, 7>, <3, 7, 1>, <4, 11, 13>, <4, 2, 5>, <4, 14, 2>, <1, 5, 2>, <12, 11, 2>, <12, 2, 14>, <0, 5, 2>.
