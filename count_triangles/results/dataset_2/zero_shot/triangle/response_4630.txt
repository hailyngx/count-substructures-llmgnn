Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 1) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<4, 9, 11>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 13>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 3>
<0, 5, 14>
<2, 8, 10>
<2, 8, 11>
