Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
The unique triangles are <2, 5, 8>, <0, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 9>.
