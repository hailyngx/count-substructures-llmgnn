Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2)
