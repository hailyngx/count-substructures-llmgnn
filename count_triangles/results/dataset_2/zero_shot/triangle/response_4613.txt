Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 0) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<8, 14, 0>
<2, 5, 13>
<3, 9, 11>
<6, 8, 0>
<2, 6, 11>
<2, 8, 0>
<7, 13, 5>
<3, 6, 11>
