Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 11>, <0, 4, 14>, <0, 5, 1>, <2, 4, 11>, <2, 4, 14>, <2, 9, 14>, <3, 10, 8>, <3, 10, 12>, <3, 12, 8>, <3, 13, 0>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 1>, <5, 7, 11>, <5, 7, 14>, <7, 11, 4>, <10, 2, 9>.
