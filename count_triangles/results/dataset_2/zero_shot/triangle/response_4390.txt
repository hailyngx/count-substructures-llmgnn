Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 11) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 0) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 14)
