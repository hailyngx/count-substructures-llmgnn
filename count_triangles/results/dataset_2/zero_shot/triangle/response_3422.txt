Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [22]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 2>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 8>.
