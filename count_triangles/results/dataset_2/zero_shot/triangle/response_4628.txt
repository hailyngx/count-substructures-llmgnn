Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 9) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 6) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 9) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12)
