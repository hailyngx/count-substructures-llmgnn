Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 11) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 6)
