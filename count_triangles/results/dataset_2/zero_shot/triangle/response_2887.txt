Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 11) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (10, 6) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 1) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<5, 9, 4>
<5, 9, 14>
<5, 9, 12>
<5, 1, 11>
<5, 1, 4>
<9, 12, 14>
<9, 6, 3>
<6, 7, 11>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 11, 2>
<12, 13, 2>
<2, 0, 14>
<13, 12, 2>
