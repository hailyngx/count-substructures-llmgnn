Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
