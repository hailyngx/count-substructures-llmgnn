Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 19) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 17) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 8) (2, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 15) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 5) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 15) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (15, 9) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 5) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 11) (5, 15) (13, 6)
