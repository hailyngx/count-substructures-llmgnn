Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 21) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 12) (22, 3) (20, 25) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 29) (25, 4) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 17) (8, 14) (8, 29) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 16) (26, 16) (9, 22) (9, 10) (9, 12) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 28) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 27) (16, 1) (16, 26) (16, 6) (21, 18) (21, 29) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 6) (3, 22) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 28) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 29) (5, 24) (5, 15) (15, 19) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 12) (14, 20) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 28) (14, 4) (28, 17) (28, 2) (28, 14) (4, 25) (4, 19) (4, 14) (12, 22) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 13) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 12) (24, 5) (29, 25) (29, 8) (29, 21) (29, 5) (27, 10) (27, 7) (27, 6) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 3) (6, 27) 

Response:
There are 8 unique triangles in the given graph:
<3, 7, 27>
<3, 5, 15>
<1, 2, 16>
<1, 17, 28>
<9, 10, 22>
<9, 12, 15>
<14, 15, 28>
<19, 5, 15>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
