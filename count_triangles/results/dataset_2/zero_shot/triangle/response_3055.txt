Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (10, 8) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (8, 10) (8, 17) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (12, 2) (12, 18) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 19) (15, 19) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 15) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are [64] triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are <3, 9, 11>, <13, 4, 14>, <0, 9, 11>, <5, 1, 13>, <2, 11, 16>, <1, 5, 7>, <7, 5, 13>, <2, 18, 12>, <0, 16, 11>, <19, 7, 15>, <1, 11, 13>, <16, 11, 2>, <12, 2, 18>, <13, 5, 7>, <4, 14, 3>, <14, 3, 9>, <7, 19, 15>, <17, 18, 2>, <17, 8, 10>, <5, 6, 14>.
