Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 14) (2, 12) (2, 5) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: <3, 6, 11>, <1, 6, 14>, <1, 9, 10>, <3, 8, 14>, <3, 11, 14>, <4, 7, 12>, <5, 11, 14>, <7, 8, 12>, <7, 12, 4>, <8, 9, 10>, <8, 13, 6>, <10, 14, 3>
