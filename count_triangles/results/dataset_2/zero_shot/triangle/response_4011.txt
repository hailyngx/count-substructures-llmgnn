Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 20) (3, 11) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 26) (25, 21) (20, 16) (20, 17) (20, 8) (8, 20) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 4) (13, 29) (7, 3) (7, 21) (7, 17) (21, 25) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 14) (18, 3) (18, 22) (18, 1) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 2) (6, 28) (6, 2) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 9) (9, 22) (9, 28) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 2) (24, 29) (26, 25) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 15) (17, 20) (17, 8) (17, 7) (17, 27) (0, 3) (4, 13) (4, 15) (4, 2) (12, 14) (5, 15) (5, 10) (5, 27) (10, 8) (10, 5) (14, 11) (14, 21) (14, 12) (2, 22) (2, 6) (2, 24) (2, 4) (2, 27) (1, 18) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 24) (15, 26) (15, 4) (15, 5) (19, 27) (19, 23) (27, 24) (27, 17) (27, 5) (27, 2) (27, 19) (23, 19) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [24]. 
The unique triangles found are <2, 4, 27>, <2, 24, 27>, <2, 4, 15>, <2, 4, 13>, <2, 4, 22>, <2, 24, 29>, <2, 22, 9>, <2, 22, 18>, <5, 15, 4>, <5, 15, 26>, <5, 10, 8>, <5, 10, 27>, <5, 10, 27>, <7, 17, 27>, <7, 21, 14>, <7, 21, 25>, <8, 13, 29>, <8, 13, 21>, <8, 13, 4>, <16, 11, 14>, <16, 11, 3>, <16, 11, 14>, <20, 8, 17>, <20, 8, 17>
