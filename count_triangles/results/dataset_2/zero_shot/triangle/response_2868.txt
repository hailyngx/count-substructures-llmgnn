Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 2) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 7) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (11, 0) (11, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 7) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
There are 19 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are: 

<0, 4, 14>
<0, 10, 12>
<0, 10, 3>
<0, 13, 4>
<0, 13, 8>
<0, 14, 4>
<1, 5, 10>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 9, 12>
<2, 9, 7>
<2, 9, 3>
<3, 10, 12>
<4, 12, 3>
<7, 9, 2>
<7, 9, 3>
<8, 13, 4>
<8, 13, 0>
<9, 7, 2>
<10, 12, 3>
 
So, there are a total of 19 triangles in the given graph.
