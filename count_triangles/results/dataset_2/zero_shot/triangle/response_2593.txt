Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 16) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 1) (6, 14) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 12) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 7) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (8, 14) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 16) (16, 15) (16, 0) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 10) (11, 19) (11, 4) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) 

Response:
There are <3, 12, 14>, <2, 12, 14>, and <0, 1, 10> triangles in this graph.

Total number of triangles: [3]
