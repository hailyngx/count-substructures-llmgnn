Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 10) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are [10] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<4, 8, 10>
<4, 8, 14>
<4, 10, 11>
<4, 10, 6>
<4, 10, 12>
<4, 11, 6>
<4, 11, 12>
<6, 10, 11>
<8, 10, 14>
<8, 14, 12>
