Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 9, 4>, <1, 9, 3>, <3, 9, 0>, <0, 8, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 3, 6>, <5, 3, 0>, <5, 4, 6>, <7, 8, 5>, <7, 5, 3>, <9, 4, 5>, <9, 4, 2>, <9, 3, 0>, <9, 1, 4>.
