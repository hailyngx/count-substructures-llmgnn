Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (3, 9) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 17) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 17) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 17) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 13) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 16) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 17) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (11, 5) (11, 9) (14, 15) (16, 12) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 13) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 7) (17, 18)
