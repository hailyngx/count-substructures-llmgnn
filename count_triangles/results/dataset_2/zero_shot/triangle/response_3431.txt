Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 13) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 11>, <0, 7, 13>, <0, 9, 10>, <0, 9, 13>, <0, 10, 13>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 13>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 0, 8>, <2, 12, 14>, <3, 0, 13>, <3, 8, 14>, <4, 5, 9>, <8, 11, 4>.
