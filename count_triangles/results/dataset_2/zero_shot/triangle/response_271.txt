Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 4, 9>, <6, 7, 8>.
