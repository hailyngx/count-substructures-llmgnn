Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 7) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0)
