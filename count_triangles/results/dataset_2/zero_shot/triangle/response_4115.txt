Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 14)
