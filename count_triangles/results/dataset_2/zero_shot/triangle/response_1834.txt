Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 6) (7, 12) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 16) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 9) (14, 16) (4, 19) (4, 13) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 17) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 14) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 13) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 15) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 17) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 15) (1, 10) (17, 18) (17, 9) (17, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 17)
