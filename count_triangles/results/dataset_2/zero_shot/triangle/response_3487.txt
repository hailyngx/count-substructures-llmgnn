Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 10) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 0) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12]. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 8, 12>

<0, 11, 12>
<3, 9, 14>
<4, 6, 11>
<4, 6, 13>
<4, 7, 10>
<4, 7, 13>
<5, 7, 10>
<7, 10, 13>
<8, 9, 12>
<8, 9, 10>
