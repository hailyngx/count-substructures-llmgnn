Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 13) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 16) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 2) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 14) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 3) (7, 18) (7, 14) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 15) (3, 12) (11, 19) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 15) (14, 19) (14, 7) (1, 18) (1, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 15)
