Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 18) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 18) (7, 6) (7, 19) (12, 16) (12, 17) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 8) (18, 13) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 19) (17, 12) (17, 15) (13, 3) (13, 18) (0, 10) (0, 8) (15, 16) (15, 17) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 8) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2)
