Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: 
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
