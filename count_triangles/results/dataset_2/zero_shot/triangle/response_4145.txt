Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 11) (7, 9) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 1) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 6) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 19) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (18, 14) (18, 15) (19, 16) (19, 1) (12, 6) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 11) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 8) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 15) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 15) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 16>, <1, 6, 19>, <1, 14, 15>, <1, 14, 18>, <2, 5, 16>, <2, 11, 15>, <3, 8, 10>, <3, 13, 15>, <4, 9, 11>, <6, 8, 10>, <6, 12, 8>, <13, 14, 15>.
