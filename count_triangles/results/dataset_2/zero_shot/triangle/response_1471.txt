Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 11) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 11) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 12) (8, 4) (8, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 11) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 15) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 12) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 9) (19, 2) (19, 13) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 19) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 9)
