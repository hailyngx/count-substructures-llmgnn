Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (6, 7) (6, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
Unique triangles found in the graph are:
<8, 13, 5>
<8, 9, 10>
<8, 5, 13>
<7, 9, 10>
<7, 9, 2>
<7, 11, 12>
