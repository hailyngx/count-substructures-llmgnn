Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 10) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 4) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 17) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 6) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 0) (18, 11) (18, 5) (12, 2) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 6) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 4) (7, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14)
