Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 8>.
