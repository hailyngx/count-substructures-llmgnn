Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [13]. 
The unique triangles found are <5, 2, 12>, <5, 4, 14>, <5, 9, 1>, <5, 9, 3>, <4, 7, 3>, <4, 7, 6>, <7, 2, 5>, <7, 2, 8>, <10, 11, 4>, <10, 11, 13>, <11, 1, 13>, <1, 6, 7>, <3, 12, 2>.
