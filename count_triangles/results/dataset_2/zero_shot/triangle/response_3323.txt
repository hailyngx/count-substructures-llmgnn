Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 13) (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (10, 18) (10, 1) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 17) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 18) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 18) (17, 2) (17, 1) (17, 3) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 0) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 2) (3, 5) (3, 17) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 13) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 14) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 4)
