Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 11) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 12)
