Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 14)
