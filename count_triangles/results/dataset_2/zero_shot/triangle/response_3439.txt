Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 9) (15, 16) (15, 3) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 10) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 18) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (2, 11) (2, 17) (2, 10) (9, 3) (9, 4) (18, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2)
