Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 17) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 13) (4, 9) (18, 19) (18, 13) (18, 8) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (8, 12) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 1) (16, 7) (16, 0) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 9) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 2) (2, 19) (2, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 17) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 18) (13, 11)
