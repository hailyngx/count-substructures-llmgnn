Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 14) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 4) (27, 29) (27, 24) (21, 9) (21, 5) (21, 22) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 10) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 7) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 3) (20, 19) (20, 6) (29, 27) (29, 12) (3, 11) (3, 18) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 7) (19, 20) (19, 6) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 5) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 7) (6, 20) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 29) (12, 2) (5, 11) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 2) (9, 21) (9, 28) (9, 25) (25, 9) (25, 0) (25, 4) (25, 10) (14, 16) (14, 15) (7, 15) (7, 26) (7, 8) (7, 22) (7, 1) (10, 28) (10, 25) (0, 25) (0, 4) (0, 23) (17, 24) (17, 18) (17, 8) (17, 23) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 25) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 4) (23, 0) (23, 17)
