Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 2) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 0)
