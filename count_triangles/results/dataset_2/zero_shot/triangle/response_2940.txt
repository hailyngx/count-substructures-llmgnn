Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 2, 6>
