Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>. [12]
