Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 7) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 2) (7, 17) (7, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 5) (9, 11) (10, 5) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 18) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 5) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 6)
