Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 18) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 16) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 3) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 3) (2, 6) (2, 15) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 18) (3, 9) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 10) (8, 5) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 9) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 1) (4, 17) (4, 11) (4, 1) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 1) (15, 5) (15, 2) 

Response:
There are [22] triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles found are: <0, 6, 14>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 9, 16>, <3, 9, 17>, <3, 9, 19>, <7, 11, 12>, <7, 11, 18>, <8, 10, 16>, <3, 17, 19>, <4, 11, 17>, <5, 15, 16>, <6, 14, 17>, <6, 14, 17>, <6, 14, 17>, <6, 17, 14>, <6, 17, 14>, <7, 11, 18>, <7, 11, 18>, <8, 5, 16>, <10, 8, 16>.
