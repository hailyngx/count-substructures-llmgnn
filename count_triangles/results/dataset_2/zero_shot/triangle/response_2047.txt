Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph:

The unique triangles are: 
<8, 2, 4>
<8, 4, 1>
<7, 9, 2>
<7, 2, 1>
<6, 0, 8>
<5, 3, 1>
