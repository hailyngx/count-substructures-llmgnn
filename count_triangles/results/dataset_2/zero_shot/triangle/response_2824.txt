Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (11, 14) (11, 18) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 14) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 7) (7, 17) (7, 5) (7, 10) (19, 13) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 4) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 16) (1, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
The unique triangles found are <2, 5, 17>, <4, 6, 17>, <4, 13, 5>, <4, 13, 10>, <5, 7, 10>, <8, 9, 15>, <8, 12, 14>, <9, 2, 15>, <9, 8, 12>, <9, 15, 5>, <13, 4, 18>, <13, 5, 17>, <13, 8, 12>, <13, 8, 9>, <13, 10, 7>, <16, 0, 2>.
