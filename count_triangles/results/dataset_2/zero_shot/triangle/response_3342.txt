Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 8) 

Response:

The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 10>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 12>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
