Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
The unique triangles found are <0, 9, 14>, <0, 13, 14>, <0, 3, 14>, <0, 1, 4>, <8, 12, 7>, <8, 12, 3>, <13, 11, 4>, <2, 1, 6>, <2, 9, 6>, <5, 10, 4>.
