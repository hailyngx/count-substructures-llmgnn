Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 13) (15, 16) (15, 3) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 11) (2, 10) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 3) (13, 7) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 1) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 17) (1, 18) (1, 9) (1, 7) (6, 16) (6, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 19) (14, 6) (14, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (9, 1) (9, 4) (12, 18) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 12) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1)
