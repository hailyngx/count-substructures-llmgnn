Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 14) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
There are [13] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 13>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 14>, <4, 12, 14>, <4, 13, 14>, <4, 12, 13>, <5, 8, 4>, <5, 8, 2>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 9, 10>, <6, 10, 13>, <10, 11, 13>.
