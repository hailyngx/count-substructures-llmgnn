Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 0) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 3) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 10) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 7) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 0) (15, 2) (15, 1) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 1) (16, 8) (16, 1) (7, 2) (7, 17) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 11) (13, 19) (13, 3)
