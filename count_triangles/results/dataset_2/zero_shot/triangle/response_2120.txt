Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 14)
