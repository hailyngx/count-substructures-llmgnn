Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 2) (6, 14) (12, 5) (12, 1)
