Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 1)
