Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2)
