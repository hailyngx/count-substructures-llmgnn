Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 12)
