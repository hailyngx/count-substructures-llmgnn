Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 6)
