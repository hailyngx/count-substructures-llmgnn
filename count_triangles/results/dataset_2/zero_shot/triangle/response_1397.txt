Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (4, 6) (4, 16) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 16) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (13, 11) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 19) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 15) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 11) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 11>, <1, 12, 7>, <1, 12, 10>, <1, 12, 7>, <1, 19, 8>, <1, 19, 10>, <1, 19, 15>, <2, 8, 19>, <2, 14, 4>, <2, 14, 3>, <2, 17, 15>, <4, 6, 7>, <8, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 19>.
