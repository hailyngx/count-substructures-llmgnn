Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. 

Total number of triangles: [10]
Unique triangles: <1, 6, 4>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 0, 7>, <3, 0, 4>, <3, 0, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <8, 1, 4>, <9, 6, 4>, <9, 6, 1>
