Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 4) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 8) (4, 14) (4, 3) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 18 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 6, 12>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 8, 14>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 12>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 8, 12>, <2, 8, 7>, <4, 3, 14>, <7, 8, 12>, <7, 8, 13>, <10, 11, 14>, <10, 11, 7>, <10, 13, 14>, <11, 7, 12>, <12, 7, 8>.
