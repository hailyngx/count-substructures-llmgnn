Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [24].
The unique triangles found are <8, 5, 6>, <8, 2, 9>, <8, 0, 4>, <8, 2, 1>, <8, 4, 3>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 3, 9>, <5, 7, 6>, <3, 9, 2>, <3, 4, 8>, <6, 7, 5>, <7, 1, 2>, and <0, 1, 2>.
