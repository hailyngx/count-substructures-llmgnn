Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 4) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<1, 9, 13>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 7, 14>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 10>
<3, 6, 12>
<3, 4, 12>
<4, 12, 13>
<4, 13, 14>
