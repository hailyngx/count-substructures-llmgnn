Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) 

Response:
[20]
