Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 3) (9, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 0) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 10) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 0) (8, 5) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 4) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 18) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 3) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 3) (12, 14) (12, 3) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <3, 4, 12>, <5, 13, 17>, <0, 6, 19>, <6, 10, 19>, <4, 14, 16>, <1, 14, 15>
