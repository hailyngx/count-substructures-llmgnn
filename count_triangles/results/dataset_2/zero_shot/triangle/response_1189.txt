Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14)
