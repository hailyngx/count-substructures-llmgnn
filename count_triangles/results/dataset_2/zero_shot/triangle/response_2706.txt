Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 1) (2, 0) (2, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1)
