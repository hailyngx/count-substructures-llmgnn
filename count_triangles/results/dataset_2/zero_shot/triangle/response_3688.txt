Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 10) (2, 0) (2, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 17) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 7) (19, 4) (19, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (6, 18) (16, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 4) (7, 13) (7, 18) 

Response:
There are [14] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 10>, <4, 11, 12>, <4, 9, 19>, <3, 9, 19>, <0, 3, 9>, <8, 12, 15>, <5, 12, 14>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 17>, <5, 12, 13>, <11, 14, 18>, <11, 14, 12>, <11, 12, 18>, <13, 15, 17>.
