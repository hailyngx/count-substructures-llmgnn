Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 19) (15, 0) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (11, 13) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 16) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 12) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 16) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 6) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 9) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 18) (1, 16) (1, 7) (1, 14) (6, 16) (6, 7) (4, 10) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 12)
