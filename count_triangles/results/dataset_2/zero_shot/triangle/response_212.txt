Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 12) (16, 7) (16, 15) (3, 1) (15, 16) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 7) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 17) (18, 13) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 1) (14, 2) (14, 4) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 11) (12, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 13) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [18].
