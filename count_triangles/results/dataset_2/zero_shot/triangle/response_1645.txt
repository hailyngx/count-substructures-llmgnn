Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 10) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 12)
