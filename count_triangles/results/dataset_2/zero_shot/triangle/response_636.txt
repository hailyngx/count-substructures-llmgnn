Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 17) (15, 16) (13, 14) (13, 17) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 4) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 6) (6, 14) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (18, 8)
