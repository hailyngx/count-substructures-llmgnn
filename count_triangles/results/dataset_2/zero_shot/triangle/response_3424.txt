Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 14) (6, 7) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 11) (17, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (0, 15) (0, 7) (14, 15) (14, 1) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 18) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (19, 4) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 19) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 8) (16, 3) (18, 10) (18, 13)
