Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (1, 17) (1, 13) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 5) (5, 17) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 18) (18, 13) (18, 9) (19, 0) (19, 7) (6, 17) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 12) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 15) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 3) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 17) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 7) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 9)
