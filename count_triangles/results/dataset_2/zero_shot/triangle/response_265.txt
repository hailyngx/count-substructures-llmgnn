Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (8, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 3>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>.
