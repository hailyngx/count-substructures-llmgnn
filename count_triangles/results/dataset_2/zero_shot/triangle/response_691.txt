Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 19) (6, 7) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 2) (13, 5) (13, 15) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 12) (10, 18) (10, 1) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 2) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 15) (2, 12) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 16) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 12) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 17) 

Response:
There are [26] triangles in this graph.
The unique triangles are: <0, 9, 19>, <2, 11, 15>, <2, 11, 18>, <2, 12, 19>, <3, 7, 12>, <4, 5, 19>, <4, 16, 17>, <8, 11, 18>, <8, 11, 2>, <8, 17, 16>, <9, 0, 19>, <9, 11, 18>, <9, 11, 2>, <10, 1, 16>, <10, 18, 15>, <12, 1, 19>, <12, 2, 19>, <13, 5, 15>, <14, 0, 1>, <14, 1, 10>, <16, 0, 17>, <16, 1, 14>, <16, 1, 10>, <17, 8, 16>, <18, 10, 15>
