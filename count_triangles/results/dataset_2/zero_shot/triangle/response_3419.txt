Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph. 

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 10>
<0, 5, 13>
<2, 4, 14>
<5, 7, 11>
