Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 5) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 5) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 12)
