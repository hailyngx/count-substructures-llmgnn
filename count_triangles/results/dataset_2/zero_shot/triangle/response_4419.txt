Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (19, 12) (19, 9) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 12) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (18, 10) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 6) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 14) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 9) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 9) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 11) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 14) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:
<2, 10, 17>
<5, 8, 11>
<6, 12, 15>
<7, 14, 16>
<9, 11, 16>
<12, 4, 19>  

So the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
