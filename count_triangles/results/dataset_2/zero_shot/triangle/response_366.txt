Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
[<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 7>]
