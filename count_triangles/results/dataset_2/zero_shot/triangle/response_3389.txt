Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 11) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12)
