Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 5) (4, 12) (4, 19) (7, 0) (7, 5) (14, 16) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 2) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 2) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 18) (1, 17) (1, 6) (0, 7) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 12) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14)
