Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 10) (12, 7) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 13) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 18) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 11) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 11) (3, 5) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 13) (14, 7) (14, 18) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 17) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 3) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 19) (1, 10) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 11) (18, 14) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 1) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 11)
