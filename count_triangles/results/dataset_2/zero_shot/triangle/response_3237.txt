Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 2)
