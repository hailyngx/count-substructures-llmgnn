Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [18] triangles in the given graph:
<5, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 2, 1>, <5, 2, 8>, <5, 1, 8>, <9, 6, 8>, <6, 2, 1>, <6, 2, 4>, <6, 8, 0>, <2, 8, 1>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 4>, <8, 6, 0>, <8, 2, 7>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 8, 4>, <7, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 6>
