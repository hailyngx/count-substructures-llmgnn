Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 22) (16, 27) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 2) (27, 16) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 1) (27, 13) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 2) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 26) (25, 28) (25, 10) (15, 20) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 12) (17, 18) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 19) (29, 13) (24, 26) (24, 7) (26, 25) (26, 24) (9, 25) (9, 21) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 22) (8, 7) (19, 29) (19, 8) (4, 12) (4, 23) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 18) (21, 16) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 14) (5, 8) (5, 2) (14, 21) (2, 0) (2, 20) (2, 5) (2, 22) (22, 16) (22, 8) (22, 2) (22, 10) (7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 27) (1, 18) (28, 0) (28, 25) (28, 17) (23, 4) (6, 10) (10, 25) (10, 22) (10, 6) (18, 27) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 1) (13, 27) (13, 29)
