Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found are: <2, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 3>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 2>, <4, 6, 5>, <2, 6, 5>, <2, 6, 4>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 7>.
