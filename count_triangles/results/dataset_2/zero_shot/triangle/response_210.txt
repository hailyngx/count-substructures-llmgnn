Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 1) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of [14] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are: <0, 9, 12>, <1, 4, 5>, <4, 10, 11>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 13>, <4, 11, 12>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 11, 13>, <6, 10, 14>, <7, 9, 12>, <8, 13, 5>, <10, 7, 12>, <10, 11, 4>, <12, 9, 0>
