Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 11) (7, 16) (7, 6) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 15) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 9) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (16, 3) (16, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 18) (18, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (12, 11) (12, 15) (15, 5) (15, 12) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4)
