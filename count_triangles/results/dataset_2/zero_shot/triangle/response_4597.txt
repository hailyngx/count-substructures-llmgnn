Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 unique triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are:
1. <1, 5, 7>
2. <1, 7, 9>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <1, 4, 7>
5. <0, 1, 9>
6. <0, 3, 9>
7. <3, 5, 7>
8. <3, 7, 9>
9. <1, 8, 9>
10. <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
