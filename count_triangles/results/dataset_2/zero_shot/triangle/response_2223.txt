Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 9) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 3)
