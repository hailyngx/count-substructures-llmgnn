Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
Unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 5>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 9, 7>, <5, 6, 3>, <7, 8, 2>, <7, 8, 5>.
