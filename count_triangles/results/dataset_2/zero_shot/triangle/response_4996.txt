Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [9].
The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 7, 10>, <4, 8, 10>, <1, 9, 11>, <1, 8, 5>, <2, 8, 12>, <5, 8, 13>, <5, 12, 13>, <6, 8, 13>, <9, 12, 14>.
