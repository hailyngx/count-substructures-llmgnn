Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 19) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 18) (10, 19) (17, 8) (17, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 11) (18, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 2) (12, 4) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 15) (7, 3) (7, 6) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 19) 

Response:
There are a total of [44] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 8, 17>
<2, 5, 15>
<11, 13, 18>
<5, 9, 14>
<0, 6, 19>
