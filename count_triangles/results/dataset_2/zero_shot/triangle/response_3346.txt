Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
[<0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 9, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 9, 2>, <2, 9, 7>, <3, 1, 4>, <3, 8, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 9, 8>, <7, 9, 8>]
