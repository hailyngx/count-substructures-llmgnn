Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 26) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 23) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 23) (17, 7) (22, 14) (22, 23) (22, 16) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 22) (23, 3) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 27) (15, 19) (15, 4) (20, 4) (29, 12) (29, 11) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 12) (26, 6) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 18) (3, 23) (3, 11) (3, 28) (11, 29) (11, 3) (11, 25) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 1) (18, 8) (18, 26) (4, 15) (4, 20) (4, 27) (27, 13) (27, 4) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 25) (7, 5) (25, 11) (25, 7) (25, 24) (21, 6) (21, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 10) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 16) (10, 16) (10, 19) (19, 15) (19, 10) (1, 13) (1, 28) (1, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 21) (12, 14) (12, 29) (12, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [34] triangles in the given graph.

Here are some of the unique triangles found:
<2, 9, 11>, <4, 20, 27>, <7, 17, 25>, <16, 22, 23>, <14, 17, 23>, <4, 15, 19>, <0, 12, 29>, <0, 12, 14>, <1, 5, 28>, <11, 25, 7>, <0, 14, 16>, <13, 26, 28>, <8, 13, 26>, <16, 24, 25>, <16, 24, 17>, <6, 9, 21>, <7, 9, 17>, <4, 15, 19>, <5, 7, 25>, <12, 14, 29>, <13, 27, 4>, <7, 25, 24>, <16, 24, 17>, <1, 5, 28>.
