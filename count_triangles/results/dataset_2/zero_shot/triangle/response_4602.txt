Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 14) (15, 19) (15, 2) (7, 18) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 8) (16, 17) (16, 7) (16, 12) (12, 16) (9, 14) (9, 19) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 3) (13, 0) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 2) (11, 4) (11, 6) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [26].
The unique triangles found are <1, 7, 18>, <1, 7, 16>, <1, 10, 14>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 17>, <2, 0, 17>, <2, 6, 15>, <2, 0, 13>, <3, 4, 18>, <3, 14, 10>, <4, 5, 18>, <4, 11, 6>, <5, 8, 7>, <5, 1, 7>, <6, 8, 5>, <6, 11, 4>, <7, 16, 17>, <7, 1, 5>, <8, 5, 4>, <9, 14, 10>, <9, 19, 10>, <11, 4, 5>, <14, 9, 19>, <16, 12, 7>, <17, 0, 2>, <19, 9, 14>.
