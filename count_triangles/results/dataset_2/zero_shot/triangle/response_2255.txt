Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 8, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <7, 4, 6>.
