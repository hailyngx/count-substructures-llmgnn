Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) 

Response:
There are [12] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 3>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <7, 9, 5>, <1, 7, 9>.
