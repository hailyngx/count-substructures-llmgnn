Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 12) (6, 17) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (8, 15) (8, 10) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 16) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (13, 14) (1, 18) (1, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 19) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 2) (7, 18) (16, 5) (16, 18) (19, 2) 

Response:
[<0, 3, 11>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 11, 14>, <2, 3, 12>, <4, 8, 10>]
[<0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 18>, <0, 11, 12>, <2, 3, 5>, <4, 8, 15>]
[<0, 11, 14>, <3, 12, 15>, <5, 16, 18>, <6, 9, 10>, <14, 17, 6>]
[<0, 11, 14>, <0, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <4, 8, 15>, <6, 10, 11>]
[<0, 3, 15>, <0, 11, 14>, <4, 8, 15>, <6, 17, 12>, <8, 10, 11>]
