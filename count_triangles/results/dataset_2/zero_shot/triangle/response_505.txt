Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (8, 17) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 1) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 4) (4, 13) (4, 10) (0, 16) (0, 19) (0, 2) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 14) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 9) (18, 17) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 17) (6, 11) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 6) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (11, 12) (11, 6) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 2) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 19) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 14)
