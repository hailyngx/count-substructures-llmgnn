Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 1>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
