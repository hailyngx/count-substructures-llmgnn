Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 10) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles inside the given graph is [10].
The unique triangles found are <4, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 12, 14>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 10, 14>, <3, 9, 12>, <5, 10, 14>, <3, 6, 13>, <12, 13, 3>, <6, 9, 11>.
