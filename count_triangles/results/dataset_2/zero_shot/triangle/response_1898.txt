Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 9) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 3) (2, 5) (2, 12) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1)
