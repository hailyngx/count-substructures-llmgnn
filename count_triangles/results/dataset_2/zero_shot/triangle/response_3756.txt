Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 8) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 12, 14> 
<1, 5, 8> 
<1, 5, 9> 
<1, 8, 14> 
<2, 6, 9> 
<2, 6, 11> 
<9, 13, 14> 
<12, 10, 14>
