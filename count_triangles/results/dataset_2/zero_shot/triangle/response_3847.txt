Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.

Unique triangles are: <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 0>, <1, 0, 6>, <3, 1, 2>, <3, 1, 8>, <4, 0, 6>, <8, 4, 0>.
