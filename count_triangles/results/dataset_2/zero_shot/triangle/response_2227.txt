Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are <4, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <4, 1, 5>.
