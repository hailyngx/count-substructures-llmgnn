Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 14) (2, 13) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4)
