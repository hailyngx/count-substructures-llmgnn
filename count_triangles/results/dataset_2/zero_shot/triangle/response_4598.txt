Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 3) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 19) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 15) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 17) (3, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 12) (16, 7) (16, 8) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 12) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 18) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 18)
