Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 16) (2, 8) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 18) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (13, 14) (13, 3) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 19) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 19) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 15) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 5>
<7, 15, 17>
<11, 18, 19>
<7, 15, 18>
<2, 8, 15>
<6, 7, 16>
