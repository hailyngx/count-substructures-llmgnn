Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) 

Response:
