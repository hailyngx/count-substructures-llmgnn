Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 10) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 10) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13)
