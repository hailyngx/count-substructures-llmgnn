Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2)
