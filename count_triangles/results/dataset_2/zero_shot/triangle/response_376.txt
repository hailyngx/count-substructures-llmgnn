Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 13>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 7, 12>, <2, 3, 10>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 13>, <5, 7, 12>, <9, 10, 14>.
