Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 7) (1, 19) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 8) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (17, 18) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 5) (16, 6) (16, 0) (18, 17) (18, 14) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 11) (4, 9) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 15) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 11) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 15) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the graph.  
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 5>, <6, 15, 0>, <6, 15, 7>, <6, 11, 15>, <8, 12, 13>, <8, 12, 14>, <9, 10, 12>, <12, 13, 14>.
