Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 15) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 17) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 7) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 3) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 10) (19, 14) (19, 10) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 15) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 6) (12, 18) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 15) (13, 9) (13, 7) (18, 1) (18, 12)
