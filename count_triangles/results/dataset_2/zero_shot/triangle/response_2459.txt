Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8)
