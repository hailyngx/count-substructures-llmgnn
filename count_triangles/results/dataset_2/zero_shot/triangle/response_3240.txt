Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 12) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 12) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 0) (14, 12) (14, 1) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <10, 3, 9>, <10, 4, 7>, <10, 3, 11>, <10, 0, 1>, <2, 1, 6>, <11, 12, 14>, <11, 2, 7>, <5, 9, 11>
