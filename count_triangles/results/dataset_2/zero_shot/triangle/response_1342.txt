Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 15) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 17) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 16) (13, 7) (13, 4) (1, 14) (1, 19) (15, 12) (15, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 3) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 3) (19, 6) (0, 12) (0, 15) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 11) (6, 19) (6, 11) (6, 17) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 5) (16, 17) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 19) (3, 10) (4, 5) (4, 13) 

Response:
