Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 3) (1, 11) (15, 7) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 7) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (18, 9) (18, 3) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 12) (11, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (16, 19) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 19) (6, 16) (6, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 10) (3, 8) (3, 18) (3, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 12) (2, 17) (2, 16) (12, 17) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: <4, 8, 10>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 5, 6>, <9, 4, 13>, <9, 4, 12>, <9, 12, 14>, <12, 3, 18>, <13, 0, 6>, <13, 0, 19>, <13, 6, 19>, <16, 2, 17>, <16, 6, 19>, and <16, 17, 19>.
