Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 11) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 18) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 11) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 7) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 0) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 19) (7, 5) (7, 18) (7, 1) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 0) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 18) (14, 18) (14, 16) (12, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) (16, 9) (16, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
