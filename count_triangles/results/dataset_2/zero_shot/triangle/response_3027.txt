Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 7>.
