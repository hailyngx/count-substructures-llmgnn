Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 18) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 16) (17, 9) (17, 5) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 12) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 2) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 16) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (1, 10) (1, 16) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 9) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (19, 11) (19, 7) (13, 11) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 7, 12>, <0, 11, 14>, <6, 11, 13>, <6, 14, 16>, <7, 12, 18>, <8, 10, 14>, <9, 15, 17>, <9, 15, 18>.
