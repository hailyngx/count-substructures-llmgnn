Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 14) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) 

Response:
