Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 3) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (14, 13) (14, 3) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 3 triangles in the given graph. 

[3]

The unique triangles are: <0, 4, 5>, <8, 11, 13>, <3, 7, 14>.
