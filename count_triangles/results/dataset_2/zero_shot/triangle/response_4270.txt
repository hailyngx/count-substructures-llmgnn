Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 9>.
