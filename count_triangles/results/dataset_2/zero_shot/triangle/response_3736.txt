Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 15) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 6) (10, 13) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 11) (3, 19) (3, 17) (3, 16) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 11) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 17) (7, 18) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 13) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 7) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 12) (1, 19) (1, 4) (16, 2) (16, 3)
