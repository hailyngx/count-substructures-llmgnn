Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 16) (11, 6) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 12) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 7) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 10) (7, 2) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 18) (4, 9) (4, 17) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (12, 19) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 16) (18, 12) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [48].
The unique triangles found are: <9, 10, 13>, <10, 12, 18>, <14, 9, 3>, <10, 12, 19>, <8, 1, 13>, <18, 12, 19>, <9, 6, 13>, <5, 14, 9>, <7, 16, 18>, <7, 10, 16>, <4, 17, 7>, <7, 16, 3>, <10, 15, 19>, <7, 17, 4>, <5, 19, 7>, <8, 18, 17>, <13, 6, 1>, <10, 15, 1>, <6, 9, 13>, <15, 19, 10>, <2, 0, 7>, <8, 1, 15>, <14, 3, 9>, <3, 16, 7>, <7, 19, 5>, <13, 1, 8>, <6, 11, 13>, <3, 14, 9>, <1, 15, 19>, <8, 3, 14>, <4, 17, 18>, <18, 16, 7>, <18, 8, 1>, <16, 7, 17>, <9, 10, 12>, <9, 6, 11>, <4, 17, 18>, <1, 8, 18>, <12, 19, 5>, <6, 9, 4>, <18, 17, 4>, <3, 8, 1>, <14, 5, 19>, <15, 10, 7>, <13, 10, 15>, <0, 2, 7>, <17, 7, 10>, <6, 13, 1>, <16, 18, 12>, <7, 10, 15>
