Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (3, 1) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 17) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 17) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 9) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 15) (13, 4) (13, 17) (15, 5) (15, 9) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 13) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 10) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 4) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 11) (6, 0) (6, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 16) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<8, 10, 16>
<4, 11, 18>
<4, 11, 8>
<4, 10, 16>
