Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 12) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 12) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
