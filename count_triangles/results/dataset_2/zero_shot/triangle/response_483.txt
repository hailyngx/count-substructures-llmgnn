Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 10) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
There are a total of [20] triangles in the graph. 

The unique triangles are:
