Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 6) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 0) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 9) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 2) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are <1, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <4, 5, 10>, <9, 12, 14>, <7, 9, 14>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 8, 10>, <1, 8, 10>, <3, 6, 12>, and <6, 12, 4>.
