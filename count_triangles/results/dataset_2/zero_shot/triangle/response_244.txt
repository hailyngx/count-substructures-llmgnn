Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (12, 6) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 1) 

Response:
