Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 0) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [10].

Here are the unique triangles:

<6, 0, 5>
<6, 9, 5>
<8, 4, 0>
<8, 4, 7>
<8, 4, 9>
<8, 4, 3>
<2, 1, 9>
<2, 1, 7>
<2, 1, 3>
<2, 1, 5>
