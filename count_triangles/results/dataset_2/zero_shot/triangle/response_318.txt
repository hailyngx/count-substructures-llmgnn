Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6)
