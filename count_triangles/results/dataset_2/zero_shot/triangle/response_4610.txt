Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 15) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 17) (9, 3) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 10) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 7) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 0) (6, 3) (14, 8) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 5) (15, 4) (15, 17)
