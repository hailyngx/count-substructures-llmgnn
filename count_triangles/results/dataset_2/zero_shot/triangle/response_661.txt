Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 0) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 19) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7) (7, 17) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 15) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (18, 6) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 14) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 8) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (3, 10) (14, 4) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 17) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 0)
