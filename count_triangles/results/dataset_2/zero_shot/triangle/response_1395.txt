Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 12) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 18) (13, 2) (13, 7) (4, 16) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 15) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 12) (1, 10) (1, 7) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 18) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 2) (15, 10) (3, 17) (3, 14) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 17) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 14) (18, 16) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 10) (12, 6) (12, 0) 

Response:
