Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <6, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 5>.
