Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 18) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 18) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 4) (3, 14) (3, 8) (11, 9) (11, 4) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 14) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 19) (18, 6) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 4) (2, 12) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (5, 17) (5, 15) (8, 3) (14, 3) (14, 15) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 0) (13, 9) (13, 0)
