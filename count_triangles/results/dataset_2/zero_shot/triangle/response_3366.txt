Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [18]. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 8, 5>, <2, 4, 3>, <2, 8, 5>, <2, 6, 3>, <3, 7, 0>, <3, 6, 5>, <4, 2, 8>, <4, 3, 7>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 1, 8>, <6, 5, 3>, <7, 5, 9>, <7, 2, 6>, <8, 1, 5>, <8, 2, 4>.
