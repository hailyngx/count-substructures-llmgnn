Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 18) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (18, 17) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 10) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 10) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 2) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (16, 8) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 11)
