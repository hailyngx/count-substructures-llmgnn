Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 2)
