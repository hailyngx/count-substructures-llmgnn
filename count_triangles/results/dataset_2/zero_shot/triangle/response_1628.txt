Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 9>.
