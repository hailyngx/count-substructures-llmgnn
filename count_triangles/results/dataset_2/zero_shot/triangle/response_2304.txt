Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 6) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 9) (8, 19) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 12) (19, 6) (19, 15) (19, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 7) (16, 12) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 18) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 1, 2>, <4, 9, 11>, <6, 12, 16>, <6, 7, 16>, <9, 12, 17>, <15, 19, 6>.
