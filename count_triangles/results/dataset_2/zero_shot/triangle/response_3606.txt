Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 10) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 1) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 1) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 1) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 12) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 4)
