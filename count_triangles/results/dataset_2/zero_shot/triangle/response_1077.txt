Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 14) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 5, 1>  
<2, 8, 3>  
<0, 12, 1>  
<0, 6, 1>  
<0, 6, 11>  
<2, 6, 10>  
<2, 8, 14>  
<2, 10, 11>  
<9, 13, 5>  
<11, 14, 8>
