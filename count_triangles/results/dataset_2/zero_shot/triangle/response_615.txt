Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 9)
