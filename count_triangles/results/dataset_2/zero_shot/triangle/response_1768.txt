Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 10) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (12, 9) (12, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) 

Response:
