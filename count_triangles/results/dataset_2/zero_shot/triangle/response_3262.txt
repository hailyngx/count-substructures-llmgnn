Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 15) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 18) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 18) (16, 15) (16, 0) (11, 4) (11, 0) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 19) (3, 13) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 13) (6, 8) (6, 18) (2, 7) (1, 19) (1, 8) (1, 18) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 1) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <3, 8, 15>, <3, 13, 17>, <3, 12, 7>, <3, 13, 6>, <3, 12, 7>, <3, 13, 0>, <3, 12, 7>, <0, 16, 15>, <0, 13, 6>, <0, 11, 4>, <0, 13, 6>, <0, 18, 10>, <0, 13, 17>, <0, 6, 18>.
