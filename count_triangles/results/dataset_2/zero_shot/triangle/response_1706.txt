Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 29) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 24) (6, 18) (6, 20) (9, 24) (9, 10) (7, 21) (7, 3) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 12) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 25) (0, 21) (0, 10) (0, 5) (20, 6) (20, 2) (20, 11) (1, 26) (1, 27) (1, 8) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 14) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 15) (29, 13) (29, 19) (29, 24) (10, 9) (10, 21) (10, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (12, 21) (12, 4) (3, 7) (3, 26) (3, 4) (3, 27) (19, 29) (19, 27) (14, 26) (14, 28) (11, 20) (11, 4) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 18) (25, 23) (25, 16) (15, 23) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 24) (15, 2) (17, 23) (17, 28) (27, 1) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 16) (2, 13) (2, 20) (2, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 15) (16, 8) (16, 25) (16, 27) (24, 22) (24, 9) (24, 29) (24, 15) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [26].
The unique triangles found are: <13, 5, 15>, <13, 5, 0>, <13, 5, 2>, <13, 29, 24>, <13, 29, 19>, <13, 22, 23>, <13, 22, 24>, <13, 22, 13>, <13, 22, 24>, <22, 23, 15>, <22, 23, 17>, <22, 23, 25>, <21, 7, 3>, <21, 7, 10>, <21, 7, 21>, <21, 7, 12>, <21, 10, 0>, <21, 10, 9>, <21, 10, 0>, <7, 21, 0>, <7, 21, 10>, <15, 5, 0>, <15, 5, 24>, <15, 5, 18>, <15, 2, 20>, <15, 2, 18>, <15, 24, 18>, <27, 16, 8>.
