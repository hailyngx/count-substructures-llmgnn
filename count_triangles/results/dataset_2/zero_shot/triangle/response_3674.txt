Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, and <1, 5, 9>.
