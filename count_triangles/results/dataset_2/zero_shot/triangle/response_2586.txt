Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [12].
The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 9, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 8>.
