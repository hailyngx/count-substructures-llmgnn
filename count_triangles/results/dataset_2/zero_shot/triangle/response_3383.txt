Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 15) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (18, 6) (18, 15) (19, 15) (19, 0) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 19) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 19) (3, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 10) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) (13, 14) (13, 1)
