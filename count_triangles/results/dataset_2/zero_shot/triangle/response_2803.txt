Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [28].
The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 6>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 1, 9>, <7, 1, 8>, <7, 3, 8>, <7, 6, 1>, <7, 6, 9>, <8, 1, 9>, <8, 2, 5>, <8, 4, 9>.
