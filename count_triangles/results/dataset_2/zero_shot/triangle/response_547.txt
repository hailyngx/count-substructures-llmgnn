Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 12) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 5) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 12) (5, 18) (5, 2) (5, 8) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 9) (13, 7) (13, 15) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 19) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 16) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 15) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 9) (9, 19) (9, 15) (14, 10) (14, 16) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <1, 3, 11>, <1, 10, 14>, <1, 11, 18>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 15>, <2, 8, 12>, <2, 16, 14>, <5, 8, 17>, <5, 18, 4>, <6, 7, 15>, <7, 13, 15>, <9, 15, 19>, <10, 11, 14>, <16, 12, 14>.
