Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 29) (13, 24) (22, 13) (22, 10) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 21) (9, 6) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 28) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 29) (8, 27) (23, 26) (23, 15) (23, 14) (28, 6) (28, 4) (28, 3) (28, 14) (26, 13) (26, 23) (26, 14) (27, 4) (27, 8) (27, 3) (27, 20) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 19) (15, 23) (15, 1) (21, 6) (21, 19) (21, 18) (11, 17) (11, 2) (10, 22) (10, 5) (14, 23) (14, 28) (14, 26) (14, 12) (3, 28) (3, 27) (3, 19) (3, 5) (24, 13) (24, 1) (24, 5) (24, 25) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 20) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 3) (5, 24) (5, 2) (0, 17) (0, 12) (29, 13) (29, 8) (20, 27) (20, 16) (18, 21) (18, 16) (18, 12) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 17) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 12) (25, 24) (19, 1) (19, 21) (19, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [64].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 7, 15>, <2, 5, 16>, <3, 5, 24>, <3, 5, 27>, <3, 14, 23>, <3, 19, 21>, <4, 16, 18>, <4, 16, 27>, <4, 27, 28>, <5, 24, 25>, <6, 9, 28>, <13, 22, 29>, <13, 26, 29>, <14, 23, 26>, <14, 12, 18>, <15, 19, 21>, <16, 18, 20>, <16, 18, 21>, <16, 20, 27>, <16, 20, 27>, <16, 20, 29>, <18, 21, 19>, <18, 21, 21>, <20, 16, 27>, <20, 16, 29>, <27, 20, 29>.
