Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are <4, 12, 13>, <6, 7, 3>, <6, 10, 3>, and <1, 6, 11>.
