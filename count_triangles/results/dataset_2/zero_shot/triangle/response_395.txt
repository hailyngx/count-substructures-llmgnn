Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (6, 16) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 7) (18, 8) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (5, 15) (5, 19) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 16) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 19) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 16) (16, 15) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 7) (8, 10) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 17) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 8) 

Response:
There are [46] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <5, 15, 16>, <8, 10, 17>, <1, 13, 19>, <9, 11, 13>, <2, 14, 17>, <16, 6, 7>, <9, 3, 10>, <4, 13, 19>, <0, 14, 2>, <16, 12, 7>.
