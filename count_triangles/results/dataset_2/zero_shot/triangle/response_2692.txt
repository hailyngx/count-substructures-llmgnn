Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14)
