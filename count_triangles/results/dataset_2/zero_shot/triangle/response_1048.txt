Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [20] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <4, 7, 9>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, and <6, 7, 9>.
