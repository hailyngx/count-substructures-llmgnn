Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 10) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 8) (7, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 15) (19, 16) (19, 12) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 15) (10, 16) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12)
