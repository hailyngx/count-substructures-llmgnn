Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: <4, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>
