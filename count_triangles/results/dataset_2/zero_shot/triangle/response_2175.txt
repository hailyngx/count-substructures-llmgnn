Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 14) (1, 8) (1, 14) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 14) 

Response:
There are [10] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are:

<4, 6, 13>
<3, 5, 11>
<3, 6, 14>
<2, 5, 12>
<2, 3, 14>
<2, 9, 10>
<1, 8, 14>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 13>
<0, 9, 13>
