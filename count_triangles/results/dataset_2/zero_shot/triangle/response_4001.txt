Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 12) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
[<0, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 12>, <1, 8, 12>, <2, 13, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 9, 13>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 14>, <6, 9, 14>, <9, 10, 13>]
