Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 2>, <3, 0, 8>, <3, 0, 4>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 6>.
