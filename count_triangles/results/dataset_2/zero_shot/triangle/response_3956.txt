Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 27) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 4) (6, 1) (6, 21) (6, 7) (9, 10) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 26) (17, 8) (17, 11) (29, 0) (29, 17) (4, 21) (4, 13) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 24) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 25) (24, 18) (24, 26) (24, 22) (26, 17) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 3) (7, 6) (7, 28) (7, 23) (25, 28) (25, 15) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 16) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 22) (10, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 23) (16, 27) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 25) (22, 14) (22, 24) (22, 10) (8, 17) (8, 20) (20, 8) (20, 27) (2, 0) (2, 13) (23, 7) (23, 16) (23, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 11) (27, 1) (27, 16) (27, 20) (27, 5) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 10) (5, 27) (5, 11) (3, 26) (3, 23) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is as follows:  

[<0, 14, 22> <0, 14, 15> <0, 2, 13> <6, 7, 23> <6, 21, 4> <6, 21, 28> <10, 22, 14> <10, 22, 24> <10, 22, 26> <10, 5, 27> <12, 14, 18> <12, 14, 16> <16, 19, 18> <17, 11, 13> <17, 26, 24> <17, 26, 10> <19, 18, 15> <26, 3, 23> <27, 1, 12> <27, 1, 19> <27, 1, 6> <27, 5, 11> <28, 21, 4> <28, 21, 6>]

[<0, 14, 15> <0, 2, 13> <6, 7, 23> <6, 21, 4> <6, 21, 28> <10, 22, 14> <10, 22, 24> <10, 22, 26> <10, 5, 27> <12, 14, 18> <12, 14, 16> <16, 19, 18> <17, 11, 13> <17, 26, 24> <17, 26, 10> <19, 18, 15> <27, 1, 12> <27, 1, 19> <27, 1, 6> <27, 5, 11> <28, 21, 4> <28, 21, 6>]

There are [22] triangles in the given graph.
