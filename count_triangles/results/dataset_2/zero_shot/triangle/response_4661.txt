Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 17) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 18) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 17) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 19) (10, 5) (10, 18) (10, 19) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 16) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 19) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 4) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (13, 4) (18, 6) (18, 10) (18, 17) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 16) (19, 14)
