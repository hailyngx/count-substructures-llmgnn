Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2)
