Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2)
