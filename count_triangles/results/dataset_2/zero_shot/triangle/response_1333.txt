Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 7) (16, 20) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 22) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 24) (0, 21) (27, 26) (27, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 3) (22, 5) (22, 23) (22, 10) (22, 20) (22, 3) (23, 22) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 28) (18, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 26) (1, 14) (26, 27) (26, 1) (21, 0) (28, 18) (28, 8) (28, 25) (28, 20) (17, 18) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 6) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 3) (13, 5) (24, 9) (24, 10) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 19) (20, 16) (20, 22) (20, 28) (20, 3) (10, 4) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 15) (10, 3) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (25, 28) (25, 17) (8, 11) (8, 27) (8, 28) (19, 4) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 6) (6, 16) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 29) (3, 20) (3, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [26].
The unique triangles found are <2, 18, 28>, <3, 10, 22>, <3, 6, 19>, <3, 20, 28>, <3, 22, 10>, <3, 22, 20>, <3, 22, 25>, <3, 29, 17>, <4, 7, 16>, <4, 9, 18>, <4, 9, 24>, <4, 9, 29>, <5, 9, 13>, <5, 9, 22>, <6, 12, 14>, <8, 11, 27>, <8, 27, 28>, <9, 18, 28>, <15, 19, 29>, <17, 18, 28>, <17, 25, 28>, <17, 25, 29>, <17, 25, 6>, <18, 28, 8>, <22, 28, 8>, <22, 28, 20>.
