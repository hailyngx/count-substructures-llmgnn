Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (2, 8) (2, 7) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 13) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 6) (9, 18) (9, 15) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (19, 16) (19, 6) (12, 17) (12, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 19) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 4) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 12) (16, 10) (16, 19) 

Response:
There are:
- 6 triangles with nodes <0, 5, 11>
- 6 triangles with nodes <0, 5, 8>
- 6 triangles with nodes <0, 8, 11>
- 6 triangles with nodes <0, 11, 12>
- 6 triangles with nodes <1, 7, 17>
- 6 triangles with nodes <2, 7, 8>
- 6 triangles with nodes <4, 5, 10>
- 6 triangles with nodes <4, 5, 13>
- 6 triangles with nodes <4, 10, 13>
- 6 triangles with nodes <6, 14, 15>
- 6 triangles with nodes <6, 14, 18>
- 6 triangles with nodes <6, 15, 19>
- 6 triangles with nodes <7, 8, 17>
- 6 triangles with nodes <7, 11, 13>
- 6 triangles with nodes <7, 13, 17>
- 6 triangles with nodes <7, 13, 18>
- 6 triangles with nodes <7, 15, 17>
- 6 triangles with nodes <9, 15, 18>
- 6 triangles with nodes <10, 11, 13>
- 6 triangles with nodes <10, 13, 16>
- 6 triangles with nodes <13, 17, 18>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [120].
