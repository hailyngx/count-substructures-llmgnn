Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) 

Response:
There are 42 unique triangles in the graph. Here are a few examples: 
<4, 9, 3>
<4, 9, 8>
<4, 1, 0>
<4, 1, 7>
<7, 6, 1>
<7, 6, 5>
[42]
