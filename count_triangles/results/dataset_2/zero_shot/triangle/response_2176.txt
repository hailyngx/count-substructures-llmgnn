Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 14) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [16]. 
The unique triangles are <9, 4, 12>, <2, 0, 5>, <2, 6, 11>, <2, 5, 9>, <13, 3, 4>, <1, 0, 5>, <1, 0, 2>, <1, 11, 13>, <1, 12, 13>, <10, 7, 3>, <14, 4, 13>, <14, 8, 10>, <14, 3, 4>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 0, 10>, <7, 3, 13>.
