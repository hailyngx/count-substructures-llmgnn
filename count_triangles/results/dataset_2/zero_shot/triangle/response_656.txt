Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (10, 7) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 14>, <4, 7, 14>, <3, 11, 13>.
