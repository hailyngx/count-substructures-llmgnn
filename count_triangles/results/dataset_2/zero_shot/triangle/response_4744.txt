Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 9) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 5) (10, 16) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (12, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 19) (5, 10) (5, 18) (5, 11) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 16) (0, 13) (0, 4) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 19) (18, 5) (18, 11) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 18) 

Response:
There are [32] triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles found: <1, 13, 14>, <4, 11, 18>, <3, 15, 10>, <3, 15, 16>, <3, 16, 19>, <6, 8, 13>, <6, 8, 4>, <6, 9, 13>, <10, 16, 3>, <1, 19, 6>, <5, 11, 18>, <4, 0, 13>, <4, 12, 0>, <1, 13, 0>, <5, 18, 11>, <6, 17, 10>, <4, 12, 11>, <3, 2, 1>, <3, 7, 14>, <15, 10, 17>, <1, 14, 7>, <10, 5, 11>, <2, 1, 19>, <9, 3, 15>, <9, 6, 17>, <9, 13, 1>, <8, 6, 19>, <8, 4, 12>, <13, 1, 2>, <15, 3, 7>, <17, 6, 9>, <16, 3, 2>
