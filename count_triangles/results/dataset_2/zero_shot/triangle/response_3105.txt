Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 15) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 15) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 6) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (9, 18) (9, 19) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 13) (1, 4) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 19) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 16) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 15)
