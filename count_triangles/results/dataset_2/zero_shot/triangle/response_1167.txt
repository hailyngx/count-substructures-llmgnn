Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 0>, <2, 8, 4>, <2, 8, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 4>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 9, 0>, <5, 7, 1>, <5, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 1>.
