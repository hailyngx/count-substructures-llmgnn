Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 6)
