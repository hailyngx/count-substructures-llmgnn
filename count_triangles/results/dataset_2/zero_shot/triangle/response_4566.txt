Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique triangles found are: <2, 6, 9> and <0, 4, 8>.
