Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 6) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 7) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 10>, <2, 4, 12>, <2, 4, 11>, <5, 7, 14>, <0, 9, 10>, <0, 9, 3>, <0, 12, 11>, <0, 12, 4>, <7, 11, 14>.
