Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (13, 6) (13, 2) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 3, 8>
<4, 0, 6>
<4, 10, 7>
<1, 11, 5>
<2, 11, 14>
<2, 13, 6>
<9, 12, 6>
<2, 10, 7>
