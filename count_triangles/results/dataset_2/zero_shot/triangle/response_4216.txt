Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 8) (4, 15) (4, 9) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 0) (10, 18) (8, 14) (8, 17) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 6) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 5) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 19) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 16) (11, 18) (11, 12)
