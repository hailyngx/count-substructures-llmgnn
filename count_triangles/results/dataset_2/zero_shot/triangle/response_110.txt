Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <0, 3, 6>, <8, 9, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, <6, 8, 3>, <0, 4, 3>, <3, 4, 8>.
