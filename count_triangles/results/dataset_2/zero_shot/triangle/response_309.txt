Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 2) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 14)
