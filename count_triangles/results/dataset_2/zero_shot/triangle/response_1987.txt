Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 8) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 1) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 11) (7, 9) (16, 5) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 11) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 2) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 8) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 15) (2, 11) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph.

[8]

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 15, 19>
<4, 12, 18>
<4, 1, 8>
<12, 0, 13>
<9, 10, 13>
<9, 13, 0>
<5, 6, 17>
<1, 4, 18>
