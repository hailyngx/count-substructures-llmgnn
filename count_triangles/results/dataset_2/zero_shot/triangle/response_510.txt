Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 10) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 11) (18, 9) (18, 17) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 12) (11, 17) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 15) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 19) 

Response:
There are [20] triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles found are:

<4, 5, 14>
<1, 13, 7>
<7, 10, 19>
<6, 9, 17>
<16, 10, 4>
<12, 14, 19>
