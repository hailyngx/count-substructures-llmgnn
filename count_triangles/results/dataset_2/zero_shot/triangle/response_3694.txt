Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are [18] triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are <3, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <8, 9, 6>, <3, 7, 9>.
