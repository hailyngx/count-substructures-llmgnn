Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 7, 9>, and <5, 6, 8>.
