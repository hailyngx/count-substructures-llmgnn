Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 7>, and <1, 4, 9>.
