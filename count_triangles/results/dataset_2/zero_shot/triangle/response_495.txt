Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are:
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 9, 4>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 4>
<9, 6, 4>
<9, 4, 7>
<9, 4, 0> 

So, the total number of triangles is [7].
