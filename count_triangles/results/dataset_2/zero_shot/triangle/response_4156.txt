Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 17) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 7) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 18) (2, 10) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 2) (7, 8) (7, 15) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 13) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 17) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [32]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 6, 17>, <0, 6, 14>, <0, 14, 18>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 11, 14>, <3, 11, 16>, <3, 1, 4>, <3, 12, 13>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 13, 12>, <6, 14, 18>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 1, 4>, <9, 15, 10>, <9, 11, 16>, <10, 15, 7>, <10, 18, 14>, <14, 11, 16>, <14, 12, 13>, <15, 9, 19>, <17, 6, 14>, <17, 18, 10>, <19, 2, 10>.
