Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 19) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 2) (6, 5) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 18) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 0) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 1) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 11) (12, 13) (12, 18) (19, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 18) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 13)
