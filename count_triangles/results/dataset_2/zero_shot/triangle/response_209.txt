Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 5) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 2) (9, 17) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 14) (1, 14) (1, 17) (7, 14) (7, 2) (5, 16) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 10) (19, 2) (19, 12) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 4) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 13) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 10)
