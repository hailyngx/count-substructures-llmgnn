Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 18) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 15) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 16) (2, 6) (2, 12) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 9) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) (17, 18) (17, 9) (17, 8) (12, 2) (12, 19) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 15) (9, 17) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 7) (8, 18) (8, 17) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 14)
