Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 12>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 3, 10>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 5, 13>, <1, 2, 12>, <1, 12, 14>, <2, 10, 12>, <2, 12, 13>, <2, 12, 14>, <2, 12, 11>, <2, 12, 1>, <2, 14, 0>, <3, 10, 12>, <3, 10, 6>, <4, 6, 10>.
