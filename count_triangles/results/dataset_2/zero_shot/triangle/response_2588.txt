Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) 

Response:
