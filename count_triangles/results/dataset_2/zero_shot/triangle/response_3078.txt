Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 18) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 0) (7, 9) (7, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (2, 4) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 15) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 16) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 5) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (19, 6) (19, 8) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 17) (15, 2) (15, 18)
