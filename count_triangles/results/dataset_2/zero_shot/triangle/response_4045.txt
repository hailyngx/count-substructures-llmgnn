Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 5) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2)
