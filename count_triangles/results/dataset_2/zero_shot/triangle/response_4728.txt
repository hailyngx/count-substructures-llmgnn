Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 10)
