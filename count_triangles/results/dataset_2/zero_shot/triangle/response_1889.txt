Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 19) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 17) (4, 5) (18, 9) (18, 1) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 2) (15, 10) (15, 0) (7, 8) (16, 13) (16, 12) (2, 17) (2, 5) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 19) (6, 1) (6, 14) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 14) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 19) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 5) (3, 8) 

Response:
