Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
The unique triangles are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <7, 8, 9>.
