Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 17) (9, 8) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 8) (5, 7) (5, 1) (13, 17) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 18) (16, 7) (16, 19) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 19) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 19) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 18) (19, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 19) (4, 17)
