Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 13) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 18) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (17, 18) (17, 16) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 19) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 15) (7, 11) (7, 19) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (4, 15) (9, 15) (9, 19) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 4) (19, 9) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 12) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 15) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 10, 14>, <0, 10, 12>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 4, 19>, <4, 9, 19>, <6, 1, 14>, <8, 12, 18>, <15, 4, 9>
