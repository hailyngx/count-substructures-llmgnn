Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <5, 4, 9>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 4, 1>.
