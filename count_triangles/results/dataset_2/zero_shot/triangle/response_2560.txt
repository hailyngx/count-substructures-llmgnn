Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 15) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 15) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 18) (3, 5) (3, 18) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 5) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 9) (16, 0) (16, 10) (12, 6) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (15, 4) (15, 2) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 0) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 5) (10, 16) (10, 18) (18, 6) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [22]. The unique triangles found are <2, 6, 12>, <4, 8, 13>, <5, 11, 14>, <9, 16, 0>, <17, 18, 19>.
