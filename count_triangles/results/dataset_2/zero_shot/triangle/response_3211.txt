Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14)
