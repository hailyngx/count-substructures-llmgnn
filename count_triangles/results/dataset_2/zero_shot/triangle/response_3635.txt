Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) 

Response:
There are [26] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 6, 12>, <0, 11, 14>, <0, 10, 12>, <0, 10, 9>, <1, 12, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 14>, <3, 5, 12>, <3, 5, 11>, <4, 8, 14>, <5, 6, 11>, <6, 0, 12>, <7, 2, 8>, <10, 0, 11>, <10, 0, 12>, <10, 3, 4>, <10, 9, 11>, <11, 5, 6>, <11, 9, 0>, <11, 14, 4>, <12, 6, 5>, <12, 0, 14>, <12, 0, 13>, <12, 10, 0>, <12, 10, 5>.
