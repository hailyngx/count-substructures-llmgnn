Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:

<5, 4, 7>
<5, 2, 4>
<5, 2, 0>
<9, 1, 4>
<9, 1, 0>
<3, 6, 2>
<6, 0, 8>
<6, 2, 0>
