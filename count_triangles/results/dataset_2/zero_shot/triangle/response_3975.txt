Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are: 
<6, 5, 4>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 1, 8>, <6, 3, 0>, <6, 3, 5>, <6, 3, 8>, <6, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 5, 8>, <7, 9, 2>, <7, 9, 0>, <7, 2, 1>, <2, 9, 7>, <2, 1, 8>, <0, 7, 1>.
