Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [20].
The unique triangles found are <6, 9, 12>, <6, 9, 10>, <6, 8, 12>, <6, 8, 10>, <6, 9, 11>, <9, 11, 0>, <1, 3, 10>, <1, 3, 0>, <3, 0, 5>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 2>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 4, 0>, <7, 0, 5>, <0, 3, 14>, <0, 3, 5>, <14, 3, 5>, <2, 8, 12>, <5, 0, 14>, <5, 11, 13>.
