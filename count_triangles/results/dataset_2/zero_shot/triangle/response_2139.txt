Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (14, 15) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (18, 9) (18, 12) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (0, 17) (0, 13) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 19) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 3) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 8) (15, 10) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 6) (6, 16) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 10)
