Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles are: <0, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>.
