Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (12, 14) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].  

The unique triangles found are:  
<3, 1, 6>

<3, 5, 10>  
<0, 4, 6>  
<0, 13, 2>  
<0, 13, 9>  
<0, 13, 14>  
<0, 2, 7>  
<0, 2, 13>  
<0, 9, 13>  
<2, 7, 13>  
<9, 13, 14>  
<10, 4, 6>  
<10, 5, 3>
