Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 14) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 12) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 1) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 12) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (4, 6) (4, 5) (4, 10)
