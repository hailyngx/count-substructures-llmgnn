Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are:
<0, 5, 12>
<0, 5, 13>
<0, 12, 6>
<0, 13, 1>
<8, 11, 1>
<8, 11, 13>
