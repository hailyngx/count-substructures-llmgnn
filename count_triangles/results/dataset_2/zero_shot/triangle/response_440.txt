Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 16) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 19) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (6, 17) (6, 7) (9, 18) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 16) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 16) (13, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (19, 1) (19, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 15) (12, 8) (12, 4) (16, 14) (16, 18) (16, 13) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (15, 17) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 0)
