Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13)
