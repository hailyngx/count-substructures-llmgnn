Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [14] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, and <5, 6, 7>.
