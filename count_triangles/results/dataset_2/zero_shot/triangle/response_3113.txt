Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 14) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<4, 8, 13>
<0, 10, 11>
<0, 9, 1>
<0, 2, 12>
<2, 6, 10>
<2, 7, 13>
<5, 6, 12>
<5, 14, 3>
