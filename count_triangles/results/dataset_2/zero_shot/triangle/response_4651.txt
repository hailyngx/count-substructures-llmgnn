Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (4, 6) (4, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [18]. 
The unique triangles found are <5, 8, 9>, <5, 11, 12>, <5, 9, 14>, <5, 8, 12>, <5, 11, 14>, <5, 9, 0>, <9, 6, 14>, <1, 11, 7>, <1, 10, 12>, <1, 10, 7>, <11, 10, 12>, <8, 11, 12>, <8, 13, 2>, <13, 3, 7>, <7, 10, 11>, <7, 11, 14>, <7, 2, 13>, <14, 4, 6>.
