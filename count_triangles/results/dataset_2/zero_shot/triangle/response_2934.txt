Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [20] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <4, 9, 8>, <4, 3, 1>, <4, 7, 1>, <9, 8, 4>, <9, 3, 1>, <7, 4, 1>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 0, 6>, <6, 8, 1>.
