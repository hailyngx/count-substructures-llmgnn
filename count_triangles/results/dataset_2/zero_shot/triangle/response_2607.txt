Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) 

Response:
Number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <1, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>
