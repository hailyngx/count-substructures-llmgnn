Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 2) (10, 15) (10, 16) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 15) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 14) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (19, 17) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 18) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 0)
