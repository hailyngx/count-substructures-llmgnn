Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
There are a total of [54] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 11, 14>, <0, 8, 14>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 8, 14>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 12>, <3, 7, 11>, <3, 7, 6>, <6, 7, 11>.
