Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 13) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are total [6] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <10, 14, 0>, <10, 14, 4>, <10, 14, 11>, <10, 13, 4>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 6>.
