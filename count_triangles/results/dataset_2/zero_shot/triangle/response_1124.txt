Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [24].
The unique triangles found are: <2, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 5, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 0>, <0, 4, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 3>, <7, 9, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <6, 7, 9>.
