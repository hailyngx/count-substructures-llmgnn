Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 14) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 21) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 9) (21, 23) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 20) (28, 1) (7, 22) (25, 27) (25, 0) (25, 12) (25, 11) (16, 17) (16, 27) (13, 21) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 27) (19, 9) (27, 25) (27, 16) (27, 5) (27, 10) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 29) (9, 24) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 26) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 13) (10, 27) (22, 7) (22, 24) (12, 25) (1, 28) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 29) (1, 4) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 26) (6, 0) (14, 15) (14, 23) (14, 2) (20, 21) (20, 24) (26, 29) (26, 6) (0, 8) (0, 25) (0, 6) (0, 24) (24, 9) (24, 22) (24, 20) (24, 0) (11, 25) (11, 5) (11, 4) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is **<16>** [82, 26, 25, 11, 1, 4, 13, 5, 27, 10, 21, 13, 17, 6, 26, 29].
