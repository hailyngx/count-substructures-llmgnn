Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 1) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <2, 13, 5>, <1, 6, 9>, <0, 9, 14>, <3, 4, 5>, <2, 11, 3>, <2, 13, 9>, <10, 4, 5>, <7, 1, 11>, <7, 9, 5>, <0, 11, 3>, <0, 9, 14>, and <1, 6, 7>.
