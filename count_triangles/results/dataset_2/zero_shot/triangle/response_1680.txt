Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 9) (6, 18) (6, 4) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 18) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 15) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 14) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 10) (7, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (12, 16) (12, 10) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 0) (15, 17) (15, 19) (2, 13) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2)
