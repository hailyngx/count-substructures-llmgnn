Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 14) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found are: <3, 4, 10>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 8, 13>, <9, 10, 13>, <9, 1, 12>, <1, 6, 12>, <8, 5, 12>, <13, 3, 14>, <8, 5, 14>, <8, 13, 14>, <10, 12, 13>, <3, 12, 14>.
