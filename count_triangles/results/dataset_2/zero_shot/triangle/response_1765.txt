Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are [10] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 11>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<5, 13, 14>
<6, 8, 0>
<6, 8, 2>
<6, 8, 3>
