Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 10) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 11) (5, 7) (5, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 6) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 17) (3, 16) (11, 18) (11, 4) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 8) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 8) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 9) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 16) (10, 7) (10, 14) (8, 15) (8, 6) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 9)
