Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 12) (0, 1) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
