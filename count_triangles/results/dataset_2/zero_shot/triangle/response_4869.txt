Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 4) (7, 5) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 0) (14, 11) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [4].

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 11>
<2, 4, 11>
<2, 5, 12>
