Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 12)
