Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, and <2, 6, 8>.
