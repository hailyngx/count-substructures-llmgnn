Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 3) (5, 13) (6, 10) (6, 0) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (1, 13) (1, 10) (17, 9) (17, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 16) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 15) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 12) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 3) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 15) (11, 4) (3, 18) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 19)
