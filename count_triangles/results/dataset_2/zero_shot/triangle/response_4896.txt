Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1)
