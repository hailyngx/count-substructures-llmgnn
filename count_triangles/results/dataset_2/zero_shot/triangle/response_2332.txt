Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [24].
The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 8>
