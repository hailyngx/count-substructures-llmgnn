Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [28].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<4, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <5, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 9>,
<0, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 8>,
<2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 0, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 2, 4>,
<4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 3, 6>, <4, 2, 5>, <4, 2, 9>, <4, 3, 9>,
<6, 7, 8>, <6, 3, 7>, <7, 0, 8>.
