Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<6, 9, 2>
<4, 9, 2>
<4, 3, 0>
<5, 4, 8>
