Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 14) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 18) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 15) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 0) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 17) (17, 19) (17, 12) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 1) (2, 0) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 10) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 15) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 15) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 6) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [24] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <2, 11, 16>, <2, 8, 13>, <2, 9, 15>, <2, 9, 1>, <2, 19, 18>, <2, 19, 17>, <2, 0, 5>, <13, 7, 4>, <13, 7, 8>, <13, 7, 6>, <13, 8, 4>, <13, 18, 16>, <13, 18, 15>, <13, 18, 19>, <13, 18, 15>, <3, 9, 4>, <3, 9, 5>, <3, 9, 1>, <3, 5, 0>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 9, 15>, <4, 13, 18>, <14, 8, 13>, <14, 15, 18>.
