Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 11) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 0) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 16) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 19) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 14) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 6) (13, 3) (13, 0)
