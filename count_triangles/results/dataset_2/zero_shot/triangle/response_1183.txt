Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 13)
