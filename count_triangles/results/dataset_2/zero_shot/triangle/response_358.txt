Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 8) (2, 7) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 1) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 12) (14, 16) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 18) (19, 12) (19, 15) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (4, 10) (4, 16) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 4) (16, 6) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 16)
