Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
There are 19 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
