Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 16) (1, 10) (1, 6) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 4) (9, 16) (9, 12) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 4) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 16) (3, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (19, 2) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 15) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 15) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 3) (16, 14) (16, 9) (16, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].

The unique triangles found in the graph are <10, 1, 6>, <10, 1, 17>, <10, 6, 15>, <10, 6, 17>, <2, 5, 11>, <2, 5, 16>, <2, 4, 15>, <5, 15, 7>.
