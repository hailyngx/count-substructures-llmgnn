Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14]. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 1, 9>, <7, 5, 1>, <7, 6, 2>, <3, 5, 1>, <3, 2, 5>, <2, 6, 5>, <2, 8, 0>, <2, 7, 5>, <8, 0, 6>.
