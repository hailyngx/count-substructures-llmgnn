Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 5) (15, 12) (15, 16) (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 0) (19, 5) (19, 7) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 4) (1, 13) (2, 12) (2, 16) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 2) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 19) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (6, 10) (6, 16) (18, 17) (18, 10) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 1) (16, 15) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

- Total number of triangles: [4]
- Unique triangles: <3, 0, 5>, <13, 3, 11>, <16, 2, 6>, <12, 9, 4>
