Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 5) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 4)
