Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 15) (5, 17) (5, 11) (5, 16) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 19) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 16) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 2) (11, 5) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 15) (19, 12) (19, 11) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<4, 16, 2>
<5, 16, 2>
<5, 11, 15>
<5, 18, 11>
<12, 7, 15>
<12, 9, 8>
<13, 2, 18>
<13, 4, 16>
<17, 1, 18>
<17, 14, 0>
