Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <5, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, and <6, 8, 9>.
