Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 6) (11, 18) (11, 15) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 12) (12, 9) (12, 6) (16, 17) (16, 19) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 14) (19, 16) (19, 15) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 16) (10, 3) (10, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 13) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 12) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 14)
