Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 17) (8, 7) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (0, 7) (0, 17) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 10) (13, 18) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 19) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 16) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 1) (16, 17) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 18) (12, 6) (12, 19) (10, 18) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 5) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<2, 6, 10>

<2, 10, 11>
<2, 10, 7>
<3, 9, 15>
<3, 14, 1>
<3, 17, 1>
<4, 13, 18>
<6, 12, 19>
<7, 10, 5>
<8, 17, 3>
<8, 17, 0>
<10, 7, 5>
<10, 18, 15>
