Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 12) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 17 triangles in this graph.
The unique triangles found are: <1, 4, 12>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 12, 13>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 14>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 12, 14>, <1, 13, 14>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 10, 13>, <9, 12, 14>, <9, 0, 12>, <9, 0, 3>, <9, 3, 12>, <0, 3, 12>, <8, 9, 14>
