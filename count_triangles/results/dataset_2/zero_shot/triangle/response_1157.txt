Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 10) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
Unique triangles found are <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 13>, <3, 6, 8>, and <3, 10, 4>.
