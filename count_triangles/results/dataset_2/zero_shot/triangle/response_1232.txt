Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 6) (12, 14) (12, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [26].
    
The unique triangles are <0, 5, 10>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 11>, <0, 11, 4>, <0, 11, 5>, <0, 9, 14>, <0, 9, 3>, <1, 10, 5>, <2, 13, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 11, 6>, <5, 13, 2>, <6, 8, 4>, <6, 11, 4>, <6, 13, 2>, <7, 8, 4>, <7, 9, 0>, <7, 9, 13>, <9, 11, 0>, <9, 11, 4>, <9, 14, 0>, <9, 14, 12>, <10, 1, 5>, <10, 12, 14>.
