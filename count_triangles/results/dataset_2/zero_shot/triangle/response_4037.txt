Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 15) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 12) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (1, 2) (1, 11) (6, 8) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 16) (19, 10) (19, 15) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 13) (5, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 16) (16, 15) (16, 9) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 3)
