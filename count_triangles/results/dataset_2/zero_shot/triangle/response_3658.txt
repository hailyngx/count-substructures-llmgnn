Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 15) (21, 14) (2, 29) (2, 11) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 19) (22, 23) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 6) (4, 27) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 3) (15, 21) (15, 8) (15, 19) (20, 3) (20, 19) (20, 28) (20, 10) (6, 22) (6, 23) (6, 28) (28, 1) (28, 20) (28, 6) (28, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 17) (27, 21) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 14) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 20) (19, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 17) (16, 4) (16, 10) (10, 20) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 9) (25, 2) (25, 23) (25, 27) (25, 9) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 9) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 13) (17, 26) (17, 0) (18, 10) (18, 11) (3, 8) (3, 20) (3, 9) (14, 21) (14, 27) (14, 13) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 12) (12, 11) (13, 28) (13, 9) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<25, 27, 9>
<2, 11, 8>
<19, 9, 13>
<6, 22, 23>
<4, 14, 27>
<1, 21, 28>
<6, 23, 28>
<10, 16, 18>
<0, 1, 5>
<9, 13, 14>
<8, 11, 18>
<3, 9, 13> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
