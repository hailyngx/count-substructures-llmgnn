Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 9) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (7, 19) (13, 17) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 15) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 0) (0, 19) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 12) (2, 17) (2, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 18) (5, 14) (5, 18) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of 29 triangles in this graph.
The unique triangles found are: <6, 11, 16>, <1, 10, 12>, <8, 15, 17>, <2, 9, 17>, <5, 14, 18>, <1, 10, 14>, <1, 12, 18>, <6, 14, 18>, <8, 15, 18>, <10, 12, 18>, <1, 10, 18>, <12, 14, 18>, <0, 7, 19>, <8, 16, 17>, <6, 15, 18>, <6, 11, 15>, <11, 15, 18>, <6, 8, 15>, <6, 8, 16>, <2, 6, 9>, <9, 12, 18>, <6, 9, 14>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 3, 4>, <14, 15, 18>, <5, 14, 17>, <11, 15, 16>, <11, 14, 17>.
