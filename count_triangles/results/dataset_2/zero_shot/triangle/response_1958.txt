Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 13) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <5, 9, 10>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 4, 12>, <1, 8, 12>, <1, 8, 2>, <4, 9, 5>, <4, 6, 11>, and <4, 13, 2>.
