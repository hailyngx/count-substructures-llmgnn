Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 11) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 6) (7, 14) (7, 6) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 19) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 1) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 13) (19, 12) (19, 8) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 18) (0, 15) (0, 13) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 16) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 13>, <0, 2, 15>, <0, 13, 15>, <2, 13, 15>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 6, 10>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 6, 11>, <4, 6, 13>, <8, 1, 13>, <8, 1, 15>, <8, 2, 13>, <8, 2, 15>, <8, 19, 12>, <10, 6, 11>, <15, 16, 18>.
