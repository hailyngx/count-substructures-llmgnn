Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
