Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 15) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 13) (17, 3) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 10) (18, 5) (18, 15) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 19) (19, 14) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 10) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 0) (5, 18) (5, 2) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 18) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 2) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [14]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 12, 2>, <0, 4, 16>, <0, 12, 9>, <0, 12, 14>, <1, 8, 15>, <2, 5, 18>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 10, 19>, <3, 7, 15>, <3, 9, 2>, <3, 9, 12>, <3, 9, 19>, <3, 17, 13>, <4, 13, 16>.
