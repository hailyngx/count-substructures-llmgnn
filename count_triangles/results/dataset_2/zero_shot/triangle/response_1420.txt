Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 13) 

Response:
[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 12>, <0, 5, 12>, <0, 12, 14>, <1, 7, 14>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 10>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 7, 9>]
