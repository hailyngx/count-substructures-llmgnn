Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 10) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 19) (9, 22) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 18) (5, 12) (5, 15) (5, 7) (0, 20) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 16) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 15) (11, 29) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 16) (25, 13) (25, 1) (25, 28) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (18, 26) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 3) (1, 26) (1, 10) (1, 25) (1, 24) (2, 4) (2, 24) (28, 26) (28, 25) (28, 19) (28, 24) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 21) (21, 27) (21, 6) (21, 17) (3, 10) (3, 20) (3, 18) (7, 5) (7, 29) (7, 14) (7, 17) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 28) (29, 11) (29, 7) (29, 12) (29, 14) (16, 27) (16, 20) (17, 21) (17, 7) (17, 12) (15, 5) (15, 11) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 17) (12, 24) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 29) (24, 27) (24, 1) (24, 2) (24, 28) (24, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph: [<3, 10, 20> <7, 12, 17> <10, 11, 15> <18, 19, 28>]. The total number of triangles is [4].
