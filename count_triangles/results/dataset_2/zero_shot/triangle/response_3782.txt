Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<1, 3, 2>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <5, 8, 7>, <2, 8, 7>, <0, 7, 9>.
