Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 0) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) (19, 7) (19, 12) (15, 6) (16, 13) (16, 17) (12, 4) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 18) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 8) (7, 19) (17, 16) (17, 2) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 12) (18, 6) (18, 14) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 12, 18>
<2, 13, 17>
