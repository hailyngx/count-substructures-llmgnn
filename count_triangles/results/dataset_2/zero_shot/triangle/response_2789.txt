Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 5)
