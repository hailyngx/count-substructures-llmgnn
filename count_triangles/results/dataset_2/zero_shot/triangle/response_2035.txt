Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14)
