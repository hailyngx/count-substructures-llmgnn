Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 18) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 17) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 15) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 16) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 15) (18, 5) (18, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 9) (16, 14) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 12) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 16) (0, 11) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 6)
