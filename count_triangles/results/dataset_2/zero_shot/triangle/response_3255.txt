Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found are <4, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, and <2, 7, 8>.
