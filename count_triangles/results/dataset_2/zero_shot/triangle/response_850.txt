Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 14) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3)
