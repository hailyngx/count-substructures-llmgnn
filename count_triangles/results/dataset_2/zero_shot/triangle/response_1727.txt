Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 9, 2>, <7, 8, 1>, <7, 9, 1>. The total number of triangles is [16].
