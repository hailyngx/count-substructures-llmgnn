Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (0, 14) (0, 15) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 7) (15, 0) (15, 1) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 16) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [10], and they are:

<13, 11, 18>
<13, 10, 7>
<13, 10, 3>
<13, 8, 11>
<13, 2, 12>
<11, 7, 10>
<11, 4, 18>
<11, 4, 17>
<10, 7, 3>
<10, 5, 14>
