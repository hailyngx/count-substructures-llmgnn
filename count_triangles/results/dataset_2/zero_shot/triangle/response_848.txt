Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles found: <1, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 1, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <5, 6, 9>
