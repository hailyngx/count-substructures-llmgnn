Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (11, 9) (11, 5) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 10) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <1, 3, 12>, <1, 3, 14>, <1, 10, 13>, <1, 12, 14>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 10>.
