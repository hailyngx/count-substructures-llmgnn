Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 9, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 2>, <5, 9, 7>, <5, 2, 6>, <5, 6, 1>, <7, 0, 8>, <7, 5, 9>, <7, 0, 6>, <8, 5, 9>, <8, 3, 6>.
