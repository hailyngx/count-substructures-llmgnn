Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
