Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
