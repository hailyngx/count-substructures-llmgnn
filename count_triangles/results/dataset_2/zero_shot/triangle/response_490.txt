Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 5) (0, 16) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 9) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 18) (2, 16) (2, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 17) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 6) (13, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 12) (19, 10) (19, 1)
