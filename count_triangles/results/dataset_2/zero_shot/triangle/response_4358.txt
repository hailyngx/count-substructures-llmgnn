Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 17) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 15) (18, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 11) (19, 5) (19, 4) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 10) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 17) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (10, 6) (10, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7)
