Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 12) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 13) (5, 4) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 7) (13, 10) (13, 5) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 5) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (15, 17) (15, 18) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 19) (7, 8) (16, 10) (16, 3) (16, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 18) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 16) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<4, 5, 14>
<4, 5, 17>
<6, 7, 17>
<6, 7, 19>
<10, 12, 14>
<0, 6, 7>
