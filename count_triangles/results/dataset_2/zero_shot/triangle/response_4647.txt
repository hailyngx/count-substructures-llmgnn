Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 12) (11, 4) (11, 13) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13)
