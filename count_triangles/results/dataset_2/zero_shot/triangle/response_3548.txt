Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 11) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 8) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 14) (19, 8) (19, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (2, 12) (2, 6) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 15) (12, 1) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (18, 10) (18, 12) (3, 6) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 3) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 15) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 16) (16, 4) (16, 1) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 5)
