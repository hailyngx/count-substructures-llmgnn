Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 18) (10, 14) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (19, 5) (19, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 7) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 1) (17, 18) (17, 8) (17, 15) (4, 11) (4, 19) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 8) (1, 14) (15, 18) (15, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 12)
