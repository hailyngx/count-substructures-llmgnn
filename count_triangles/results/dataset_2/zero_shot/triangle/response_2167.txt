Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 0) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 14) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11)
