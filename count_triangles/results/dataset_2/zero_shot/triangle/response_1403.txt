Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (16, 8) (3, 15) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 12) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (5, 8) (19, 10) (19, 4) (8, 16) (8, 18) (8, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 14) (13, 3) (13, 7) (17, 15) (17, 4) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 4) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 1)
