Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the example above, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 13) - 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 13) - 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. Node 2:
    - No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 13) - 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - No more possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (0, 7) - 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - No more possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. Node 6:
    - No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
    - No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8:
    - No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
    - No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. Node 10:
    - No possible triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. Node 11:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 11.
    - No possible triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. Node 12:
    - No possible triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

14. Node 13:
    - No possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. Node 14:
    - No possible triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

16. Node 15:
    - No possible triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

17. Node 16:
    - No possible triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

18. Node 17:
    - No possible triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

19. Node 18:
    - No possible triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

20. Node 19:
    - No possible triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles = 1 (Node 0)

[Total number of triangles in the graph: 1]
