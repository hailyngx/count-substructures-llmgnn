Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. But, neither 14 nor 18 are directly connected to 0. No triangle formed.
