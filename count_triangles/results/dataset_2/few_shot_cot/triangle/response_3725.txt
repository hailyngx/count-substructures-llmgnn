Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 29) -> 4 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (29, 13) -> 29 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9.

    * No possible triangles with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (29, 4) -> 29 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangles with Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (17, 16) -> 17 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangles with Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles with Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with Node 19.

* Node 20:
    * No possible triangles with Node 20.

* Node 25:
    * No possible triangles with Node 25.

* Node 26:
    * No possible triangles with Node 26.

* Node 27:
    * No possible triangles with Node 27.

* Node 28:
    * No possible triangles with Node 28.

* Node 29:
    * No possible triangles with Node 29.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 16) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
