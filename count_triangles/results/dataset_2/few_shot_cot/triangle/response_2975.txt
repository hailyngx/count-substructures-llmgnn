Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 and calculate the final number of triangles.
