Response:
Following the step-by-step process discussed earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 29) -> 2 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 29 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 28) -> 9 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 12 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only relevant pair is (12, 24) -> Both 12 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (28, 9) -> 9 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 28 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

The calculations for the rest of the nodes in the graph will be continued in subsequent messages to avoid exceeding the character limit.
