Response:
Following the same procedure as the example provided above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 4) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 12) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 2) - Connected, forms a triangle with node 8 using edge (13, 8).
    * Pair 6: (13, 4) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) - Connected, but no triangle formed because no edge between nodes 6 and 8.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 3 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Only 1 pair available, (6, 10) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pair (7, 2) as it involves Node 2 which is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 13 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

The final answer is [1].
