Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) - 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) - 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node:
        * 6 and 0 are directly connected, forming a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (13, 6) - 13 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other valid pairs left.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other valid pairs left.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other valid pairs left.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other valid pairs left.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other valid pairs left.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other valid pairs left.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) - 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) - 4 and 11 are directly connected, check for the third node:
        * 11 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle <4, 7, 11>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) - 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) - 9 and 2 are directly connected, check for the third node:
        * 2 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle <2, 8, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) - 9 and 10 are directly connected, check for the third node:
        * 10 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle <8, 9, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other valid pairs left.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 14 are skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
