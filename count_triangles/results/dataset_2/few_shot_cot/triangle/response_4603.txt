Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair as there are no nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No more nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
