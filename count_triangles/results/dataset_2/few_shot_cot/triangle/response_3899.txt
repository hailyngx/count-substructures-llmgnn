Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 9 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 0 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Since there are not at least two nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9, no triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
