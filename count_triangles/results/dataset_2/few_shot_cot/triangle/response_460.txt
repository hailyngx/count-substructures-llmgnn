Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 25) -> 4 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 25 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 26) -> 4 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 0 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as all possible neighbors are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 15 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 20) -> 8 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 20 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 8) -> 8 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* For Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7: 
    - Node 4 forms 1 triangle.
    - Nodes 5, 6, and 7 do not form any triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 18 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * No triangles formed as no pairs of 1-hop neighbors are directly connected.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No new triangles formed compared to previous calculations.

* Node 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22:
    * No triangles formed with these nodes.

* Node 23:
    * Pair 1: (13, 27) -> 13 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 23, and 13 and 27 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * No triangles formed with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
