Response:
Following the step-by-step process as described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
