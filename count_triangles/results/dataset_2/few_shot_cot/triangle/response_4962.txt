Response:
Following the process outlined in the example given, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 5) and form a triangle with node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) - Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (9, 13), forming a triangle with node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (7, 8), forming a triangle with node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip, as there are no neighbors with a number greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (7, 8), forming a triangle with node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) - Both 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (9, 10), forming a triangle with node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 as it is smaller than 10.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) - Both 11 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are directly connected as (11, 17), forming a triangle with node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12 and Node 13:
    * No new triangles can be formed with these nodes.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 13 as it is smaller than 14.

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 22 and 28 as they are smaller than 15.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 11 and 22 as they are smaller than 17.
    * Pair 1: (17, 22) - Both 17 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 17, and they are directly connected as (17, 22), forming a triangle with node 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18 and Node 19:
    * No new triangles can be formed with these nodes.

* Node 20:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 as it is smaller than 20.

* Node 21:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 11 as it is smaller than 21.

* Node 22:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 17 as it is smaller than 22.

* Node 23, Node 24, and Node 25:
    * No new triangles can be formed with these nodes.

* Node 26, Node 27, and Node 28:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes.

* Node 29:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 29.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 17) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
