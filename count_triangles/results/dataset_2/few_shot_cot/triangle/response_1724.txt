Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 20) -> Both 7 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 20) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (19, 24) -> 19 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (19, 24) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes 0 and 1 due to smaller node numbers.
    * Pair 1: (29, 18) -> Both 29 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (29, 20) -> Both 29 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (29, 20) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (29, 7) -> Both 29 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skip remaining pairs as they involve nodes with smaller numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 23) -> Both 15 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 9) -> Both 15 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 28) -> Both 9 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (4, 15) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 3 due to smaller node numbers.
    * Pair 1: (14, 22) -> Both 14 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (14, 10) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 due to smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * ...
    * Continue this process for Nodes 6 through 9, and beyond up to Node 29.
