Response:
Following the method outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in this graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (19, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (19, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 2) -> Node 3 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than the individual node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is: [0].
