Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Not connected as (0, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> Not connected as (0, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> Not connected as (0, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 3) -> Not connected as (0, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected as in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected as in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 2) -> Not connected as (1, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are connected as in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 1) -> Not connected as (2, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are connected as in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are connected as in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Not connected as (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are connected as in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 0) -> Not connected as (3, 0) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped in the same way as Node 4 due to the absence of nodes with higher numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
