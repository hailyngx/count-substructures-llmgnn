Response:
Following the same method described in the example, let's count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (13, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they share an edge (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Nodes 9-14) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph. 
The unique triangle found is <4, 5, 6>.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
