Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the example provided, I will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 2) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Remaining Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9: 
    * All these nodes have triangles with other nodes considered before. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + Triangles with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 = 8.

Therefore, there are [8 triangles] in the given graph.
