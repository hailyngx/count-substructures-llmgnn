Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are not connected because the edge (1, 10) is not in the list. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not connected because the edge (7, 10) is not in the list. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not connected because the edge (7, 12) is not in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not connected because the edge (7, 13) is not in the list. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are not connected because the edge (6, 10) is not in the list. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are not connected because the edge (8, 11) is not in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
