Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (1, 2) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 7: (2, 7) -> Connected, they are 1-hop neighbors, so forming a triangle.
    * Pair 8: (2, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 9: (2, 12) -> Connected, they are 1-hop neighbors, so forming a triangle.
    * Pair 10: (5, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 11: (5, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 12: (5, 12) -> Connected, they are 1-hop neighbors, so forming a triangle.
    * Pair 13: (7, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 14: (7, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 15: (10, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Connected, they are 1-hop neighbors forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.  

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
