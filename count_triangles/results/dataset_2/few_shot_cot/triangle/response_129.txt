Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected as shown in the edges list. No other triangle can be formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edges list. No other triangle can be formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are not directly connected. No other triangle can be formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edges list. No other triangle can be formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edges list. No other triangle can be formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are all smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as shown in the edges list. No other triangle can be formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Try all possible pairs, but no triangles can be formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edges list. No other triangle can be formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edges list. No other triangle can be formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8 as they are all smaller than 9. No other triangle can be formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
