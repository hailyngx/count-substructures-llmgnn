Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (8, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (13, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * There are no possible triangles with size 2 or larger that can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4 through 14:
    Continuing in the same manner as above, we find the number of triangles for each of the remaining nodes as follows:
    * Node 4: 2
    * Node 5: 2
    * Node 6: 0
    * Node 7: 3
    * Node 8: 3
    * Node 9: 3
    * Node 10: 2
    * Node 11: 1
    * Node 12: 0
    * Node 13: 3
    * Node 14: 2

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 3 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) = 24.

Therefore, there are 24 triangles in the given graph.
