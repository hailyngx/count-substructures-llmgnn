Response:
Following the example given, let's count the triangles in the graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 11 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Only one neighbor (5), no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are connected to Node 2 as 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 4) -> 12 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (15, 14) -> 15 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 15 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (15, 10) -> 15 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (19, 18) -> 19 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 11 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there are not at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
