Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 0 since it does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors with higher node numbers.

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 1 since it does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors with higher node numbers.

* Node 2:
    - Triangle: <1, 2, 13>

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 3 since it does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors with higher node numbers.

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 4 since it does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors with higher node numbers.

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 5 since it does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors with higher node numbers.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 6 since it does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors with higher node numbers.

* Node 7:
    - Triangle: <4, 7, 12>

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 8 since it does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors with higher node numbers.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 9 since it does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors with higher node numbers.

* Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 10 since it does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors with higher node numbers.

* Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 11 since it does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors with higher node numbers.

* Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 12 since it does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors with higher node numbers.

* Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 13 since it does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors with higher node numbers.

* Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 14 since it does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors with higher node numbers.

Summarizing the triangles:
[<1, 2, 13>, <4, 7, 12>]
