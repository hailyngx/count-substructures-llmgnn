Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Connected through Node 1: Triangle formed <0, 1, 14>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Connected through Node 1: Triangle formed <0, 1, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Connected through Node 4: Triangle formed <1, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Connected through Node 9: Triangle formed <1, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Connected through Node 6: Triangle formed <1, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Connected through Node 5: Triangle formed <2, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> Connected through Node 7: Triangle formed <2, 7, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Connected through Node 10: Triangle formed <3, 10, 14>.
    * Pair 2: (13, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 9) -> Connected through Node 13: Triangle formed <3, 9, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Connected through Node 5: Triangle formed <4, 5, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Connected through Node 8: Triangle formed <6, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Connected through Node 8: Triangle formed <7, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 12.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
