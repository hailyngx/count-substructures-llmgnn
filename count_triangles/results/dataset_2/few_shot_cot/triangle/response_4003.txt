Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 8) -> 12 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 12 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, and 8 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 10

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
