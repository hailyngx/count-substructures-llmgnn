Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the previous example, here are the triangles formed for each node in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>.
        * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 13>.
        * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 13>.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> Triangle formed: <1, 5, 10>.
        * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> Triangle formed: <1, 5, 14>.
        * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>.
        * Pair 4: (10, 13) -> Triangle formed: <1, 10, 13>.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Triangle formed: <3, 8, 12>.
        * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Triangle formed: <6, 7, 12>.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Triangle formed: <7, 11, 13>.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed: <8, 1, 5>.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 10:
        * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Triangle formed: <10, 11, 13>.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 11:
        * Pair 1: (14, 1) -> Triangle formed: <11, 14, 1>.
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 12:
        * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed: <12, 3, 8>.
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 13:
        * Pair 1: (14, 0) -> Triangle formed: <13, 14, 0>.
        * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 14:
        * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 14.
        * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 14.

Therefore, there are [14] triangles in the given graph.
