Response:
Following the same method as the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are connected, but 2 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are connected, but 2 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 13) -> 18 and 13 are connected, but 18 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
