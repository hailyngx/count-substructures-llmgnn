Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * No triangles formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are not connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected and 1-hop neighbors.
    * No triangles formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are connected and 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are connected and 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are connected and 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3 ( <2, 4, 3>, <2, 4, 10>, <2, 4, 13>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors.
