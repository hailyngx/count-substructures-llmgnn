Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least two nodes greater than any of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
