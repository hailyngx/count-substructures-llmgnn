Following the same method as the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the graph. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 24) -> 7 and 24 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
