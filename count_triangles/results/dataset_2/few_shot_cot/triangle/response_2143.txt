Response:
Following the step-by-step approach to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 19) -> Both 10 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 19) -> Both 12 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> Node 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> Node 5 and 19 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (with Node 5 and Node 19)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (22, 21) -> Both 22 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (22, 17) -> Both 22 and 17 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 20) -> Both 22 and 20 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (with Node 17 and Node 22)

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (14, 20) -> Node 14 and 20 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (with Node 14 and Node 20)

* Nodes 6, 7, 15, 27:
    * Skipped as they do not have enough connections to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (16, 12) -> Both 16 and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (with Node 12 and Node 16)

Continuing this process for the rest of the nodes:

* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 12
* Node 13: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 13
* Node 14: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 14
* Node 16: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 16
* Node 17: 1 triangle
* Node 18: 1 triangle
* Node 19: 1 triangle
* Node 20: 1 triangle
* Node 21: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 21
* Node 22: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 22
* Node 23: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 23
* Node 24: 1 triangle
* Node 25: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 25
* Node 26: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 26
* Node 28: Skip, as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 28
* Node 29: 1 triangle

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 1 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 1 (Node 29) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
