Response:
Following the same methodology as demonstrated in the example:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 22) -> 4 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (4, 24) -> 4 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 5: (8, 22) -> 8 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 7: (8, 24) -> 8 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 8: (22, 10) -> 22 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 9: (22, 24) -> 22 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 10: (10, 24) -> 10 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 10 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
            * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 22) -> 2 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (13, 22) -> 13 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Node 2 does not form any triangles with its 1-hop neighbors.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (7, 26) -> 7 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (15, 26) -> 15 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Node 4 does not form any triangles with its 1-hop neighbors.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Continue this process for Nodes 5 through 29...
