Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 12) -> Connected through Node 1
    - Pair 2: (4, 16) -> Connected through Node 1
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 12) -> Connected through Node 2
    - Pair 2: (4, 19) -> Connected through Node 2
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (12, 16) -> Connected through Node 3
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (12, 19) -> Connected through Node 4
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (12, 16) -> Connected through Node 6
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Connected through Node 7
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    - Pair 1: (14, 19) -> Connected through Node 8
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Connected through Node 10
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (14, 19) -> Connected through Node 11
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (19, 14) -> Connected through Node 12
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (15, 17) -> Connected through Node 13
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    - Pair 1: (19, 4) -> Connected through Node 14
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    - Pair 1: (6, 12) -> Connected through Node 16
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    - Pair 1: (15, 18) -> Connected through Node 17
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 15.

Therefore, there are [15] triangles in the given graph.
