Response:
Following the step-by-step process demonstrated in the example, the count of triangles in the provided graph will be calculated by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 11.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 11.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 1.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 0.
    * Pair 5: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed because Node 5 and Node 10 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed because Node 5 and Node 13 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed because Node 5 and Node 10 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 and Node 13.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> No triangle formed because Node 9 and Node 11 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed because Node 9 and Node 14 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these correspondingly.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the final answer is [11].
