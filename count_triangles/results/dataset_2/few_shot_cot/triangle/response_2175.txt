Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, here are the counts for triangles formed around each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed since 0 and 3 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed since 0 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed since 8 and 14 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed since 2 and 3 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed since 2 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider as all connected nodes are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed since 6 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 6 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as all connected nodes are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed since 6 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped for the same reason as mentioned in the previous example as they do not have at least 2 larger connected nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
