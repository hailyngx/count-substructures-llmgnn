Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step by considering each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 22) -> 4 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 22 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 22) -> 17 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (17, 22) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 10 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 24) -> 10 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (10, 24) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 10 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

This process will continue for the remaining nodes to find all the triangles in the graph. Let's continue with the rest of the nodes.
