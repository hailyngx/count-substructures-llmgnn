Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) - 12 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 21) - 12 and 21 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 21) - 14 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 28) - 8 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 15) - 8 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) - 8 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (28, 15) - 28 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (28, 2) - 28 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (15, 2) - 15 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (25, 7) - 25 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (27, 18) - 27 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (27, 10) - 27 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 10) - 18 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5 to 29:
    * Skipped for the same reasons as above nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + ... + 0 (Node 29) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
