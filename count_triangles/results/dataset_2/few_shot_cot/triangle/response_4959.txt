Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    - Skip, as it does not have 2 connected nodes to form a triangle.

* Node 1:
    - Skip, as it is not connected to any other nodes.

* Node 2:
    - Skip pair (2, 7) since 2 < 7.
