Response:
Following the same process from the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) - Direct edge exists between 12 and 15. They are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed with 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) - Direct edge exists between 6 and 10. They are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed with 1.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) - Direct edge exists between 6 and 14, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed with 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Direct edge exists between 4 and 9. They are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed with 2.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) - Direct edge exists between 9 and 12. They are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed with 2.
    * Pair 3: (8, 18) - Direct edge exists between 8 and 18. They are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed with 2.
    * Pair 4: (8, 12) - Direct edge exists between 8 and 12. They are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed with 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle for Node 3 as there is only one connection.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Direct edge exists between 7 and 9. They are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed with 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) - No direct edge between 7 and 15. They are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 14) - Direct edge exists between 15 and 14. They are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed with 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) - Direct edge exists between 1 and 10. They are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed with 6.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) - Direct edge exists between 1 and 14. They are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Direct edge exists between 4 and 5. They are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed with 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 18) - Direct edge exists between 2 and 18. They are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed with 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle for Node 9 as there is only one connection.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13 are all skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater in number to form a triangle with them.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) - Direct edge exists between 1 and 10. They are not 1-hop neighbors of 14. No triangle formed with 14.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) - Direct edge exists between 1 and 13. They are not 1-hop neighbors of 14. No triangle formed with 14.
    * Pair 3: (1, 18) - No direct edge between 1 and 18. They are not 1-hop neighbors of 14. No triangle formed with 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 do not have any triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater in number to form triangles with them.

Summing up the total triangles formed with each node as the smallest numbered node:
Total triangles = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 14) = 0

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **[0]**.
