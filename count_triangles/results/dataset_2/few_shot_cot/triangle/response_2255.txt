Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they form a triangle with node 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No valid triangle can be formed with node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * All possible pairs have a node smaller than 7, so no triangle can be formed with 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No valid triangle can be formed with node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
