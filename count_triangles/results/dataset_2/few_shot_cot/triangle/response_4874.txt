Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with only one connection.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Since it has already been considered in the analysis for Node 0, it's skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Only one connection, no triangle possible.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as they are all larger than 9 and have been analyzed in the previous steps.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
