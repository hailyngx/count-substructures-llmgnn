Response:
Following the example described earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 6) -> Not considered as it's a loop.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of each other. They form a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of each other. They form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

And so on for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Finally, count the total number of triangles by summing all the triangles from each node:

Total triangles in the graph: [5]
Unique triangles found: <2, 5, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 0, 9>, <6, 3, 9>
