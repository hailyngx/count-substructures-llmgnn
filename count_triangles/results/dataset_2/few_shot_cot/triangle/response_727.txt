Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0: Skipped as there are no pairs that involve Node 0.
- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (13, 15) -> Both 13 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 13, 15>.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (10, 15) -> Both 10 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 10, 15>.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 9, 13>.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <5, 6, 7>.
    - Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <6, 9, 17>.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <7, 8, 10>.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Both 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <8, 10, 16>.
    - Pair 2: (8, 13) -> Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <6, 9, 17>.
    - Pair 2: (9, 18) -> Both 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Both 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <8, 10, 16>.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 11 to 20:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 10.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
Unique triangles found: <1, 13, 15>, <2, 10, 15>, <4, 9, 13>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 9, 17>, <7, 8, 10>, <8, 10, 16>.
