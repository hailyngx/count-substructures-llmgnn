Response:
Following the example provided, I will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Let's check if there exists a third node which is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0 and connected to both 4 and 8. This is not the case. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Let's check if there exists a third node which is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0 and connected to both 4 and 3. This is the case for Node 2, making a triangle <0, 4, 3>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Let's check if there exists a third node which is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0 and connected to both 4 and 2. This is the case for Node 2, making a triangle <0, 4, 2>.
    * Pair 4: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Let's check if there exists a third node which is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0 and connected to both 8 and 3. This is not the case. No triangle formed.
