Response:
Following the example given above, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 18) -> Triangle formed with Node 15: <0, 2, 18>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> Triangle formed with Node 15: <1, 17, 18>
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <0, 2, 15>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Only nodes adjacent to Node 19, so no triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <0, 2, 15>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Only adjacent to Node 4, so no triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 10. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 11. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Only adjacent to Nodes 13 and 16, so no triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 13. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 14. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 18: <0, 2, 15>
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 17: <0, 1, 17>
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 16. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 17. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 18. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Only adjacent to Nodes 14 and 13, so no triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 2 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
