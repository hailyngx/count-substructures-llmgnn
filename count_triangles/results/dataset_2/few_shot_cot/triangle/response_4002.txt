Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

14. Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

16. Node 15:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

17. Node 16:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

18. Node 17:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

19. Node 18:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

20. Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Calculating the total number of triangles by summing up the counts for each node:
Total triangles = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
