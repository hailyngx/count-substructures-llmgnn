Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 21) - 4 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) - 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node that can form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (14, 21) - 14 and 21 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
