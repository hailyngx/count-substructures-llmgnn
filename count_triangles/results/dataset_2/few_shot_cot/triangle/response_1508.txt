Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 12) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (17, 1) -> 17 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (18, 1) -> Skip as the earlier node is smaller. No new triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip other nodes as they are smaller than 3. No new triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with nodes greater than 6.

Summarizing the triangles found:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
