Response:
Following the same steps as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip node 2 as it is smaller than 3.
    * No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip node 4 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip node 4 as it is smaller than 7.
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip node 9 as it is smaller than 8.
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
