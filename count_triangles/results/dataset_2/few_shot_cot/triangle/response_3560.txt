This problem involves counting the number of triangles in the given graph. Let's go node by node to calculate the total number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles found for each node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [8].
