Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (2, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be considered as there are no other nodes greater than 5. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 0 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 9) -> 12 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 12 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no other nodes greater than 9. No triangle formed.

* Node 10:
    * No pairs can be considered as there are no other nodes greater than 10. No triangle formed.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and 4 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and 6 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no other nodes greater than 13. No triangle formed.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no other nodes greater than 14. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
