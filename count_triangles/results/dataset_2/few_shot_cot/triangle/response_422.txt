Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are directly connected, forming a triangle with node 0.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are directly connected, forming a triangle with node 0.
    * Pair 6: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are directly connected, forming a triangle with node 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are directly connected, forming a triangle with node 2.
    * Pair 3: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 5) -> 10 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 0) -> 10 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are directly connected, forming a triangle with node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each one to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
