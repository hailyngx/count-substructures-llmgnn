Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 0, 8, and node 2

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, here is how the triangles are counted for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <0, 4, 1>
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <0, 4, 6>
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9: <0, 4, 8>
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 1, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 4, 6>
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <1, 6, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <2, 7, 9>
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <2, 3, 6>
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <1, 2, 5>
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9: <2, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <2, 7, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 8 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
