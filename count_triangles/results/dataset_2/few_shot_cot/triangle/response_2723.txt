Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3)

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 1 are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 1 are also connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 0 are also connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 8 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 2 are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 2 are also connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 2 are also connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 3 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 3 are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 3 are also connected.
    * No more nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Next, we will proceed with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 to count the triangles.
