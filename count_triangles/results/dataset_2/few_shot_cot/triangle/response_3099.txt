Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 5, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are connected as (0, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are connected as (0, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with nodes 1, 4, and 9.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed with nodes 1, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Triangle formed with nodes 1, 7, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with nodes 3, 4, and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with nodes 4, 5, and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Triangle formed with nodes 8, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Triangle formed with nodes 9, 4, and 1.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Triangle formed with nodes 9, 7, and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, the answer is [11].
