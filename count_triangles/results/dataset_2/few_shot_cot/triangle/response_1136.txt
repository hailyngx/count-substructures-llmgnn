Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (28, 29) -> 28 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (29, 6) -> 29 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 29 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 19 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 18 are directly connected, triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected, triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected, triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are not enough nodes to form triangles with node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 21) -> 7 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected, triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (18, 2) -> 18 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected, triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip as there are no pairs that can form a triangle with node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 26) -> 11 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Proceeding with this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 0 triangles
* Node 22: 0 triangles
* Node 23: 0 triangles
* Node 24: Skipped
* Node 25: 0 triangles
* Node 26: 0 triangles
* Node 27: Skipped
* Node 28: 0 triangles
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
