Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Same as earlier, skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Same as earlier, skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 21) -> 13 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 28) -> 13 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 29) -> 0 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 16:
    * All nodes are smaller than 17, so just skip them.

* Node 17:
    * Same as earlier, skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 18 to 23:
    * All nodes are smaller than 24, so just skip them.

* Node 24:
    * Pair 1: (5, 29) -> 5 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 24, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 25 to 29:
    * All nodes are smaller than 30, so just skip them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 2.
Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
