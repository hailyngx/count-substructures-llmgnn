Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will determine the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * <2, 4, 8> - 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected. 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected. 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * <3, 9, 13> - 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected. 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected. 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Other nodes) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
