Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, let's count the triangles formed by each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Same as above where we found the triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipping because they are smaller than nodes 8 and 9 and don't have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [8].
