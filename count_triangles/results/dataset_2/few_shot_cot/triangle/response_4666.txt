Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 24) -> 5 and 24 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 27) -> 5 and 27 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (24, 27) -> 24 and 27 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 20) -> 10 and 20 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 26) -> 10 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 26) -> 20 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 28) -> 15 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are connected. Triangle formed: <13, 4, 17>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 17) -> 18 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (16, 24) -> 16 and 24 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 to 13:
    * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than 8.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (13, 28) -> 13 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 15 to 21 and 23:
    * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than 15, 21, and 23.

* Node 22:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 21 as they are smaller than 22.
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 24:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 23 as they are smaller than 24.
    * Pair 1: (17, 23) -> 17 and 23 are connected. Triangle formed: <17, 24, 23>.
    * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 25 to 29:
    * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than 25.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
