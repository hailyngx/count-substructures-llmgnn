Response:
Following the step-by-step approach mentioned in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 20) -> 3 and 20 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 21) -> 3 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (15, 20) -> 15 and 20 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (15, 21) -> 15 and 21 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (20, 21) -> 20 and 21 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (20, 19) -> 20 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (21, 19) -> 21 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Proceeding with the same methodology for the rest of the nodes in the graph...

* Node 1:
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle formed with 5, 9, 18)

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 to 29:
    * Following the same calculations as above, we find that there are no triangles with Nodes 8 to 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Nodes 0-7) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6, 7) + 0 (Nodes 8-29) = 1.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
