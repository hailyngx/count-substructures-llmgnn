Response:
Following the example provided, let's compute the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> Both 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 20) -> Both 2 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 25) -> Both 2 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (20, 25) -> Both 20 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 18) -> Both 2 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> Both 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 11) -> Both 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * There are no pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> Both 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> Both 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Continue this process for Nodes 5 to 29 as well, computing the total number of triangles for each node.

* After calculating for all nodes, sum up the total number of triangles for each node.

* Finally, output the final answer inside brackets based on the total triangles found in the graph.
