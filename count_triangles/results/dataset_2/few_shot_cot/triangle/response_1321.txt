Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) - Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) - Forms a triangle with Node 0 and Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip the pairs with Node 0 and Node 1 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip the pairs with Node 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip the pairs with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) - Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 9.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip the pairs with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip the pairs with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [7].
