Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 26) -> 5 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 16) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other; hence, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as it only has one neighbor.

Continue this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 3: 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4: 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5: 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6: 
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7: 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8: 
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9: 
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10: 
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11: 
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12: 
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13: 
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14: 
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15: 
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16: 
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17: 
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18: 
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19: 
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 20: 
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 21: 
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 22: 
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 23: 
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 24: 
    * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 25: 
    * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 26: 
    * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 27: 
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 28: 
    * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 29: 
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 13
[13]

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
