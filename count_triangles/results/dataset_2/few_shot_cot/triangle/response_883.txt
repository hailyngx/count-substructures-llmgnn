Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 25) -> 12 and 25 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 28) -> 15 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 25) -> 15 and 25 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor pair for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor pair for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 22) -> 4 and 22 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor pair for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (24, 29) -> 24 and 29 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor pair for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor pair for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor pair for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 21) -> 9 and 21 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor pair for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor pair for triangle formation.

Continuing this process for Nodes 11 to 29:

- Node 11: 
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 12: 
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 13: 
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 14: 
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 15: 
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 16: 
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 17:
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 18:
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 19:
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 20:
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 21:
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 22:
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 23:
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 24:
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 25:
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 26:
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 27:
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 28:
    - Total triangles: 0
- Node 29:
    - Total triangles: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + ... + 0 (Node 29) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
