Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found within the graph are:
[<0, 4, 14>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 9, 5>, <4, 6, 14>, <5, 2, 9>, <6, 14, 4>, <11, 14, 4>, <13, 6, 14>]
