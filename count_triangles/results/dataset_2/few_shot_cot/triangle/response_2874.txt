Response:
Following the example provided, I will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (19, 8) -> 19 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 21) -> 19 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 21) -> 8 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 24) -> 1 and 24 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4 to 8:
    * Skipped because they are smaller than Node 9.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (26, 2) -> 26 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (26, 7) -> 26 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * Skipped because they are smaller than Node 20.

* Node 20:
    * Pair 1: (29, 22) -> 29 and 22 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (29, 24) -> 29 and 24 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 24) -> 22 and 24 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 21 to 29:
    * Skipped because they are smaller than Node 30.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 20) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
