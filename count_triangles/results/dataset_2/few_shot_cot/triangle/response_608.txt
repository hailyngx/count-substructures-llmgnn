Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 10) -> Both 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 13) -> Both 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (9, 10) -> Both 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (10, 13) -> Both 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3 

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair involving Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Process nodes 3 to 14 similarly as above: 
    - Node 3: 0 triangles
    - Node 4: 0 triangles
    - Node 5: 3 triangles
    - Node 6: 2 triangles
    - Node 7: 2 triangles
    - Node 8: 3 triangles
    - Node 9: 3 triangles
    - Node 10: 3 triangles
    - Node 11: 6 triangles
    - Node 12: 0 triangles
    - Node 13: 0 triangles
    - Node 14: 0 triangles

Calculating the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles from each node: 
Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 23.

Therefore, there are [23 triangles] in the given graph.
