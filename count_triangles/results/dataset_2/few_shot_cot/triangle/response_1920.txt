Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 9 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 14:
    * Skipped because they don't have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = [3]

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
