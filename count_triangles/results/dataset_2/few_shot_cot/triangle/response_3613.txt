Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> Both 18 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> Both 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (0, 18) -> 0 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 12) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. [3]
