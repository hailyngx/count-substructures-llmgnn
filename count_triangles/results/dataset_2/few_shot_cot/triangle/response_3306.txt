Response:
Following the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both connected to Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both connected to Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are both connected to Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, 1, 2, 3).
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are connected to Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Since Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes, there can be no triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected to Node 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Same as Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9: 
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12).
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
        
The final answer is [2].
