Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

- Node 0:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 0.
    - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 9). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 4). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (10, 4) -> Both 10 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (10, 4). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 8.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 9.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 10.
    - Pair 1: (2, 11) -> Both 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected as (2, 11). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 11:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 11.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 12:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 12.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 13:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 13.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 13.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 14:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 14.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 14.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. [4]
