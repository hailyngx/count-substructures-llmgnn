Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as illustrated in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the graph based on each node. 

Calculating the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 4, and 3. <0, 4, 3>
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 4, and 7. <0, 4, 7>
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 4, and 9. <0, 4, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 1, 4, and 11. <1, 4, 11>
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed as 11 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 2, 8, and 5. <2, 8, 5>
    * Pair 2: (8, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 2, 8, and 3. <2, 8, 3>
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 2, 8, and 11. <2, 8, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 3, 8, and 11. <3, 8, 11>
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed as 11 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 5: 1 triangle
* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 2 triangles
* Node 8: 1 triangle
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles

Adding up the total number of triangles: 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 12

Therefore, there are [12 triangles] in the given graph.
