    * Node 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
        * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 16.

Therefore, [16] triangles are in the given graph.
