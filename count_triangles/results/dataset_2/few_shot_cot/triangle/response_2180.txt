Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 21) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (28, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (28, 21) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (29, 21) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 23) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 23) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
  
* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving Node 0, Node 1, or smaller nodes are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (24, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (24, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs involving Node 1, smaller nodes, or nodes already considered are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes or nodes already considered are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes or nodes already considered are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes or nodes already considered are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes or nodes already considered are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes or nodes already considered are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes or nodes already considered are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes or nodes already considered are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes or nodes already considered are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes or nodes already considered are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes or nodes already considered are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18:
    * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Continuing to count triangles for the remaining nodes...

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (17, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (20, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (20, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 20:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes or nodes already considered are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 21:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes or nodes already considered are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 22, Node 23, Node 24, Node 25, Node 26, Node 27, Node 28, and Node 29:
    * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
