Response:
Let's go node by node to count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are directly connected as (0, 1) and (0, 8) are in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 8 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> Both 17 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 17 and 19 are directly connected as (17, 19) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (23, 25) -> Both 23 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 23 and 25 are directly connected as (23, 25) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with the given nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:

    * No possible triangles with the given nodes.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (25, 27) -> Both 25 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, but 25 and 27 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25:
    * No possible triangles with the given nodes.

* Node 26:
    * No possible triangles with the given nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 27, 28, 29:
    * No possible triangles with the given nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the answer is [6].
