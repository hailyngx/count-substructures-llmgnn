Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 13 are directly connected as (3, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 13 are directly connected as (3, 13) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 13 are directly connected as (11, 13) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 4 are directly connected as (0, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 0 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 8 and 10 are directly connected as (8, 10) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, we calculate the total number of triangles in the graph:

* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
