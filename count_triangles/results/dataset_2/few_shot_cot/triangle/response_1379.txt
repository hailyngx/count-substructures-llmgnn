Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No more nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No more nodes greater than 8 to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
