Response:
Following the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

Starting with Node 0:
* Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
* Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Moving on to Node 1:
* Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
* Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Now, analyzing Node 2:
* Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
* No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

Now, examining Node 3:
* Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
* No other triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

For Node 4:
* Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
* No other triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

Moving to Node 5:
* Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
* No other triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

For Node 6:
* Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
* No other triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

Analyzing Node 7:
* Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
* No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

Now, checking Node 8:
* Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
* No other triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

Finally, for Node 9:
* Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
* No other triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
