    * Pair 4: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are connected.
    * Pair 5: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
