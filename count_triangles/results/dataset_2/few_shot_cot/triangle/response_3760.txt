Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 10 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 10 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 10 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 10 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Follow a similar process for Node 3, considering its 1-hop neighbors and their connections.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: ?

Please continue this process for Nodes 3 to 14, and we will calculate the total number of triangles in the final step after considering all nodes.
