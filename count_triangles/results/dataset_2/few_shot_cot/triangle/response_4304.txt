Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 19) -> 12, 13, and 19 form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs involving nodes greater than or equal to these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
