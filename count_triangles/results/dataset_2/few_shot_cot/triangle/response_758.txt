Response:
Following the example from earlier, I will find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:
  
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (20, 28) -> 20 and 28 are not connected because (20, 28) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (21, 15) -> 21 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (21, 15) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 23) -> 21 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 21 and 23 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 10 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 10 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (25, 17) -> 25 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 25 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (25, 20) -> 25 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 25 and 20 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (15, 1) -> 15 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (15, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 25) -> 15 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 15 and 25 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (28, 20) -> 28 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 28 and 20 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (29, 25) -> 29 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 29 and 25 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (29, 6) -> 29 and 6 are not connected because (29, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 23) -> 8 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 23 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 20) -> 8 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 20 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 8, 9, and 10:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles found so far:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are listed as follows in square brackets:
[<1, 10, 24>, <3, 17, 25>, <3, 20, 25>, <4, 15, 25>, <5, 20, 28>, <6, 25, 29>, <7, 8, 23>, <7, 8, 20>, <10, 12, 13>, <10, 12, 16>]
