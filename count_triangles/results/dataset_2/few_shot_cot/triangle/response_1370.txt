Response:
Following the same method as explained in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

This process will be continued for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10 triangles] in the given graph.
