Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (9, 14) - Connected through Node 1 forming a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (0, 9) - Connected through Node 9 forming a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (0, 16) - Connected through Node 16 forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) - Connected through Node 1 forming a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) - Connected through Node 7 forming a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (1, 14) - Connected through Node 14 forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 17) - Connected through Node 17, but (4, 17) not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 16) - Connected through Node 16 forming a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (2, 19) - Connected through Node 19 forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (15, 9) - Connected through Node 9 forming a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (3, 4) - Connected through Node 4 forming a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (3, 15) - Connected through Node 15 forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (2, 17) - Connected through Node 17, but (2, 17) not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) - Connected through Node 6 forming a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (4, 18) - Connected through Node 18 forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for Nodes 5 to 19 (skipping nodes with no triangles).

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 13.

Therefore, [13] triangles are present in the given graph.
