Response:
Following the same process as described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 2) -> Both 10 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> Both 12 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> Both 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 0) -> Both 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 12) -> Both 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 12) -> Both 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> They are already considered when Node 1 was the smallest, so skip.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Both 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6 to 14:
    * Skipping because they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
