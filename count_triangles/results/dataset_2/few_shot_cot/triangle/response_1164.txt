Response:
Following the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's connections. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 13 are connected as (2, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with the nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with the nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with the nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (8, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (6, 14) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (6, 12) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 12) -> Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 12 are directly connected as (4, 12) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 14) -> Both 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 14 are directly connected as (4, 14) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (4, 11) -> Both 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 11 are directly connected as (4, 11) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node >9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 14 will be skipped as there aren't at least two nodes greater than them for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 6 (Node 4) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
