Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph and list them within brackets at the end. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> Both 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 17) -> Both 3 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 1) -> Both 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 1) -> Both 11 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> Both 8 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) -> Already counted when looking at Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> Already counted when investigating Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
[<3, 11, 0>, <8, 12, 1>, <12, 19, 4>, <11, 17, 5>, <10, 17, 6>, <4, 6, 11>]

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
