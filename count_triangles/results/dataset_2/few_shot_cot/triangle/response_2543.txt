Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (8, 26) -> 8 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (10, 23) -> 10 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (10, 7) -> 10 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * No pairs to consider as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (2, 27) -> 2 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 26) -> 2 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (8, 24) -> 8 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (11, 10) -> 11 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * No pairs to consider as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (1, 27) -> 1 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 24) -> 4 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (25, 29) -> 25 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (25, 20) -> 25 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 10:
        * Pair 1: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (13, 28) -> 13 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 11 to 29:
        * So far, we haven't found any triangles for nodes larger than 10, so all the pairs involving these nodes will not form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
