Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 12.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 10.
    * Pair 4: (8, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 and Node 12.
    * Pair 5: (8, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 and Node 10.
    * Pair 6: (12, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 12 and Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 7 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 13 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 14 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 4 and 12 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7.

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
