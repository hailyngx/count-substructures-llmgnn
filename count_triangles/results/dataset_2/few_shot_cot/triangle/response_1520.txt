Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as before, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: Skipped because no two nodes are connected to Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 26) -> Both 5 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 26 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 26) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (20, 23) -> Both 20 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 20 and 23 are not directly connected as there is no edge (20, 23) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 29) -> 5 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 29 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 29) -> 13 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 13 and 29 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 6 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> Both 8 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 8 and 15 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 15) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 25) -> Both 9 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 9 and 25 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 25) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: Skipped because no other nodes are larger than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

I will now continue this process for the remaining nodes.
