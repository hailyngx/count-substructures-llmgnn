Response:
Following the same example step-by-step process, we will now find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 10 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 10). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 1 are also connected as (4, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> Both 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> Both 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 3) -> Both 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 3 are directly connected as (8, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 14) -> Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 8 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 will give the total number of triangles in the graph.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = Calculated triangles for each node added together.
* The final answer should be enclosed in brackets as follows [answer].

Now, let's proceed with finding the total number of triangles in the graph.
