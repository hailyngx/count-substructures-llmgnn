Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (9, 0) -> Node 0, 9, 5 form a triangle <0, 9, 5>.
    - Pair 5: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (3, 0) -> Node 0, 3, 7 form a triangle <0, 3, 7>.
    - Pair 7: (7, 0) -> Node 0, 7, 2 form a triangle <0, 7, 2>.
    - Pair 8: (0, 2) -> Node 0, 2, 5 form a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Node 1, 5, 9 form a triangle <1, 5, 9>.
    - Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Node 1, 8, 4 form a triangle <1, 8, 4>.
    - Pair 4: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Node 2, 5, 7 form a triangle <2, 5, 7>.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Node 2, 5, 8 form a triangle <2, 5, 8>.
    - Pair 4: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 7) -> Node 2, 3, 7 form a triangle <2, 3, 7>.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (7, 0) -> Node 3, 7, 2 form a triangle <3, 7, 2>.
    - Pair 2: (0, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

- Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
