Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 because (4, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
