Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, here is the breakdown of counting triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Connected in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pair with Node 1 as it's smaller.
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs including Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 16) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pair with Node 1 as it's smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pair with Nodes 1 and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 4 and 8 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 6 and 7 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pair with Node 4 as it's smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
