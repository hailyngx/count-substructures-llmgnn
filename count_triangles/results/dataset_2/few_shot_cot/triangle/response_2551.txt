Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, I will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) - These nodes are connected to Node 0 but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 1) - No triangle formed as node 1 is not connected to node 10.
    * Pair 3: (18, 1) - No triangle formed as node 1 is not connected to node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already processed.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no other nodes greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already processed.
    * Pair 1: (15, 9) - These nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 and connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (15, 4) - These nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 9, 15>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 5) - These nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 8) - These nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already processed.
    * Pair 1: (12, 11) - These nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already processed.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no other nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already processed.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no other nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already processed.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) - These nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7 and connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<7, 9, 13>)

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already processed.
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) - These nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 8 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already processed.
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) - These nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9 and also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [2].
