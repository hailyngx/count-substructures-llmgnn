Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (15, 22) -> 15 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (15, 23) -> 15 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (25, 14) -> 25 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (25, 4) -> 25 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. **Node 2:**
    - Pair 1: (3, 22) -> 3 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (17, 22) -> 17 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (15, 20) -> 15 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.

    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, we find the total number of triangles:

27. **Node 26:** 0
28. **Node 27:** 0
29. **Node 28:** 1
30. **Node 29:** 0

Finally, summing up the triangles for all nodes:
[1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0] = 16.

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.
