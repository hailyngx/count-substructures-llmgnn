Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will determine the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) - Both 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) - Both 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) - Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) - Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5 and Node 6:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 5 or 6.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (9, 8), but since 9 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
