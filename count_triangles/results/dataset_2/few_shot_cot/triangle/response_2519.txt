Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (1, 3, 4). No other pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with at least two greater numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
