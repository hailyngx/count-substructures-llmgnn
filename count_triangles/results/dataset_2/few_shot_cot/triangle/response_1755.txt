Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step starting from each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - Nodes 9 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) - Nodes 9 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) - Nodes 4 and 1 are connected. But they are not connected to Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) - Nodes 4 and 8 are connected. They are connected to Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) - Nodes 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Nodes 4 and 7 are connected. They are connected to Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) - Nodes 4 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) - Nodes 7 and 3 are connected. They are connected to Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) - Nodes 7 and 1 are connected. They are connected to Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) - Nodes 5 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Nodes 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - Nodes 4 and 7 are connected. They are connected to Node 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) - Nodes 4 and 2 are connected. But they are not connected to Node 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Nodes 5 and 9 are connected. They are connected to Node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Nodes 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) - Nodes 9 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) - Nodes 7 and 1 are connected. They are connected to Node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) - Nodes 7 and 1 are connected. They are connected to Node 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) - Nodes 7 and 3 are connected. They are connected to Node 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) - Nodes 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Since no triangles were formed with the nodes provided, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
