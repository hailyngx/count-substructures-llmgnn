Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> 1 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 17) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected (1, 18 is not in the edge list). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (17, 18) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 15) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (24, 25) -> 24 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (17, 22) -> 17 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (17, 22) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 29) -> 2 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 21) -> 6 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (6, 21) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Pair 1: (2, 23) -> 2 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (2, 23) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10 to 29:
    * Skipped because they do not have at least 2 nodes with higher numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

[<1, 17, 18>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 15, 26>, <4, 17, 22>, <6, 21, 23>, <9, 2, 23>]
