Response:
Following the same process as described in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 0 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
