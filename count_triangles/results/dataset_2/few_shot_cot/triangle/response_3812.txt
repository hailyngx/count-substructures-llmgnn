Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 6, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No possible triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
