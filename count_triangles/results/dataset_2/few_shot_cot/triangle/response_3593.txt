Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (8, 12) - Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes than 4.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  * Pair 1: (12, 14) - Both 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
  * Pair 1: (3, 13) - Both 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
  * Pair 1: (5, 12) - Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
