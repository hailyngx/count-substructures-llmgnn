Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

After counting the triangles for each node, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
