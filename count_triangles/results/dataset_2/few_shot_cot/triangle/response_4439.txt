Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- For Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Triangle formed: <0, 10, 13>
  - Pair 2: (10, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 10, 14>
  - Pair 3: (13, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 13, 14>
  - No more possible pairs for Node 0.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- For Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  - No more possible pairs for Node 1.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- For Node 2:
  - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
  - No more possible pairs for Node 2.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- For Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
  - No more possible pairs for Node 3.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- For Node 4:
  - Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Triangle formed: <4, 8, 12>
  - No more possible pairs for Node 4.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- For Node 5:
  - Pair 1: (1, 11) -> No triangle formed.
  - No more possible pairs for Node 5.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- For Node 6:
  - Pair 1: (0, 12) -> No triangle formed.
  - No more possible pairs for Node 6.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- For Node 7:
  - Pair 1: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
  - No more possible pairs for Node 7.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- For Node 8:
  - Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Triangle formed: <8, 13, 10>
  - No more possible pairs for Node 8.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- For Node 9:
  - Pair 1: (2, 14) -> No triangle formed.
  - No more possible pairs for Node 9.
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- For Node 10:
  - Pair 1: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed.
  - No more possible pairs for Node 10.
  - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- For Node 11:
  - Pair 1: (3, 13) -> Triangle formed: <11, 3, 13>
  - Pair 2: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed.
  - No more possible pairs for Node 11.
  - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- For Node 12:
  - Pair 1: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
  - No more possible pairs for Node 12.
  - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- For Node 13:
  - No more possible pairs for Node 13.
  - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- For Node 14:
  - No more possible pairs for Node 14.
  - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
[<0, 10, 13>, <0, 10, 14>, <0, 13, 14>, <4, 8, 12>, <8, 13, 10>, <11, 3, 13>]
