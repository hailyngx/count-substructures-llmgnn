Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the steps from the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) <br>
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) <br>
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) <br>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) <br>
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) <br>
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) <br>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) <br>
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) <br>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) <br>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles possible with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles possible with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles possible with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) <br>
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) <br>
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) <br>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) <br>
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) <br>
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) <br>
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) <br>
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) <br>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
