Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 0 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Already counted when considering Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs already counted in previous nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 14 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skipping pairs already counted in previous nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 10 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and 11 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (12, 4) -> Already counted when considering Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, and 14 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
