Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3)

Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> No direct edge between 1 and 9. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No direct edge between 4 and 9. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No direct edge between 2 and 9. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No direct edge between 4 and 9. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No direct edge between 6 and 9. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes to form triangles with. 
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes to form triangles with. 
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs with larger nodes for both 8 and 9 to form triangles.
  
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
