Response:
Following the example provided, we will follow the same process to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 23) -> Triangle with nodes 0, 6, 23.
    * Pair 2: (6, 22) -> Triangle with nodes 0, 6, 22.
    * Pair 3: (23, 22) -> Triangle with nodes 0, 23, 22.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> Triangle with nodes 4, 15.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> Triangle with nodes 4, 16.
    * Pair 3: (8, 16) -> Triangle with nodes 4, 8, 16.
    * Pair 4: (8, 15) -> Triangle with nodes 4, 8, 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> Triangle with nodes 5, 17.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (15, 22) -> Triangle with nodes 6, 15, 22.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> Triangle with nodes 9, 16.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> Triangle with nodes 14, 15.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (17, 5) -> Triangle with nodes 17, 5.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 20:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 21:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 22:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 23:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 24:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 26:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 27:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 28:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

Now, we count the total number of triangles:

Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 17) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
