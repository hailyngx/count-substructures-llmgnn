Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected because (1, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because they all have fewer than at least 2 nodes greater than their node number to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
