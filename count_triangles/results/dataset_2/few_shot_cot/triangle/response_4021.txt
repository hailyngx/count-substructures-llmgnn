Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (2, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * We can skip all pairs as they include nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [0].
