Response:
Following the process demonstrated in the example given, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 10) -> Both 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. One triangle formed <0, 10, 0>.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. One triangle formed <1, 2, 1>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. One triangle formed <1, 6, 1>.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. One triangle formed <2, 4, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> Both 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. One triangle formed <2, 10, 2>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 15) -> Both 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. One triangle formed <2, 15, 2>.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. One triangle formed <3, 5, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. One triangle formed <3, 7, 3>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 18) -> Both 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. One triangle formed <3, 18, 3>.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Both 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. One triangle formed <4, 11, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> Both 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. One triangle formed <4, 16, 4>.

The other nodes have smaller numbers than the nodes already processed, so we skip them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 10.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
