Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No edge between 5 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - No edge between 9 and 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No edge between 3 and 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - No edge between 1 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - No edge between 5 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) - No edge between 9 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) - No edge between 9 and 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) - No edge between 1 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) - No edge between 5 and 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) - No edge between 5 and 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
