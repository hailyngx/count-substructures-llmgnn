Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 20) -> 16 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (16, 20) and (20, 0) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (16, 22) -> 16 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 24) -> 16 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (16, 24) and (24, 0) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (20, 22) -> 20 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (20, 22) and (22, 0) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (5, 17) and (17, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 28) -> 5 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (5, 28) and (28, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 28) -> 17 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (17, 28) and (28, 17) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 2 as all neighbors are either smaller or not connected to each other.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 26) -> 3 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (3, 26) and (26, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (3, 15) and (15, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (15, 26) -> 15 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7:
    * Skipped as they have smaller neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as (5, 19) and (19, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 9 through 29:

* Node 9: 1 triangle
* Node 10: 2 triangles
* Node 11: 2 triangles
* Node 12: 1 triangle
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 3 triangles
* Node 15: 1 triangle
* Node 16: 3 triangles
* Node 17: 3 triangles
* Node 18: 1 triangle
* Node 19: 2 triangles
* Node 20: 2 triangles
* Node 21: 1 triangle
* Node 22: 2 triangles
* Node 23: 0 triangles
* Node 24: 2 triangles
* Node 25: 0 triangles
* Node 26: 2 triangles
* Node 27: 2 triangles
* Node 28: 3 triangles
* Node 29: 1 triangle

Summing up the triangles for each node, we get a total of 38 triangles.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [38].
