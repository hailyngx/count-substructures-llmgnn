Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5)

Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 4
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4
    - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 6
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4
    - No pair with 4 as the smallest numbered node to form a triangle

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 4
    - Pair 2: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 3: (0, 5) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 1
    - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 3: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Skip all pairs as every other node is smaller than 7
    - No pair with 7 as the smallest numbered node to form a triangle

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 3
    - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 1
    - Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 4: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
