Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as it has already been processed in Node 0 and 1.

* Node 3:
    * Skipped as it has already been processed in Node 1.

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as it has already been processed in Node 0 and 1.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as it has already been processed in Node 1.

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as it has no pairs that result in a triangle.

* Node 7:
    * Skipped as it has no pairs that result in a triangle.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to the lack of pairs to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [5].
