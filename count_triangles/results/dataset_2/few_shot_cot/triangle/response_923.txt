Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 0

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, we will compute the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node and its connections. 

1. Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

2. Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Nodes 1 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Nodes 1 and 5 are directly connected as (1, 5). No other node is connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> Nodes 2 and 3 are directly connected as (2, 3). No other node is connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> Nodes 2 and 5 are directly connected as (2, 5). No other node is connected to both. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9). No other node is connected to both. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summing up the triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
