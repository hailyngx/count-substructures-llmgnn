Response:
Following the same process as before to count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (26, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
            * Pair 2: (26, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
            * Pair 3: (26, 1) -> No triangle formed.

        * Node 26, Node 27, Node 28, and Node 29:
            * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 2 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 1 (Node 21) + 1 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 16.

        Therefore, there are [16] triangles in the given graph.
