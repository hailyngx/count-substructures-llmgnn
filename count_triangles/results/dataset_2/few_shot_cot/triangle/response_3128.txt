Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 3) -> 13 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (13, 6), but since 13 and 6 are both smaller than 8, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * The only pair we could consider is (10, 0), but since 10 and 0 are both smaller than 10, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (13, 8) -> 13 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (14, 0) -> 14 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
