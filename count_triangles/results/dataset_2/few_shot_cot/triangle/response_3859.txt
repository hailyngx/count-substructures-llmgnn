Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (11, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Already considered when analyzing Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (5, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Due to having fewer than 2 nodes with a greater number, no triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [5].
