Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not connected as (9, 10) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not connected as (9, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not connected as (9, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 5 are also connected as (9, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 11 are also connected as (5, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 11 are also connected as (9, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 11 are also connected as (5, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 13 are not connected as (5, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because they don't have at least two nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [6].
