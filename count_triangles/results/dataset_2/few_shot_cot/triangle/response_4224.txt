Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Node 5 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Node 5 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are already considered in the previous pair. No new triangles formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Node 5 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Node 4 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> Node 2 and Node 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Node 7 and Node 16 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> Node 10 and Node 16 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for the remaining nodes and calculate the total number of triangles at the end.
