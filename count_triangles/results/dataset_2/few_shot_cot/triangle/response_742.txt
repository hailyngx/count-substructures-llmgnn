Response:
Following the same method as the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * Skipped because they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
