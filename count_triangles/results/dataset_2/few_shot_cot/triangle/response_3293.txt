Response:
Following the steps provided in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 0) and (0, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 1) and (1, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 2) and (2, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (0, 4) and (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (2, 5) and (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (0, 6) and (6, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (0, 6) and (6, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
[<0, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 0, 5>, <5, 2, 7>, <6, 0, 1>]

Therefore, there are 7 unique triangles in the given graph.
