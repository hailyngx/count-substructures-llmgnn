Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected (0, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 20) -> 6 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 27) -> 14 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected (1, 27). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 3. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 25) -> 10 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 5. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected (9, 18). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 27) -> 9 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected (9, 27). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 7. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 27) -> 8 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected (8, 27). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 27) -> 9 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected (9, 27). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Remaining nodes do not have enough distinct neighbors to form triangles in this graph.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
