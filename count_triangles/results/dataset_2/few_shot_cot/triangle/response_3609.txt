Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph using the provided information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 3) -> 11 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (16, 13) -> 16 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (15, 9) -> 15 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 0) -> 11 and 0 are connected. Checking common neighbors for triangle completion.
        * Common neighbor between (11, 0) and 3: 3
        * Triangle formed: <0, 3, 11>
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected. Checking common neighbors for triangle completion.
        * Common neighbor between (3, 9) and 11: None
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 5) -> 16 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 10) -> 16 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 13) -> 16 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (17, 4) -> 17 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (15, 8) -> 15 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are connected. Checking common neighbors for triangle completion.
        * Common neighbor between (14, 7) and 3: 3
        * Triangle formed: <3, 7, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (19, 6) -> 19 and 6 are connected. Checking common neighbors for triangle completion.
        * Common neighbor between (19, 6) and 8: None
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (18, 16) -> 18 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 4) -> 19 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least two nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
