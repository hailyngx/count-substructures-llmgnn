Response:
Following the step-by-step approach mentioned in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12)-> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
