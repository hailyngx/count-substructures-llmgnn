Response:
Following the example provided, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> Both 11 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> Both 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 11) and (0, 12) are in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 5) -> Both 11 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> Both 6 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 18) -> Both 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> Both 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> Both 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Both 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 5) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Only connected to Node 8, so no triangles possible.

* Node 4:
    * Only connected to Node 5, so no triangles possible.

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Both 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Remaining nodes (6, 7, 8, 9) do not have triangles with larger-numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

[<0, 11, 12>, <2, 5, 17>]
