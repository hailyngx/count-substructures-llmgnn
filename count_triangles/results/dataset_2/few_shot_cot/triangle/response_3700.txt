Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [6].
