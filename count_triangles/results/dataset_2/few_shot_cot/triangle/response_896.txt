Response:
Applying the same method as in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> Node 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 18) -> Node 11 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 18) -> Node 19 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipping all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skipping all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> Node 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Node 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipping all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skipping all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10 through Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed as each of these nodes has at most one connection to other nodes.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
