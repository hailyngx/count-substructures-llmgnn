Response:
Following the method shown in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

There are many more nodes to go through following the same technique. Let's continue to find all the triangles in the graph.
