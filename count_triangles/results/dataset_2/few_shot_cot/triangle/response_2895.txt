Response:
Following the example approach, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 25) -> 9 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (19, 25) -> 19 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 25) -> 11 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 20) -> 9 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (19, 20) -> 19 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continuing this process for Nodes 5 to 29, we find:
    * Node 5: 2 triangles
    * Node 6: 1 triangle
    * Node 7: 0 triangles
    * Node 8: 1 triangle
    * Node 9: 1 triangle
    * Node 10: 0 triangles
    * Node 11: 0 triangles
    * Node 12: 1 triangle
    * Node 13: 0 triangles
    * Node 14: 0 triangles
    * Node 15: 2 triangles
    * Node 16: 0 triangles
    * Node 17: 0 triangles
    * Node 18: 1 triangle
    * Node 19: 2 triangles
    * Node 20: 1 triangle
    * Node 21: 1 triangle
    * Node 22: 2 triangles
    * Node 23: 1 triangle
    * Node 24: 0 triangles
    * Node 25: 0 triangles
    * Node 26: 1 triangle
    * Node 27: 0 triangles
    * Node 28: 1 triangle
    * Node 29: 0 triangles

Summing the total triangles for each node: 
Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0
Total triangles in the graph = 18

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
