Response:
Following the steps outlined in the previous example, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 3) -> 14 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * Already covered in the calculations for nodes smaller than them. 

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Already covered in the calculations for nodes smaller than them. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
