Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 5, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 1, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 4: (6, 1) -> Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 1, 6>.
    * Pair 5: (6, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 5, 6>.
    * Pair 6: (6, 0) -> Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 6, 5>.
    * Pair 7: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 1, 5>.
    * Pair 8: (1, 7) -> Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 1, 7>.
    * Pair 9: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 10: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 11: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 12: (7, 3) -> Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 3, 7>.
    * Pair 13: (7, 2) -> Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 2, 7>.
    * Pair 14: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 11

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> Forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 6, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> Forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 6, 2>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> Forms a triangle with node 1: <0, 1, 6>.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 3, 7>.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 3, 8>.
    * Pair 7: (7, 2) -> Forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 7, 2>.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 7, 8>.
    * Pair 9: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 2, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 8

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 2: <2, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> Forms a triangle with node 2: <2, 4, 3>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 2: <2, 5, 8>.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 2: <2, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

List of unique triangles: <0, 5, 6>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 3>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [24].
