Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not a triangle with 0 because 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Not a triangle with 0 because 5 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> Not a triangle with 0 because 5 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> Not a triangle with 0 because 9 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Not a triangle with 1 because 9 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> Not a triangle with 1 because 9 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> Not a triangle with 1 because 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 4: (9, 0) -> Not a triangle with 1 because 9 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected as there is no edge (1, 6). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Not a triangle with 3 because 9 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Not a triangle with 3 because 9 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> Not a triangle with 3 because 9 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Not a triangle with 4 because 5 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Not a triangle with 4 because 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Not a triangle with 5 because 9 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Not a triangle with 5 because 9 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> Not a triangle with 5 because 9 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5.
    * Pair 4: (6, 4) -> Not a triangle with 5 because 6 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Not a triangle with 6 because 5 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Not a triangle with 6 because 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Not a triangle with 6 because 5 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
