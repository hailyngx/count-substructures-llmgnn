Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 21) -> 1 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 25) -> 1 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (21, 25) -> 21 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (21, 4) -> 21 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (25, 4) -> 25 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (3, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (6, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2: 
    * Proceed as Node 1 and Node 0 are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continue this process for Nodes 3 to 29...

After calculating the total number of triangles formed by each node, the final answer would be the sum of triangles from all nodes. 

Please proceed with this method to find the total number of triangles in the given graph and provide the final answer inside brackets [].
