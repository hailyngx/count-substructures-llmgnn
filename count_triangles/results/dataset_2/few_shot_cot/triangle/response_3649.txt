Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (11, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 17) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (4, 16) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (5, 11) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (5, 15) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and onward:
    * Skipped due to not meeting the criteria of having at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
