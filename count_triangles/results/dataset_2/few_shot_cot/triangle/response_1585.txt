Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the initial example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 1) -> Node 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (7, 1) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Node 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (9, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> Node 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (9, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Node 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (9, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Node 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> Node 4 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Node 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Now, let's continue for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 5, 9, 3.
    * No other nodes to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
