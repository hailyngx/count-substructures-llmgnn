Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 25) - Both 7 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 25) - Both 8 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 25) - Both 5 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (29, 28) - 29 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (29, 8) - 29 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs with nodes smaller than 2 are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 2: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 24) - Both 4 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) - Both 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (24, 16) - Both 24 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pairs with nodes smaller than 4 are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) - 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 28) - 10 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) - 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pairs with nodes smaller than 7 are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 29) - 1 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 28) - 1 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 26) - 1 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (29, 26) - 29 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 23) - 4 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (5, 26) - 5 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 15) - 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 15) - 26 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10: 1

Other nodes will not form any triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
