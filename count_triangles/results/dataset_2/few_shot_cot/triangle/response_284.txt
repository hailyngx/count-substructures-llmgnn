Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Both 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 7 and 10 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 13.
    - Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and 0 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 14.
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [3].
