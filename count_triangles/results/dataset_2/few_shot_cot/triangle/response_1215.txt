Response:
Following the method used in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 2>.
    * Pair 6: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 13: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 16: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 17: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 18: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 19: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 20: (4, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 21: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 22: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 23: (7, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 24: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 ( <0, 2, 5> and <0, 5, 2>).

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 ( <0, 2, 5>).

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as each of these nodes does not have at least 2 other nodes greater in value to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
