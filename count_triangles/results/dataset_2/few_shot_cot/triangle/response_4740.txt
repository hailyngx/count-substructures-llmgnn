Response:
Let's apply the method described in the example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5)  -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13)  -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 0)  -> 8 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12)  -> 8 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 10 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 10 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 10 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The pair (13, 8) is the only option, but since 13 and 8 both have smaller node numbers than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, and 10 are skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
