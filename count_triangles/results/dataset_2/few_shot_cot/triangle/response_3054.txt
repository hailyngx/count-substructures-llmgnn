Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are connected, and 5 and 0 are also connected through node 12. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 8
* The unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 12>, <7, 8, 12>, <9, 10, 16>, <9, 10, 19>
* Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
