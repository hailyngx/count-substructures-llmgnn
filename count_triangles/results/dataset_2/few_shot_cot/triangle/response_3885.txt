Response:
Proceeding node by node to find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 6 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (13, 1) -> 13 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it's smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 8, 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 10, 8, 6 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 14, 12, 13 as they are smaller than 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
