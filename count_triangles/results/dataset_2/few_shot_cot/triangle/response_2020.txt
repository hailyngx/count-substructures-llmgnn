        Continue this process for Nodes 10 through 29.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 3 (Node 12) + ... (continue for the remaining nodes).
        * Total triangles in the entire graph = [Sum of all individual triangles from each node]

        Let's now calculate the total number of triangles in the entire graph.
