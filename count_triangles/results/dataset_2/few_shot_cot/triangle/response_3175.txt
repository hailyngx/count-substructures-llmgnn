    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 18:
    - Since Node 18 is not connected to any other nodes, it cannot form triangles.

Node 19:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) - Not a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (sum of all the triangles formed by individual nodes)
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
