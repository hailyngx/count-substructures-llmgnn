Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected (2, 5). Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected (4, 5). Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected (1, 5). Triangle formed: <1, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected (1, 9). Triangle formed: <1, 2, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected (2, 8). Triangle formed: <2, 8, 0>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected (7, 9). Triangle formed: <3, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller nodes than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller nodes than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller nodes than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller nodes than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller nodes than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Therefore, counting all the triangles found for each node, the answer is:
[<0, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 8, 0>, <3, 7, 9>]
