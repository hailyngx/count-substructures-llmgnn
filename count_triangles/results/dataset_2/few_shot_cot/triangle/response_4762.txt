Response:
Following the step-by-step process, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip Pair 1: (2, 4) as it involves smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip Pair (1, 3) as it involves smaller numbered nodes.
    * Skip Pair (1, 9) as it involves smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip Pair (4, 8) as it involves smaller numbered nodes.
    * Skip Pair (4, 9) as it involves smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 4 to 14, and then sum up the total number of triangles:

Final Answer: [Total number of triangles in the given graph]
