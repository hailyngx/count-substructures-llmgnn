Response:
Following the operation as shown in the example provided, these are the results:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with node 1 (7) and node 5 (5) because they are all connected to node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> Forms a triangle with node 1 (1) and node 3 (5) because they are all connected to node 0.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Forms a triangle with node 3 (3) and node 1 (5) because they are all connected to node 0.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> Forms a triangle with node 1 (1) and node 5 (7) because they are all connected to node 0.
    * Pair 5: (7, 3) -> Forms a triangle with node 3 (3) and node 1 (7) because they are all connected to node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Forms a triangle with node 3 (3) and node 0 (5) because they are all connected to node 1.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Forms a triangle with node 2 (2) and node 4 (5) because they are all connected to node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Forms a triangle with node 4 (4) and node 8 (9) because they are all connected to node 2.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 8 (8) and node 5 (9) because they are all connected to node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, or 3, as they are all smaller than Node 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, as they are all smaller than Node 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, as they are all smaller than Node 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, as they are all smaller than Node 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, as they are all smaller than Node 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, as they are all smaller than Node 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total triangles in the given graph: 
Total triangles = 5 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
