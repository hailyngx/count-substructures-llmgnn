Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Not connected
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Not connected
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Not connected
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Connected as (4, 0) and (0, 7)
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Connected as (1, 2) and (1, 4)
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Connected as (1, 8) and (8, 2)
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Connected as (1, 4) and (4, 3)
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Connected as (2, 6) and (2, 8)
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Connected as (2, 6) and (6, 9)
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Connected as (8, 9) and (9, 6)
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Not connected
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Not connected
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not connected
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Connected as (7, 8) and (8, 3)
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> Connected as (7, 9) and (9, 6)
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Connected as (8, 9) and (9, 6)
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Connected as (4, 0) and (0, 7)
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Connected as (1, 7) and (7, 0)
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Connected as (1, 8) and (8, 2)
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as there are no other nodes higher than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Connected as (9, 7) and (7, 0)
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Connected as (9, 8) and (8, 2)
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Connected as (0, 9) and (9, 6)
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Connected as (1, 8) and (8, 3)
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Connected as (1, 9) and (9, 6)
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> Connected as (3, 8) and (8, 2)
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Connected as (8, 9) and (0, 9)
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as there are no other nodes higher than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 4 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 20.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
