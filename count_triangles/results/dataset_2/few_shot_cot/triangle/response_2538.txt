Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (18, 23) - Both 18 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 29) - Both 18 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (23, 29) - Both 23 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles with node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangles with node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangles with node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangles with node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles with node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 20:
    * No possible triangles with node 20 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 21:
    * No possible triangles with node 21 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 22:
    * No possible triangles with node 22 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 23:
    * No possible triangles with node 23 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 24:
    * No possible triangles with node 24 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 25:
    * No possible triangles with node 25 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 26:
    * No possible triangles with node 26 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 27:
    * No possible triangles with node 27 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 28:
    * No possible triangles with node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 29:
    * No possible triangles with node 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2)... + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
