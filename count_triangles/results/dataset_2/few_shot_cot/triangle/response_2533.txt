Response:
Following the method described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 5 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 triangles in the given graph.
