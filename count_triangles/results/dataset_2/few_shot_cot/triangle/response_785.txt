Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 8, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Triangle formed: <1, 7, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> Triangle formed: <0, 3, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Triangle formed: <6, 10, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Triangle formed: <7, 9, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Triangle formed: <8, 10, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Triangle formed: <9, 11, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Triangle formed: <10, 14, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * No triangles found with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed: <7, 9, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Triangle formed: <1, 7, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * No triangles found with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:  
[<0, 8, 14>, <1, 7, 12>, <1, 2, 13>, <0, 3, 12>, <6, 10, 11>, <7, 9, 12>, <8, 10, 14>, <9, 11, 7>, <10, 14, 0>, <1, 7, 13>]  

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph.
