Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
