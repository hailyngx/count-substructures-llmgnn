Response:
Following the process outlined in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 27) -> Triangle formed with node 6.
    * Pair 2: (21, 27) -> Triangle formed with node 21.
    * Pair 3: (21, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 24) -> Triangle formed with node 7.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 27) -> Triangle formed with node 6.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (24, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 4 to 29:

* Node 4: 1 triangle
* Node 5: 1 triangle
* Node 6: 1 triangle
* Node 7: 1 triangle
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 1 triangle
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 1 triangle
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 1 triangle
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 1 triangle
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 0 triangles
* Node 22: 0 triangles
* Node 23: 0 triangles
* Node 24: 1 triangle
* Node 25: 1 triangle
* Node 26: 2 triangles
* Node 27: 1 triangle
* Node 28: 0 triangles
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Calculating the total: 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 15

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
