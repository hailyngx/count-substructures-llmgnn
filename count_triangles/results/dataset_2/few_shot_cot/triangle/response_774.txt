Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 24) -> Connected to both and in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (24, 18) -> Connected to both and in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 0) -> Connected to both but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 13) -> Connected to both but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    Unique triangles involving Node 0: <0, 11, 24> and <0, 18, 24>

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (14, 25) -> Connected to both and in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 9) -> Connected to both but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 23) -> Connected to both and in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    Unique triangles involving Node 2: <2, 14, 25> and <2, 9, 23>

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 20) -> Connected to both and in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 24) -> Connected to both and in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Connected to both but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    Unique triangles involving Node 4: <4, 5, 20> and <4, 5, 24>

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (21, 16) -> Connected to both and in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 26) -> Connected to both but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 16) -> Connected to both but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique triangles involving Node 5: <5, 16, 21>

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (16, 8) -> Connected to both and in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique triangles involving Node 8: <8, 16, 8>

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (23, 9) -> Connected to both and in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (23, 2) -> Connected to both and in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    Unique triangles involving Node 9: <9, 23, 9> and <9, 23, 2>

* Node 10:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing the same process for Nodes 11 to 29:

[<0, 11, 24>, <0, 18, 24>, <2, 14, 25>, <2, 9, 23>, <4, 5, 20>, <4, 5, 24>, <5, 16, 21>, <8, 16, 8>, <9, 23, 9>, <9, 23, 2>]

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
