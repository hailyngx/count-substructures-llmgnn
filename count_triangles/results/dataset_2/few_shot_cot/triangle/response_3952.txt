Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 23) -> 2 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list (0, 23, 2).
    * Pair 2: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (23, 19) -> 23 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list (0, 23, 19).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list (4, 16, 1).
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 24) -> 4 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list (4, 24, 1).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (23, 24) -> 23 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list (23, 24, 2).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Continuing this process for other nodes:
    * Node 3: 0 triangles
    * Node 4: 1 triangle
    * Node 5: 0 triangles
    * Node 6: 0 triangles
    * Node 7: 0 triangles
    * Node 8: 0 triangles
    * Node 9: 0 triangles
    * Node 10: 1 triangle
    * Node 11: 0 triangles
    * Node 12: 1 triangle
    * Node 13: 0 triangles
    * Node 14: 0 triangles
    * Node 15: 1 triangle
    * Node 16: 2 triangles
    * Node 17: 0 triangles
    * Node 18: 1 triangle
    * Node 19: 2 triangles
    * Node 20: 0 triangles
    * Node 21: 0 triangles
    * Node 22: 0 triangles
    * Node 23: 1 triangle
    * Node 24: 1 triangle
    * Node 25: 0 triangles
    * Node 26: 0 triangles
    * Node 27: 1 triangle
    * Node 28: 0 triangles
    * Node 29: 0 triangles

Calculating the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles found for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 13

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph. Reiterating, the final count of triangles in the graph is [13].
