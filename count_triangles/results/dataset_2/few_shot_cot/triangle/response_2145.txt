Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it's smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 3) -> 13 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles: 0

Summing all the triangles from each node: [1 (Node 0) + 0 + 1 (Node 2) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0] = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 0, 6>, <2, 3, 4>]
