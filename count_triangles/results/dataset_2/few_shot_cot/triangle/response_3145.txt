Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:

    (Calculations for Node 1 skipped as the pairs involving Node 0 are already calculated.)

* Node 2 through Node 19:
    (Pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 have already been covered, so these nodes will be assessed accordingly.)

    * Node 2:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 3:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 4:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 5:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 6:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 7:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 8:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 9:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 10:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 11:
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 12:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 13:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 14:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 15:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 16:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 17:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 18:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

    * Node 19:
        * Pairs: [] (No triangles)

Summarizing the triangles:
0 triangles found in the graph.

Therefore, the answer is [0].
