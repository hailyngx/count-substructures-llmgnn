Response:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To find the number of triangles, we will follow the same step-by-step process as shown in the example. Let's start by counting the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it is not connected to any other nodes.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (25, 26) -> 25 and 26 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (25, 5) -> 25 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (25, 8) -> 25 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (26, 8) -> 26 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (22, 23) -> 22 and 23 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 14) -> 22 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (23, 14) -> 23 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, and so on until Node 30.

After counting the triangles for each node and summing them up, we will have the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed with the calculations.
