Response:
Following the step-by-step process given in the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (11, 3) -> 11 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (10, 0) -> 10 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No triangle formed.

* Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No triangle formed.

* Node 11:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No triangle formed.

* Node 12:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No triangle formed.

* Node 13:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No triangle formed.

* Node 14:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = **1**

Therefore, there is **1 triangle** in the given graph.

The unique triangle found is: [<0, 5, 8>].
