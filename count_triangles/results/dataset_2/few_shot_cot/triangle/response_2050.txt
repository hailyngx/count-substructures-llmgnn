Response:
Following the provided graph details, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph by examining each node for possible triangles. 

Let's start the process:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) - 1 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 10) - 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 10) - 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) - 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) - 2 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 13) - 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 13>.
    * Pair 5: (3, 10) - 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) - 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) - 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 11>.
    * Pair 4: (8, 13) - 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <2, 8, 13>.
    * Pair 5: (8, 12) - 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 4) - 10 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (10, 8) - 10 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) - 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <3, 11, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * There are no possible triangles with Node 4.

Continuing this process for all nodes, we will then sum up the total number of triangles found in the graph. Let's continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to find all triangles in the graph.
