Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the previous example, we will determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Form a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> Form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (17, 20) -> 17 and 20 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) -> Form a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (14, 17) -> Form a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 21) -> Form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 25) -> Form a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (15, 20) -> Form a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> Form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (14, 26) -> Form a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (16, 23) -> 16 and 23 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 27) -> Form a triangle with Node 10.
    * Pair 2: (10, 15) -> Form a triangle with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles found so far:
- Nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 each contribute 1 triangle.
- Nodes 1, 2, and 10 each contribute 2 triangles.
- Nodes 3 and 9 do not contribute to any triangles yet.

Continuing with the remaining nodes to find more triangles.
