Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected because (1, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 0 are also connected as (3, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 0 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Only one pair to consider: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 3 are directly connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 6 are also connected as (9, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 9 and 0 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 0 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs with larger nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
