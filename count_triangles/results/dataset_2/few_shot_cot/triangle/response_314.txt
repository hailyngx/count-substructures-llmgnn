Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with all smaller nodes.

* Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with all smaller nodes.

* Node 11:
    - Skip any pairs with all smaller nodes.

* Node 12:
    - Skip any pairs with all smaller nodes.

* Node 13:
    - Skip any pairs with all smaller nodes.

* Node 14:
    - Skip any pairs with all smaller nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
