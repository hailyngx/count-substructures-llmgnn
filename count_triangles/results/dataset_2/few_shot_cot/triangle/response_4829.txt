Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
