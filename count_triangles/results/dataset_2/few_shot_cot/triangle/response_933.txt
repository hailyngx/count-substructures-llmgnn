Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4)

Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1  (<0, 4, 6>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1  (<0, 1, 4>)

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1  (<3, 4, 7>)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1  (<6, 7, 9>)

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1  (<4, 8, 3>)

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
