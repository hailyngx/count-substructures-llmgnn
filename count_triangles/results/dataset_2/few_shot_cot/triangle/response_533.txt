Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by analyzing the triangles formed by each node:

* Node 0:
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        * <3, 15, 17>

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        * <5, 18, 16>

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) = 2.
Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
