Response:
Following the same steps as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 18) -> 0 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
