Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 10) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 10>.
    * Pair 8: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (2, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (9, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 1.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 2.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 3.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 5.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 6.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (13, 6), but since 13 is smaller, this pair is skipped.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 8.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 9.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 10.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 11.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 12.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 13.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 14.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
[Hence, the total number of triangles in this graph is [1].]
