Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> Both 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected as (0, 4) and (0, 17) from the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> Both 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are connected as (1, 3) and (1, 14) from the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 15) -> Both 12 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are connected as (1, 12) and (1, 15) from the edge list. Triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
