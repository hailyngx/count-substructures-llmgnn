Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's identify the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> (5, 0, 10) forms a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (5, 15) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 10) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 15) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 10) -> (7, 0, 10) forms a triangle.
    * Pair 9: (7, 15) -> (7, 0, 15) forms a triangle.
    * Pair 10: (10, 15) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> (8, 1, 10) forms a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> (4, 3, 19) forms a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
   * These nodes either have no triangles or have all their triangles accounted for when considering smaller nodes. Thus, no more triangles are found when considering them as the starting node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
