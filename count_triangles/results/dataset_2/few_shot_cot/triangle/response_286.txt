Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, here is the breakdown of counting triangles for each node in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 4:
        * Due to size constraints in the available list of nodes, all pairs involving Node 4 are skipped for counting triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 17.

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [17].
