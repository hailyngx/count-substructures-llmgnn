Response:
Following the same step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 (3, 6, 4).
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> Node 10 is not a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> Node 11 is not a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 1) -> Node 1 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0, but there is no direct edge between 1 and 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 10) -> Node 6 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0, but there is no direct edge between 6 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 11) -> Node 6 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0, but there is no direct edge between 6 and 11. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 (6, 1, 4).
    * Pair 8: (10, 11) -> Nodes 10 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (10, 1) -> Node 10 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0, but there is no direct edge between 1 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (11, 1) -> Node 11 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0, but there is no direct edge between 1 and 11. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skipped all pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipped all pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 (5, 7, 8).
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Node 12 is not a 1-hop neighbor of Node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 (5, 0, 6).
    * Pair 4: (6, 12) -> Node 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but there is no direct edge between 6 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 (6, 0, 4).
    * Pair 6: (12, 0) -> Node 12 is not a 1-hop neighbor of Node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3
* Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

    * Node 4:
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 6:
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 10:
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 11:
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 12:
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 13:
        * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 14:
        * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
