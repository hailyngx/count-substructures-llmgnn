Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Form a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) - Form a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Form a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - Form a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 4: (7, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip the only pair with Node 0 as it's smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
