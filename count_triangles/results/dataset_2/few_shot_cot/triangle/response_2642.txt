Response:
Following the step-by-step triangle counting method for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip the pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 since they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip the pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 since they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip the pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 since they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip the pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 since they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip the pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 since they are smaller than 7.

    * Skip the pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 since they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip the pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 since they are smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Skip the pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 since they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip the pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 since they are smaller than 12.

* Node 13:
    * Skip the pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 since they are smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip the pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13 since they are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
