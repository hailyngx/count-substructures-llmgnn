Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected as (0, 7), forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are connected as (6, 19), forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are connected as (6, 0), forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Only connected to itself, therefore no triangles can be formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are connected as (2, 12), forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (2, 20) -> 2 and 20 are connected as (2, 20), forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are connected as (3, 13), forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are connected as (3, 15), forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 25) -> 4 and 25 are connected as (4, 25), forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 24) -> 5 and 24 are connected as (5, 24), forming a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are connected as (6, 19), forming a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (6, 29) -> 6 and 29 are connected as (6, 29), forming a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 22) -> 7 and 22 are connected as (7, 22), forming a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 27) -> 8 and 27 are connected as (8, 27), forming a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (8, 29) -> 8 and 29 are connected as (8, 29), forming a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 20) -> 9 and 20 are connected as (9, 20), forming a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are connected as (10, 12), forming a triangle with Node 10.
    * Pair 2: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are connected as (10, 18), forming a triangle with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are connected as (11, 13), forming a triangle with Node 11.
    * Pair 2: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are connected as (11, 17), forming a triangle with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for all nodes, we find the total number of triangles in the graph: 

[<0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 19>, <0, 6, 0>, <2, 2, 12>, <2, 2, 20>, <3, 3, 13>, <3, 3, 15>, <4, 4, 25>, <5, 5, 24>, <6, 6, 19>, <6, 6, 29>, <7, 7, 22>, <8, 8, 27>, <8, 8, 29>, <9, 9, 20>, <10, 10, 12>, <10, 10, 18>, <11, 11, 13>, <11, 11, 17>] 

Therefore, there are 19 triangles in the given graph.
