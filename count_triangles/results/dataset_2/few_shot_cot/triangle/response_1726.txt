Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1**:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2**:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Once all nodes have been processed, count the total number of triangles found and output them inside brackets [] and list the unique triangles found inside <> such as <0, 2, 4>.
