Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph by following the same step-by-step method as in the example:

* Node 0: 
  * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are connected as (2, 0) and (0, 5).
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly.
  * Pair 2: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 4) and (1, 15).
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (1, 3) and (1, 14).
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (4, 5) and (4, 15).
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (1, 6) and (6, 8).
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 as it is smaller than 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it is smaller than 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
  * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as (10, 13) and (10, 14).
  * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 as it is smaller than 11.
  * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
  * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected as (12, 17) and (12, 19).
  * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 as it is smaller than 13.
  * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 3 and 4 and 8 as they are smaller than 14.
  * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 15.
  * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 and 8 as they are smaller than 16.
  * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 12 as they are smaller than 17.
  * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18 and Node 19:
  * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 18 or 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
