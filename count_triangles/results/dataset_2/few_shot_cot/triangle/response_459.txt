Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 11 are also connected as (5, 11) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 11 are also connected as (7, 11) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 13 are also connected as (3, 13) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 10 and 12 are also connected as (10, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 10 and 12 are also connected as (10, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * There are no pairs for Node 8 because no two 1-hop neighbors are connected to form a triangle.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9 and 3 and 7 are directly connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 12 and 6 are also connected as (12, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and 5 and 13 are also connected as (5, 13) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and 14 and 6 are also connected as (14, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * There are no pairs for Node 13 because no two 1-hop neighbors are connected to form a triangle.

* Node 14:
    * There are no pairs for Node 14 because no two 1-hop neighbors are connected to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
