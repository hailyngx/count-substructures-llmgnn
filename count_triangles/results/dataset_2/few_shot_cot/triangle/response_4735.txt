Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4:**
    - Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. **Node 5:**
    - Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

18. **Node 17:**
    - No pairs to consider as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 17.

19. **Node 18:**
    - No pairs to consider as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 18.

20. **Node 19:**
    - No pairs to consider as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 19.


Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
