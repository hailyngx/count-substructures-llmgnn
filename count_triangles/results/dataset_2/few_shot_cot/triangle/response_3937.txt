Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Both 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8)  -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6)  -> Both 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 8) -> Both 11 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Both 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (7, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2)  -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1)  -> Both 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6)  -> Both 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (13, 14). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 10) -> Both 13 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (13, 10). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10)  -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to find the total number of triangles in the graph.

After calculating for all nodes:

* Total triangles in the graph = Sum of triangles for each node
* Total triangles in the graph = [4]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
