Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the previous example, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) - 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle <0, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 3) - 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (6, 3) - 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle <1, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) - 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (7, 6) - 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (9, 6) - 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) - 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle <2, 4, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle <2, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) - 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle <2, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 5: (3, 0) - 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle <2, 3, 0>.
    * Pair 6: (6, 0) - 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) - 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle <3, 4, 0>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) - 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (8, 0) - 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
