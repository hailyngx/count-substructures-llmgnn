Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided and applying it to each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 29) -> 10 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 25) -> 12 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 29) -> 12 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 12 and 18 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (15, 29) -> 15 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 15 and 29 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (20, 26) -> 20 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (20, 16) -> 20 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 13) -> 20 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (20, 23) -> 20 and 23 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (16, 28) -> 16 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 13) -> 16 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 16 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (16, 23) -> 16 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 16 and 23 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 24) -> 7 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 24 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* For Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipping these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, and then summing up the total triangles formed:

[<2, 15, 29>, <4, 16, 13>, <4, 16, 23>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 24>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
