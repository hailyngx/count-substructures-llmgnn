Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

[<7, 0, 15>, <7, 11, 0>, <6, 13, 19>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <7, 9, 15>]
