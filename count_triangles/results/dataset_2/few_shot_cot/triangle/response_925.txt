Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node in the graph provided, we can find the total number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) - Both 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) - Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) - Both 10 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) - Both 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) - Both 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) - Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) - Both 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 2 are directly connected as (8, 2) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) - Both 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 7) - Both 11 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) - Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 12 are directly connected as (5, 12) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) - Both 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 10 and 14 are directly connected as (10, 14) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14: 
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
