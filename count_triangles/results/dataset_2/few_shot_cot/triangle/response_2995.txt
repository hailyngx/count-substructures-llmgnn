Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no direct edge between them.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 3) -> Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Both 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> Both 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> Both 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> Both 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> Both 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
