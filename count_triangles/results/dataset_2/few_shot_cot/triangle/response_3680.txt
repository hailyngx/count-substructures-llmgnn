Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Considering pairs with nodes greater than 2:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - The only pair we could consider is (9, 14), but since 9 and 14 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2, as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    - Following the same logic, it's found that there are no triangles with any of these nodes as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
