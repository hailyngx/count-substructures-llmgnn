Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Nodes 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected (3, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) - Nodes 0 and 1 are directly connected (0, 1) in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) - Nodes 0 and 3 are directly connected (0, 3) in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 6) - Nodes 0 and 6 are directly connected (0, 6), and they are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 7) - Nodes 0 and 7 are directly connected (0, 7) in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) - Nodes 1 and 8 are directly connected (1, 8) in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - Nodes 1 and 5 are directly connected (1, 5) in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) - Nodes 1 and 14 are directly connected (1, 14), and they are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) - Nodes 1 and 2 are directly connected (1, 2) in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) - Nodes 2 and 9 are directly connected (2, 9) in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) - Nodes 2 and 10 are directly connected (2, 10) in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) - Nodes 3 and 13 are directly connected (3, 13) in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - Nodes 3 and 6 are directly connected (3, 6) in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) - Nodes 3 and 12 are directly connected (3, 12), but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 0) - Nodes 3 and 0 are directly connected (3, 0) in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) - Nodes 3 and 9 are directly connected (3, 9), and they are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  - Please continue this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, listing the pairs and counting the triangles.

Finally, sum up all the counted triangles for each node to find the total number of triangles in the given graph. []
