    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * No more unique nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * No more unique nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
