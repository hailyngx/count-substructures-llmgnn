Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <4, 6, 11>, <4, 7, 12>, <4, 18, 15>, <14, 19, 9>, and <17, 5, 13>.

Thus, the final answer is [6].
