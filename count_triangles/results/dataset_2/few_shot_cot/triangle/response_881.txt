Following the same methodology as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are also connected as (2, 11).
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are also connected as (0, 2).
    * Pair 3: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are also connected as (0, 12).
    * Pair 4: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are also connected as (4, 12).

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the final answer is [18].
