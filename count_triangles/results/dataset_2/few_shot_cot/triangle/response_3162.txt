    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
