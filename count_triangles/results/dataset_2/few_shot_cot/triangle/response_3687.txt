Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, I will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (12, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (12, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (0, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (15, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (5, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (0, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (13, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. Node 14:

    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

16. Node 15:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

17. Node 16:
    - Pair 1: (11, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

18. Node 17:
    - Pair 1: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

19. Node 18:
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

20. Node 19:
    - Pair 1: (4, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
