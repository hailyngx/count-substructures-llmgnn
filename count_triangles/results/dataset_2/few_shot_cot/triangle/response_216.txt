Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 18) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 18 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (10, 18) -> No triangle formed since 10 and 18 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (10, 9) -> No triangle formed since 10 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (18, 9) -> No triangle formed since 18 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (18, 5) -> No triangle formed since 18 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (18, 19) -> No triangle formed since 18 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 19) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 0) -> No triangle formed since 1 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed since 1 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed since 1 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed since 1 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (0, 6) -> No triangle formed since 0 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (0, 4) -> No triangle formed since 0 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed since 0 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed since 6 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed since 6 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> No triangle formed since 16 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> No triangle formed since 1 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 17) -> No triangle formed since 2 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 17) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> No triangle formed since 8 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> No triangle formed since 13 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 9) -> No triangle formed since 11 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> No triangle formed since 16 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node since its neighbors are greater than itself.

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Since each of these nodes has fewer than 2 nodes greater than itself, no triangles can be formed with them as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
