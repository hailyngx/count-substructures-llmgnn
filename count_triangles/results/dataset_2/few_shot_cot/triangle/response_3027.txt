Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Node 2 and Node 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Node 2 and Node 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Node 2 and Node 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> Node 2 and Node 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> Node 3 and Node 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> Node 3 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (3, 6) -> Node 3 and Node 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> Node 4 and Node 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Node 5 and Node 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Node 5 and Node 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Node 7 and Node 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and Node 9 are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Node 4 and Node 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and Node 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Node 6 and Node 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Node 6 and Node 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Node 8 and Node 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
