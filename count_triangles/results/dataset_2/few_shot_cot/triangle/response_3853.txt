Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined earlier, we will now determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 15 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are not connected because (15, 18) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 12) -> 15 and 12 are not connected because (15, 12) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> Both 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 10 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> Both 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 19 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to be considered as there are no 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> Both 6 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.

    * No other pairs with substantial nodes left to form triangles with Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Finally, summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 2 (Node 16) + 2 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 13.

Therefore, there are a total of 13 triangles in the given graph [13].
