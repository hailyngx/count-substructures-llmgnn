Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> No triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> No triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 4: (15, 13) -> No triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> No triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) -> No triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> No triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> No triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 3: (12, 6) -> No triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> No triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> No triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 3: (19, 14) -> No triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 8) -> No triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 2: (10, 15) -> No triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 3: (8, 15) -> No triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 3: (13, 7) -> No triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 2) -> No triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> No triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 3: (0, 11) -> No triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> No triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> No triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 3: (17, 3) -> No triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 (and all other nodes up to 19):
    * These nodes will not form triangles as they do not have at least 2 connected nodes with higher numbers.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8-19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
