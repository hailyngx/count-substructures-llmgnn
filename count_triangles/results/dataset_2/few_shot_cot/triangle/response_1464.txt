Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the same method used in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - Connected as (2, 8). No other 1-hop neighbor pair forms a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Connected as (5, 8). No other 1-hop neighbor pair forms a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Connected as (3, 9). No other 1-hop neighbor pair forms a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
