Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - No triangles as it has only one neighbor.

- Node 1:
    - <1, 19, 6> (1, 19), (1, 6), (19, 6)
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - <2, 29, 14> (2, 29), (2, 14), (29, 14)
    - <2, 16, 24> (2, 16), (2, 24), (16, 24)
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - <3, 5, 9> (3, 5), (3, 9), (5, 9)
    - No other triangles with Node 3.

    - <8, 3, 17> (8, 3), (8, 17), (3, 17)
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 9:
    - <9, 5, 22> (9, 5), (9, 22), (5, 22)
    - No other triangles with Node 9.

    - <16, 2, 24> (16, 2), (16, 24), (2, 24)
    - No other triangles with Node 16.

- Node 17:
    - <17, 3, 7> (17, 3), (17, 7), (3, 7)
    - No other triangles with Node 17.

- Node 18:
    - No triangles as it has fewer than 2 neighbors.

- Node 19:

    - No other triangles with Node 24.

- Node 25:
    - No triangles as it has fewer than 2 neighbors.

- Node 26:
    - No triangles as it has fewer than 2 neighbors.

- Node 27:
    - No triangles as it has fewer than 2 neighbors.

- Node 28:
    - No triangles as it has fewer than 2 neighbors.

- Node 29:
    - <29, 2, 14> (29, 2), (29, 14), (2, 14)
    - No other triangles with Node 29.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 14) + 2 (Node 15) + 2 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 24) + 1 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 21) + 12 triangles that involve nodes not listed above = 25

Therefore, the final answer is: [25].
