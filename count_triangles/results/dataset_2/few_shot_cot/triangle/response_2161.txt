Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (16, 4) -> 16 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are one-hop neighbors and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (<7, 2, 6>, <7, 2, 13>, <12, 2, 6>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<6, 3, 12>)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<13, 4, 16>)

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<11, 15, 9>, <11, 17, 9>)

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with any of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
