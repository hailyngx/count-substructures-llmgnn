Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Node 2 is 1-hop neighbor of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (0, 5) -> Node 5 is 1-hop neighbor of Node 0, and they are connected as (0, 5). 
  - Pair 4: (0, 11) -> Node 11 is 1-hop neighbor of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (0, 12) -> Node 12 is 1-hop neighbor of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Node 4 is 1-hop neighbor of Node 1, and they are connected as (1, 4). 
  - Pair 2: (1, 0) -> No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
  - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Node 6 is 1-hop neighbor of Node 2, and they are connected as (2, 6).
  - Pair 2: (2, 11) -> Node 11 is 1-hop neighbor of Node 2, and they are connected as (2, 11).
  - Pair 3: (2, 0) -> Node 0 is 1-hop neighbor of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (2, 14) -> Node 14 is 1-hop neighbor of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (2, 5) -> Node 5 is 1-hop neighbor of Node 2, and they are connected as (2, 5).
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, we find:
- Node 3: 0 triangles
- Node 4: 0 triangles
- Node 5: 2 triangles
- Node 6: 0 triangles
- Node 7: 0 triangles
- Node 8: 2 triangles
- Node 9: 0 triangles
- Node 10: 2 triangles
- Node 11: 0 triangles
- Node 12: 0 triangles
- Node 13: 2 triangles
- Node 14: 0 triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is the sum of triangles found for each node:
Total triangles = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10.

Hence, the final answer is [10].
