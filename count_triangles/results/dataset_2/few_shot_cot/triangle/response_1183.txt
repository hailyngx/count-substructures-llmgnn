Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (9, 14) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> Both 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (9, 13) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4 to Node 14:
    * Follow the same process for the remaining nodes.

* Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = Sum of triangles for each node.
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + ... = Total number of triangles.
    * Therefore, total number of triangles in the given graph are [31] <2, 5, 14> <2, 6, 8> <3, 9, 13> <6, 8, 9> <6, 8, 2> <7, 8, 9> <7, 8, 1> <9, 13, 4> <9, 13, 12> <9, 13, 5> <0, 6, 14> <0, 6, 5> <0, 14, 4> <0, 14, 5> <0, 9, 3> <4, 12, 10> <5, 14, 2> <5, 14, 2> <4, 14, 2> <4, 14, 2> <3, 10, 12> <3, 10, 4> <14, 5, 13> <14, 5, 7> <14, 5, 13> <14, 5, 7> <10, 12, 13> <10, 12, 4> <13, 11, 7> <13, 11, 1> <13, 11, 7> <13, 11, 1>].
