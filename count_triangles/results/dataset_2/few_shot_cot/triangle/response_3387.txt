    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) = 14.

    Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.

    Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
