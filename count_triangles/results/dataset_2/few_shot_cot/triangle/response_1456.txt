Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 0) -> 12 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (0, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (12, 9) -> 12 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (12, 9) -> 12 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (12, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 0) -> 12 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (0, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 5: 0 triangles
* Node 6: 1 triangle
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 1 triangle
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 2 triangles

Summing up the total number of triangles formed by each node:

[Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) = 8]

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 12>, <0, 2, 12>, <1, 0, 12>, <2, 12, 13>, <2, 0, 12>, <6, 3, 11>, <6, 10, 11>, <12, 9, 7>
