Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected because (5, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are connected as (5, 2) in the edge list, but 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected because (6, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected as (3, 8) in the edge list, but 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list, and 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list, but 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

The final answer is: [0].
