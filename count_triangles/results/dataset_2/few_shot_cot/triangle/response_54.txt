Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 3) -> 10 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 10 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (10, 5) -> 10 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 10 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 13 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13:
    * Skip because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than any of these nodes.

* Node 14:
    * Skip because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than 14.

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes with smaller numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) = 6.  

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.  

Thus, the final answer is [6].
