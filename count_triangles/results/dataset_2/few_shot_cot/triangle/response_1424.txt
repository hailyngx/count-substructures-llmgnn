Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs because nodes smaller than 5 are already considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Due to the lack of at least two nodes greater than each of these nodes, no triangles can be formed with any of them as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph: [<0, 3, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <4, 2, 7>]. 
The final answer is [3].
