Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected, and 6 is connected to 0. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected to 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are connected to 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected to 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected to 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected to 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected to 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are connected to 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Since Node 0 and Node 1 are smaller, we skip any pairs with them.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected to 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected to 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected to 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pairs are formed only with nodes 6 and 8 which are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Since the remaining nodes have lower numbers, we exclude them.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * These nodes only have pairs with smaller nodes, so no triangles can be formed with them.

Summarizing the triangles:
**Total triangles in the graph:** 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is **1 triangle** in the given graph.

Output: [1]
