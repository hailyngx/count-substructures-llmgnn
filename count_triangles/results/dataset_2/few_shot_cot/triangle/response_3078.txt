Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue the process for Nodes 2 to 19 accordingly to find the total number of triangles in the graph. When you reach the end, please provide the final answer inside brackets [].
