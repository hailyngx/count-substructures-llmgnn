Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided with the graph information given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 12 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 14 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
Continuing this process for Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<7, 12, 0>, <7, 14, 0>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 14>, <2, 9, 11>, <2, 9, 14>, <4, 6, 10>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 13, 7>

The final answer is [9].
