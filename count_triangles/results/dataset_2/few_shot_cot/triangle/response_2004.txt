Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) - Triangle formed: <0, 7, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) - Triangle formed: <1, 9, 7>
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - Triangle formed: <1, 5, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Triangle formed: <2, 6, 9>
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) - Triangle formed: <2, 3, 7>
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Triangle formed: <3, 6, 9>
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) - Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) - Triangle formed: <3, 5, 1>
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) - Triangle formed: <3, 7, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Triangle formed: <4, 9, 7>
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Triangle formed: <4, 8, 2>
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - Triangle formed: <4, 5, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Triangle formed: <5, 6, 3>
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) - Triangle formed: <5, 1, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Triangle formed: <6, 9, 4>
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) - Triangle formed: <6, 5, 3>
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) - Triangle formed: <6, 3, 7>
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) - Triangle formed: <6, 2, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Triangle formed: <7, 9, 1>
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) - Triangle formed: <7, 8, 4>
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) - Triangle formed: <7, 0, 2>
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) - Triangle formed: <7, 3, 6>
    * Pair 5: (7, 1) - Triangle formed: <7, 1, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) - Triangle formed: <8, 4, 9>
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) - Triangle formed: <8, 2, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - Triangle formed: <9, 4, 8>
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) - Triangle formed: <9, 1, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2
   
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 4 (Node 6) + 5 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 29.

Therefore, there are [29 triangles] in the given graph.
