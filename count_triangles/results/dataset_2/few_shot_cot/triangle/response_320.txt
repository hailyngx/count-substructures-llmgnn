Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. Hence, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2:  (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:

    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
