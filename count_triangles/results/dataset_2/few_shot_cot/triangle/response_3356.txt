* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 20) -> 15 and 20 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 4) -> 15 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (15, 5) -> 15 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (15, 6) -> 15 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (20, 4) -> 20 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.

    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (14, 20) -> 14 and 20 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 22) -> 14 and 22 are not connected. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 24) -> 17 and 24 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 24) -> 19 and 24 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 28) -> 9 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 28) -> 15 and 28 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continue this process similarly for Nodes 10 to 29.

After completing the above process for all nodes, we sum up the total number of triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
