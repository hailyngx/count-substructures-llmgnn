Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 29) -> 8 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (27, 20) -> 27 and 20 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (19, 13) -> Both 19 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 3) and (7, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (15, 24) -> Both 15 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (3, 5) and (7, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skipping repeating combinations with smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (9, 6) and (17, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No additional pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip 0 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (23, 28) -> 23 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipping repeating combinations with smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (6, 9) and (19, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes...

Finally, summing up the total number of triangles formed by each node:

[Total number of triangles in the graph: 5]

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
