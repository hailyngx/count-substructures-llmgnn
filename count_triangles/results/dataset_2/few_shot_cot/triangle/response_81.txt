Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided and considering each node individually to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> Connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 14) -> Connected.
    * Pair 5: (8, 11) -> Connected.
    * Pair 6: (14, 11) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> Connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> Connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 12) -> Connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 12) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> Connected.
    * Pair 4: (10, 13) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (7, 14) -> Connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 11) -> Connected.
    * Pair 6: (14, 11) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
[5 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 4 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 21]

Therefore, there are 21 triangles in the given graph.
