Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the sample, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 12) -> Connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (14, 3) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 7: (14, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 8: (14, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 9: (14, 2) -> Connected indirectly via Node 2.
    * Pair 10: (3, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 11: (3, 12) -> Connected.
    * Pair 12: (3, 2) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 13: (11, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 14: (11, 2) -> Connected indirectly via Node 2.
    * Pair 15: (12, 2) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 5) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (13, 2) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (13, 12) -> Connected.
    * Pair 7: (13, 1) -> Connected via Node 1.
    * Pair 8: (2, 12) -> Connected.
    * Pair 9: (2, 5) -> Connected.
    * Pair 10: (12, 5) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (14, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (14, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (14, 2) -> Connected indirectly via Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (11, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (11, 2) -> Connected.
    * Pair 6: (12, 5) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3, Node 4, Node 5:
    * Skipping these nodes as they are smaller than the previous ones, no triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 4) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) -> Connected.
    * Pair 5: (11, 4) -> Connected.
    * Pair 6: (11, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 7: (4, 10) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, and Node 13:
    * Skipped as they are smaller than the previous ones, no triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
