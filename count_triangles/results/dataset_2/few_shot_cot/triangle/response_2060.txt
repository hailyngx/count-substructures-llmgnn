Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 6 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 8 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
