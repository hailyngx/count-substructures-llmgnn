Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph using the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> Both 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> Both 15 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 6) -> Both 15 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 6) -> Both 17 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
