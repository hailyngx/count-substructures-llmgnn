Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> 14, and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are connected, but 8 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of each other. However, 8 and 2 are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12, and 14 are connected, and 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of each other. There is also an edge between them (12, 14) forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13, 18 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 16) -> 0 and 16 are connected, and 0 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors. However, no direct edge between 0 and 16. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3, 11 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
