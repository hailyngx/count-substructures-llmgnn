Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) - Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) - Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 13) - Node 0 and Node 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - Node 1 and Node 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - Node 2 and Node 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Node 3 and Node 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - Node 3 and Node 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) - Node 3 and Node 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.

    * Pair 3: (4, 2) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) - Node 5 and Node 11 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) - Node 5 and Node 1 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) - Node 6 and Node 11 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) - Node 6 and Node 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) - Node 6 and Node 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 1) - Node 6 and Node 1 are directly connected. Triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - Node 9 and Node 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) - Node 11 and Node 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 4 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.
