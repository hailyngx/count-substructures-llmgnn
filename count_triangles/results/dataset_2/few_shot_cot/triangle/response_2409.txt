Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Skip because 6 is larger than 2.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Skip because 8 is larger than 2.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> Skip because 4 is larger than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with nodes larger than 3. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with nodes larger than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs including nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs including nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with nodes larger than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
