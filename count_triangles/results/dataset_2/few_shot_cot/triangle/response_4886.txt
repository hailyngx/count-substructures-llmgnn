    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> Already counted in the triangles with Node 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 17) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
