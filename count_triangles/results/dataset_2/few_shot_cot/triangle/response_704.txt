Response:
Following the process outlined in the example step-by-step, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 16: <0, 5, 16>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 17: <1, 6, 17>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 15: <1, 6, 15>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 10: <1, 6, 10>.
    * Pair 4: (17, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17 and Node 15: <1, 17, 15>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13 and Node 17: <2, 13, 17>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 and Node 10: <3, 9, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6 have already been analyzed.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10 and Node 12: <7, 10, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 13: <2, 8, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 3: <5, 9, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 2: <11, 5, 2>.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 and Node 17: <12, 7, 17>.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 do not form any triangles with at least two other nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11.

Therefore, there are [11 triangles] in the given graph.
