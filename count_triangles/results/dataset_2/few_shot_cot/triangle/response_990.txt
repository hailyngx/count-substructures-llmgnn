Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph according to each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (13, 4) -> 13 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (14, 4) -> 14 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no connection between them in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no connection between them in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no connection between them in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - The pairs with nodes smaller than 8 are not considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14: 
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [7].
