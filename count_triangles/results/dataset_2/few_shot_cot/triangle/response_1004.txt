Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example, let's count the triangles for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Both 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (12, 1) -> Both 12 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected (12, 14, 1) as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Both 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (11, 1) -> Both 11 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected (11, 1, 14) as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (14, 2) -> Both 14 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> Both 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (14, 10) -> Both 14 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected (9, 8, 3) as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> Both 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (13, 5) -> Both 13 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected (13, 5, 4) as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected (8, 14, 5) as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
            * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form a triangle.

        Summing up the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 5.

        Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
