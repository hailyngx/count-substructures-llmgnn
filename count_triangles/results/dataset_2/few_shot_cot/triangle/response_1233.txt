Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 13 are also connected as (1, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (8, 13). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (8, 14). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 14). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 14). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 12 are also connected as (6, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 10 and 13 are also connected as (10, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * All these nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles, so we skip them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
