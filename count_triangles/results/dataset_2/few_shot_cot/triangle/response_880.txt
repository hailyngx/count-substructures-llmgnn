Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> Both 18 and 19 are directly connected to 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 26) -> Both 8 and 26 are directly connected to 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (25, 23) -> 25 and 23 are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (25, 3) -> 25 and 3 are directly connected to 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 20) -> 7 and 20 are directly connected to 3. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are directly connected to 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 5:
    * Continue the process with remaining nodes.
    ...

Now, continue this process for all remaining nodes in the graph and finally output the total number of triangles in the graph within brackets [].
