* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [ <0, 3, 13> ]

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4 to 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.  
\[ <0, 3, 13>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 9, 11>,  <4, 17, 18> \]
