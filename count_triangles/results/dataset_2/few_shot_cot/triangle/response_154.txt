Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 2 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = [13].

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are <15, 11, 1>, <15, 8, 1>, <13, 10, 3>, <17, 16, 6>, <9, 19, 5>, <5, 17, 9>, <17, 0, 6>, <5, 1, 11>, <6, 17, 16>, <5, 9, 19>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 15>, <5, 0, 19>.
