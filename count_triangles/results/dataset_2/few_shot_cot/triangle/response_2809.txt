Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 0.
    - No triangles with Node 0.

2. **Node 1:**
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    - No triangles with Node 1.

3. **Node 2:**
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    - No triangles with Node 2.

4. **Node 3:**
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    - No triangles with Node 3.

5. **Node 4:**
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    - No triangles with Node 4.

6. **Node 5:**
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    - No triangles with Node 5.

7. **Node 6:**
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    - No triangles with Node 6.

8. **Node 7:**
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    - No triangles with Node 7.

9. **Node 8:**
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    - No triangles with Node 8.

10. **Node 9:**
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16.
    - Total triangles with Node 9: 1 (<5, 14, 16>).

11. **Node 10:**
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    - No triangles with Node 10.

12. **Node 11:**
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    - No triangles with Node 11.

13. **Node 12:**
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    - No triangles with Node 12.

14. **Node 13:**
    - Pair 1: (14, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15.

15. **Node 14:**
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    - Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 19.
    - Total triangles with Node 14: 2 (<9, 6, 3>, <9, 1, 19>).

16. **Node 15:**
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 15.

    - Total triangles with Node 16: 1 (<9, 1, 19>).

18. **Node 17:**
    - No pairs to consider for forming triangles.

19. **Node 18:**
    - No pairs to consider for forming triangles.

20. **Node 19:**
    - No pairs to consider for forming triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 16) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
