Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 11) -> 12 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * All nodes have at least two nodes greater than them for potential triangle formation. Going through the pairs for each node:
    * Node 6: Total triangles = 2
        * <6, 7, 1>
        * <6, 2, 1>
    * Node 7: Total triangles = 0
    * Node 8: Total triangles = 0
    * Node 9: Total triangles = 16
        * <9, 10, 3>, <9, 10, 4>, <9, 10, 13>, <9, 12, 1>, <9, 12, 3>, <9, 12, 7>, <9, 12, 14>, <9, 3, 10>, <9, 3, 4>, <9, 3, 7>, <9, 4, 10>, <9, 4, 14>, <9, 7, 12>, <9, 7, 14>, <9, 10, 14>, <9, 13, 14>
    * Node 10: Total triangles = 2
        * <10, 13, 4>
        * <10, 13, 14>
    * Node 11: Total triangles = 0
    * Node 12: Total triangles = 0
    * Node 13: Total triangles = 2
        * <13, 4, 14>
        * <13, 10, 4>
    * Node 14: Total triangles = 4
        * <14, 2, 6>
        * <14, 2, 7>
        * <14, 7, 6>
        * <14, 13, 4>

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 16 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 4 (Node 14) = 28.

Therefore, there are 28 triangles in the given graph.
