Response:
Applying the same step-by-step process as shown in the example to count the triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Triangle formed with nodes 1, 5, and 0. Triangle <0, 1, 5>.
            * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are connected and Node 0 is also connected to them. Triangle formed including nodes 0, 5, and 6. Triangle <0, 5, 6>.
            * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> Nodes 5 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed with nodes 4, 5, and 0. Triangle <0, 4, 5>.
            * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed with nodes 0, 5, and 7. Triangle <0, 5, 7>.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with nodes 1, 5, and 9. Triangle <1, 5, 9>.
            * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Triangle formed with nodes 0, 5, and 1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>.
            * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Nodes 5 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed with nodes 1, 5, and 7. Triangle <1, 5, 7>.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with nodes 4, 7, and 2. Triangle <2, 4, 7>.
            * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with nodes 4, 8, and 2. Triangle <2, 4, 8>.
            * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> Triangle formed with nodes 0, 4, and 2. Triangle <0, 2, 4>.
            * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed with nodes 7, 8, and 2. Triangle <2, 7, 8>.
            * Pair 6: (7, 0) -> Triangle formed with nodes 0, 7, and 2. Triangle <0, 2, 7>.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

        * Node 3:
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2, which are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed with nodes 7, 8, and 4. Triangle <4, 7, 8>.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5 to avoid repetition.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
            * Skipped as they cannot form at least 2 nodes greater than them to create triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

        Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
