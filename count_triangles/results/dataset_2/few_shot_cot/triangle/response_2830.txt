Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 20) -> 10 and 20 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (19, 20) -> 19 and 20 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than the other nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (2, 20) -> 2 and 20 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (17, 23) -> 17 and 23 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (23, 27) -> 23 and 27 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6 to 12:
    * Skipped because they are not part of any triangle formation.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 21) -> 7 and 21 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (18, 21) -> 18 and 21 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Pair 1: (18, 26) -> 18 and 26 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15 to Node 28:
    * Skipped because they are not part of any triangle formation.

* Node 29:
    * Pair 1: (19, 27) -> 19 and 27 are connected as shown in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 29.
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 29) = 10.
