Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) - Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as seen in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) - Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as seen in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 3: (4, 2) - Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected as seen in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 1) - Both 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.

    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9 as they are smaller numbered.
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) - Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) - Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected as seen in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) - Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9 as they are smaller numbered.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are connected as seen in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are connected as seen in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, and they are connected as seen in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. [9]
