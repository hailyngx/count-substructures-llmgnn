Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 12>.
    * Pair 4: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 12, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 12>.
    * Pair 5: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 12>.
    * Pair 4: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <3, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Let's continue this process for the remaining nodes: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
