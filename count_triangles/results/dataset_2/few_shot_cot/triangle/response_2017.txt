Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 28) - Both 12 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 24) - Both 12 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (24, 28) - Both 24 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (16, 26) - Both 16 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 20) - Both 16 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 25) - Both 3 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) - Both 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 25) - Both 11 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) - Both 5 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's continue this process for Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Finally, we will sum up the total number of triangles found and output the answer. Let's continue the calculations.
