Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * No more pairs are left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * No more pairs are left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * No more pairs are left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * No more pairs are left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
