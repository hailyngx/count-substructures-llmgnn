Response:
This is a detailed way to count triangles in a graph by examining each node one by one:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (7, 13) in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 13) in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected because (4, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected because (4, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (7, 13) in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (8, 13) in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (1, 13) in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * The edge list does not contain triangles starting with Node 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (9, 6, 7) in the edge list forming a triangle.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * The edge list does not contain triangles starting with Node 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (1, 13) in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Pair 1: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (12, 10) in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 10:
            * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as (11, 13) in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Nodes 11 through 14:
            * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 4.

        Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
