Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
