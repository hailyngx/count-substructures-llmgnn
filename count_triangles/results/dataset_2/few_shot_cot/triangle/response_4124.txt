Response:
Following the same method as shown in the previous example, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph by analyzing each node's connections:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed. <0, 4, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed. <1, 4, 13>
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed. <1, 7, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed. <2, 4, 3>
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed. <3, 9, 13>
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected. Triangle formed. <8, 5, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected. Triangle formed. <9, 1, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also connected. Triangle formed. <10, 5, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes greater than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes greater than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes greater than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

[<0, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 7, 14>, <2, 4, 3>, <3, 9, 13>, <8, 5, 14>, <9, 1, 14>]
