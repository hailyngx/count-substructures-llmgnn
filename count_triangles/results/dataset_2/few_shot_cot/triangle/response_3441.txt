Response:
Following the step-by-step process demonstrated in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are skipped  due to small hop neighbors or no other nodes to form triangles with.
  
* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 1) -> 13 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Skip all pairs where the other node is smaller than 11. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 13 and 14 are skipped due to small hop neighbors or no other nodes to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
