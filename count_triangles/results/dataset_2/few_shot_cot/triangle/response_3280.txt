Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided details for the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) - 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Only connected to Node 9 with no other nodes larger than 1. No triangles possible.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (3, 18) - 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 19) - 3 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) - 4 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) - 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 19) - 18 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) - 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) - 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 17) - 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 13) - 8 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 14) - 8 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 17) - 8 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Pair 8: (13, 14) - 13 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (13, 17) - 13 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (14, 17) - 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

We will now proceed to find the triangles for Nodes 6 to 19 following the same approach. Let's continue with Node 6.
