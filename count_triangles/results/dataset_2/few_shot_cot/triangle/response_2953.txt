Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> Connected through edge (1, 2), triangle formed <1, 3, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Connected through edge (1, 4), triangle formed <1, 3, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Connected through edge (2, 3) and (2, 4), triangle formed <2, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Connected through edge (3, 4) and (3, 5), triangle formed <3, 4, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs to form triangles for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs to form triangles for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No more pairs to form triangles for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, the answer is [4].
