Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example, we will now go through each node in the graph to count the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 6) in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (18, 6) -> 18 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * No triangle can be formed by Node 1 as it has only 1 neighbor.

* Node 2:
  * No triangle can be formed by Node 2 as it has only 1 neighbor.

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 18) in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (13, 4) -> 13 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (18, 4) -> 18 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 18) in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 14) in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 12) in the edge list.
  * No other pairs can form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
  * No triangle can be formed by Node 5 as it has only 2 neighbors.

* Node 6:
  * No additional triangles can be formed by Node 6 beyond those already counted for other nodes.

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (17, 10) -> 17 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (17, 10) in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (17, 0) -> 17 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  * No other pairs can form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
  * No triangle can be formed by Node 8 as it has only 2 neighbors.

* Node 9:
  * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected as (8, 12) is not in the edge list.
  * No other pairs can form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
  * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as (12, 16) in the edge list.
  * No other pairs can form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
  * No additional triangles can be formed by Node 11 beyond those already counted for other nodes.

* Node 12:
  * No additional triangles can be formed by Node 12 beyond those already counted for other nodes.

* Node 13:
  * No additional triangles can be formed by Node 13 beyond those already counted for other nodes.

* Node 14:
  * No additional triangles can be formed by Node 14 beyond those already counted for other nodes.

* Node 15:
  * No additional triangles can be formed by Node 15 beyond those already counted for other nodes.

* Node 16:
  * No additional triangles can be formed by Node 16 beyond those already counted for other nodes.

* Node 17:
  * No additional triangles can be formed by Node 17 beyond those already counted for other nodes.

* Node 18:
  * No additional triangles can be formed by Node 18 beyond those already counted for other nodes.

* Node 19:
  * No additional triangles can be formed by Node 19 beyond those already counted for other nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 10) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [6].
