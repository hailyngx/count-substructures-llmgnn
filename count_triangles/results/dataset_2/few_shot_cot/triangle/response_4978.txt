Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph considering each node as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9> 
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> There is no edge between 5 and 4, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 14>
    * Pair 4: (5, 11) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 11>
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> There is no edge between 9 and 4, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 14) -> There is no edge between 9 and 14, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 11) -> There is no edge between 9 and 11, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 14>
    * Pair 9: (4, 11) -> There is no edge between 4 and 11, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (14, 11) -> Triangle formed: <0, 14, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pairs involving node 0, 5, 9: Skipped as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed: <1, 6, 8>
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> Triangle formed: <1, 6, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving nodes smaller than 2: Skipped 
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> There is no edge between 8 and 10, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs involving nodes smaller than 3: Skipped
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 7>
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> There is no edge between 4 and 13, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 12>
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) -> There is no edge between 7 and 13, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 12) -> There is no edge between 7 and 12, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 13) -> Triangle formed: <3, 12, 13>
    * Pair 7: (13, 10) -> Triangle formed: <3, 10, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6:
    * Following the similar process, we find:
    * Node 4: 1 triangle
    * Node 5: 2 triangles
    * Node 6: 2 triangles

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 8) -> There is no edge between 13 and 8, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipping them as there are no suitable larger numbered nodes to form triangles with.

Adding up the triangles from each node:
Total triangles = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 15

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
