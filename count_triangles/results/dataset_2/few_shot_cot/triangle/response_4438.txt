Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 6, and node 2

Response:
Let's break down the process of counting triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 0, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs having smaller nodes than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs having smaller nodes than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs having smaller nodes than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs having smaller nodes than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there are no nodes greater than 8 or 9.
    

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

So, [2].
