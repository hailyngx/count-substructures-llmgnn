Response:
Following the process outlined in the example given, let's count the triangles in the graph using each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Not a triangle because 1 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Not a triangle because 1 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Not a triangle because 4 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Not a triangle because 0 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 24) -> Not a triangle because 9 and 24 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (23, 27) -> Not a triangle because 23 and 27 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 20) -> Not a triangle because 13 and 20 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> Not a triangle because 0 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (10, 27) -> Not a triangle because 10 and 27 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for nodes 10 to 29 will provide the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's continue with Node 10.
