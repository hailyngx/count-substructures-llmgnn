Response:
Following the step-by-step instructions provided in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Node 0 is connected to nodes 12 and 13. Nodes 12 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Nodes 1, 3, and 15 are interconnected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (12, 14) -> Nodes 2, 12, and 14 are interconnected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (1, 12) -> Nodes 1, 6, and 12 are interconnected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (11, 18) -> Nodes 8, 11, and 18 are interconnected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (13, 15) -> Nodes 9, 13, and 15 are interconnected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    - Pair 1: (5, 18) -> Nodes 5, 14, and 18 are interconnected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are: 
[<0, 12, 13>, <1, 3, 15>, <2, 12, 14>, <6, 12, 1>, <8, 11, 18>, <9, 13, 15>, <11, 15, 17>, <14, 18, 5>].
