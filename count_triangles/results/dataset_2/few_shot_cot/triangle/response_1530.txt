Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 0 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
