Summarizing the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 3 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<6, 1, 10>, <4, 12, 13>, <1, 7, 11>, <7, 3, 14>, <2, 3, 12>, <2, 4, 13>, <10, 13, 6>, <11, 4, 7>, <4, 11, 1>, <3, 4, 14>, <2, 13, 4>, <1, 10, 6>, <3, 8, 12>.
