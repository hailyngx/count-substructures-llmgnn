Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example given, we will count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Connected through node 4. Triangle formed. <0, 4, 14>
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Connected through node 4. Triangle formed. <0, 4, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Connected through node 8 and 14. Triangle formed. <1, 8, 14>
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 5) -> Connected through node 10 and 5. Triangle formed. <3, 10, 5>
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Connected through node 8 and 14. Triangle formed. <4, 8, 14>
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Connected through node 10 and 14. Triangle formed. <6, 10, 14>
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 14>, <0, 4, 1>, <1, 8, 14>, <3, 10, 5>, <4, 8, 14>, <6, 10, 14>.

The final answer is [6].
