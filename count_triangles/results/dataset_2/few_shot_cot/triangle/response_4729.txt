Response:
Following the same process as in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Nodes 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> Nodes 1 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 17) -> Nodes 1 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> Nodes 1 and 5 are directly connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 5) -> Nodes 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 12) -> Nodes 2 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 17) -> Nodes 2 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 12) -> Nodes 5 and 12 are directly connected as (5, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than 1.
    * No more pairs to analyze for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than 2.
    * No more pairs to analyze for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than 3.
    * No more pairs to analyze for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No connected nodes to create a triangle.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than 5.
    * No more pairs to analyze for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No connected nodes to create a triangle.

* Node 7:
    * No connected nodes to create a triangle.

* Node 8:
    * No connected nodes to create a triangle.

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than 9.
    * No more pairs to analyze for Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No connected nodes to create a triangle.

* Node 11:
    * No connected nodes to create a triangle.

* Node 12:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than 12.
    * No more pairs to analyze for Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than 13.
    * No more pairs to analyze for Node 13.

* Node 16:
    * No connected nodes to create a triangle.

* Node 17:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than 17.
    * No more pairs to analyze for Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than 18.
    * No more pairs to analyze for Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes than 19.
