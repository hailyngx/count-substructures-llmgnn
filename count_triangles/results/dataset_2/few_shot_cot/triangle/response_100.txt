Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Skipped as 1 and 2 are smaller nodes than 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) - 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are connected (1, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) - 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are connected (1, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) - 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 8) - 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are connected (8, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skipped all pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No more pairs left to check. Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipped all pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No more pairs left to check. Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skipped all pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * No more pairs left to check. Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped all pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs left to check. Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipped all pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs left to check. Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipped all pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipped all pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No more pairs left to check. Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipped all pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No more pairs left to check. Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped all pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * No more pairs left to check. Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
