Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * There aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 8.
