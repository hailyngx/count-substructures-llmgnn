Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 10) -> Both 12 and 10 are connected through node 0. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 1>.
    * Pair 7: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Continue to check pairs with larger nodes only.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 2, 3, and 4:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Continuing the process for the remaining nodes:

* Total triangles in the graph: [1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1)] = [3].

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
