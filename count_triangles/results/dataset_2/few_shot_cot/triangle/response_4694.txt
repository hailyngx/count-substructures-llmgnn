Response:
Following the same method as the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (8, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (15, 21) -> 15 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 24) -> 4 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes to form triangles. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5-29:
    * Skipped because they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
