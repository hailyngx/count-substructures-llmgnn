Response:
Let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12 as they are smaller than 13.
    - Pair 1: (17, 1) -> 17 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 13 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 15-20:
    - Skipped because they are not connected to any other nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
