Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0)

Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4 because they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 because they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7 and Node 8:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7 or 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 because it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
