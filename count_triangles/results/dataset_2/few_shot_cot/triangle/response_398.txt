Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (19, 28) -> Nodes 19 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 12) -> Nodes 19 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 12) -> Nodes 28 and 12 are directly connected. No additional triangles with Node 0 as the smallest node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 23) -> Directly connected. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> Directly connected. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> Directly connected. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 4: (23, 5) -> Directly connected. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 5: (23, 10) -> Directly connected. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 6: (5, 10) -> Nodes 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Only considering pairs with larger nodes.
    * Pair 1: (14, 28) -> Directly connected. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) -> Directly connected. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 3: (19, 28) -> Directly connected. Potential triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> Nodes 7 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continuing this process for Nodes 4 through 29 and summing up the triangles formed with each node as the smallest numbered node, we get:
* [12]

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph. We list the unique triangles found inside <> such as <node1, node2, node3> each only once in the answer.
