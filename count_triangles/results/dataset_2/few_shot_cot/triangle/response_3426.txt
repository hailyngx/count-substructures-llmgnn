Response:
Continuing the process as demonstrated in the example provided:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) = 7.

        Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
