Response:
Following the same process as explained before, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are directly connected, but 6 is not a 1-hop neighbor of itself. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are directly connected, but 8 is not a 1-hop neighbor of itself. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are directly connected, but 7 is not a 1-hop neighbor of itself. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are directly connected, but 5 is not a 1-hop neighbor of itself. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
