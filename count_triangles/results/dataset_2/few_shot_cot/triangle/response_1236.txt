Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (0, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No pairs are available to form a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
