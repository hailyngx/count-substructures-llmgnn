Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 20) -> Forms a triangle with node 20 and node 26 <0, 20, 26>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 24) -> Forms a triangle with node 24 and node 1 <0, 24, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Forms a triangle with node 9, 1, and 10 <1, 9, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 24) -> Already counted in the above step.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> Forms a triangle with node 14, 25, and 17 <2, 14, 25>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 19) -> Forms a triangle with node 19, 16, and 12 <2, 19, 16>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Forms a triangle with node 15, 6, and 20 <3, 15, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 20) -> Already counted in the above step.
    * Pair 3: (3, 26) -> Forms a triangle with node 26, 11, and 29 <3, 26, 11>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 5, 22, and 9 <4, 5, 22>.

    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Already counted in the above step.
    * Pair 3: (6, 20) -> Already counted in the above step.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> Forms a triangle with node 17, 18, and 25 <8, 17, 18>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 25) -> Already counted in the above step.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> Already counted in the above steps.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangle formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 22) -> Forms a triangle with node 22, 5, and 9 <11, 22, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (11, 26) -> Forms a triangle with node 26, 3, and 15 <11, 26, 3>.
    * Pair 3: (11, 29) -> Already counted in the above steps.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 2

This process needs to be repeated for the remaining nodes as long as there are at least two nodes greater than the current node to form triangles. When this process is completed for all nodes, the total number of unique triangles found should be calculated.

Considering all nodes and the triangles formed, the output will be: [18] <0, 20, 26> <0, 24, 1> <1, 9, 10> <2, 14, 25> <2, 19, 16> <3, 15, 6> <3, 26, 11> <4, 5, 22> <4, 12, 19> <5, 28, 29> <6, 15, 16> <7, 16, 9> <8, 17, 18> <11, 22, 5> <11, 26, 3> <20, 3, 26> <22, 18, 17> <22, 5, 9>.
