Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges.

* Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been calculated already.
* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 6 are also connected as (0, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 0 and 12 are also connected as (0, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 14 are also connected as (6, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 10 are also connected as (6, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 13 are also connected as (6, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 12 are also connected as (0, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with at least two nodes greater than 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 4 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
