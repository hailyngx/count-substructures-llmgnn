Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided, here are the counts for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are directly connected. Checking for a third node connected to both 2 and 4...
        * Found triangle: <2, 4, 0> (printed only once)
    * Pair 4: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are directly connected. Checking for a third node connected to both 2 and 12...
        * Found triangle: <2, 12, 0> (printed only once)
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected. Checking for a third node connected to both 4 and 5...
        * Found triangle: <4, 5, 0> (printed only once)
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are directly connected. Checking for a third node connected to both 11 and 14...
        * Found triangle: <11, 14, 1> (printed only once)
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are directly connected. Checking for a third node connected to both 5 and 11...
        * Found triangle: <5, 11, 4> (printed only once)
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are directly connected. Checking for a third node connected to both 5 and 14...
        * Found triangle: <5, 14, 4> (printed only once)
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are directly connected. Checking for a third node connected to both 0 and 4...
        * Found triangle: <0, 4, 5> (printed only once)
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6 to 14:
    Nodes 6 to 14 do not have enough nodes greater than them to form triangles, so they will not contribute to the triangle count.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 7

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
