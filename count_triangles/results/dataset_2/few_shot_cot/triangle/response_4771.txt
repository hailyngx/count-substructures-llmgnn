Response:
Following the method described in the example above, let's count the triangles formed with each node as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 11.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 12.
    * Pair 4: (2, 19) -> Node 2 and Node 19 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 11.
    * Pair 6: (8, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 12.
    * Pair 7: (11, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11 and Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) -> Node 5 and Node 16 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 16) -> Node 7 and Node 16 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1. No other pairs for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs available for Node 3 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> Node 7 and Node 16 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 4. No other pairs for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs available for Node 6 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, or 5. No other pairs for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * No pairs available for these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
