Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
