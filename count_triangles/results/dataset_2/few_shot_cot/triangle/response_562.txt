Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles found are:
[<0, 6, 13>, <0, 6, 12>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 9, 13>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 3>, <4, 7, 5>].
