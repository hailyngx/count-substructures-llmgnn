Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - All pairs skipped as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 greater than Node 1 itself.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - All pairs skipped as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 greater than Node 2 itself.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - All pairs skipped as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 5 greater than Node 5 itself.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now continue with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    - All pairs skipped as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 6 greater than Node 6 itself.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - All pairs skipped as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 7 greater than Node 7 itself.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - All pairs skipped as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 8 greater than Node 8 itself.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - All pairs skipped as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 9 greater than Node 9 itself.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
