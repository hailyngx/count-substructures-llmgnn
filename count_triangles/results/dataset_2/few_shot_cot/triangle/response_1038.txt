Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 22) -> Both 3 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 20) -> 9 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 20) -> 11 and 20 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (18, 12) -> 18 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 11) -> 15 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (18, 10) -> 18 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are no triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip as there are no triangles involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No connections to other nodes, so no triangles involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (26, 29) -> 26 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (22, 10) -> 22 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for all remaining nodes:

* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 1 triangle
* Node 16: 1 triangle
* Node 17: 3 triangles
* Node 18: 1 triangle
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 1 triangle
* Node 21: 1 triangle
* Node 22: 0 triangles
* Node 23: 0 triangles
* Node 24: 0 triangles
* Node 25: 2 triangles
* Node 26: 0 triangles
* Node 27: 1 triangle
* Node 28: 0 triangles
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 3 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 20) + 1 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 2 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 1 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 14

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
