Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 27) -> 4 and 27 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are connected. Looking for a triangle...
    * Pair 3: (4, 26) -> 4 and 26 are connected. Triangle <0, 18, 26> formed.
    * Pair 4: (27, 18) -> 27 and 18 are connected. Looking for a triangle...
    * Pair 5: (27, 26) -> 27 and 26 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (18, 26) -> 18 and 26 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.  
    * Pair 6: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (26, 16) -> 26 and 16 are connected. Looking for a triangle...
    * Pair 2: (26, 11) -> 26 and 11 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 24) -> 26 and 24 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 11) -> 16 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (16, 24) -> 16 and 24 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 24) -> 11 and 24 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 25) -> 13 and 25 are connected. Looking for a triangle...
    * Pair 2: (13, 23) -> 13 and 23 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (25, 23) -> 25 and 23 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

* Nodes 10 to 29:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of the remaining nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
