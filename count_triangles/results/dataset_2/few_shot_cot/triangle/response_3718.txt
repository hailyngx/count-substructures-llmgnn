Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed. (1, 8, 14)
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * (No pair to consider with nodes larger than 2)
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed. (0, 3, 11)
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed. (0, 3, 9)
    * Pair 4: (0, 11) -> We have already considered this pair. Skip.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed. (3, 5, 9)
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * (No pair to consider with nodes larger than 4)
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * (No pair to consider with nodes larger than 5)
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * (No pair to consider with nodes larger than 6)
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed. (4, 8, 10)
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 1) -> 13 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * (No pair to consider with nodes larger than 9)
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * (No pair to consider with nodes larger than 10)
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * (No pair to consider with nodes larger than 11)
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * (No pair to consider with nodes larger than 12)
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * (No pair to consider with nodes larger than 13)
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * (No pair to consider with nodes larger than 14)
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [5].
