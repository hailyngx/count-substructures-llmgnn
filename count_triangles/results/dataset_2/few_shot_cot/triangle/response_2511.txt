Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No pairs can be considered for forming triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6 to 14 each do not form any triangles. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6 to 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [7].
