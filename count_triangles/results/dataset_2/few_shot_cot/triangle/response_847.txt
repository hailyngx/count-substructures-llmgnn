Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>.
    * Pair 5: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 13) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 13>.
    * Pair 5: (2, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Triangle formed: <3, 7, 11>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (10, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) -> Triangle formed: <4, 10, 11>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> Triangle formed: <4, 5, 11>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Triangle formed: <7, 10, 11>.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least two higher numbered nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
