Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 27) -> 15 and 27 are not 1-hop neighbors as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (27, 18) -> 27 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:

    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * There are no triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 6 to 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as (2, 7) in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 23) -> 2 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10 to Node 19) + 1 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21 to Node 30) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
