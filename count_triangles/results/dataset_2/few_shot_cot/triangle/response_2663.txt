Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (2, 7) -> Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 0>, <3, 4, 0>, <5, 8, 6>, <5, 9, 6>.
