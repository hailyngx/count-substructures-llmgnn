Response:
Following the step-by-step process for each node to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) - Nodes 10 and 13 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) - Nodes 10 and 14 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) - Nodes 13 and 14 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) - Nodes 2 and 10 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - Nodes 2 and 8 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) - Nodes 8 and 10 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) - Nodes 9 and 13 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) - Nodes 9 and 14 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) - Nodes 13 and 14 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) - Nodes 9 and 11 are connected, but nodes 9 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) - Nodes 9 and 13 are connected, but nodes 9 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) - Nodes 11 and 13 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) - Nodes 7 and 12 are connected, but nodes 7 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) - Nodes 7 and 13 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) - Nodes 12 and 13 are connected, but nodes 12 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) - Nodes 7 and 11 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) - Nodes 7 and 14 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) - Nodes 11 and 14 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) - Nodes 12 and 14 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 11. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as they are smaller than 12. No other nodes left to form triangles.

    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
