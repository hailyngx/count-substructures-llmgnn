Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 14 are also connected as (12, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 29) -> 12 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 29) -> 14 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 25) -> 14 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 25) -> 1 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 25 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 28) -> 2 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 24) -> 2 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 23) -> 4 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 26) -> 4 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

Continuing this process for Node 6 onwards:

* Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * Continue counting the triangles following the same process as above.

After completing the process for all nodes, count the total number of triangles found. Output the final answer inside brackets [].

Let's proceed in this manner to find the total number of triangles in the given graph.
