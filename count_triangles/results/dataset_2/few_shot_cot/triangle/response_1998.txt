    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
