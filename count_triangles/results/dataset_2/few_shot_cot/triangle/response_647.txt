Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8)

Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
