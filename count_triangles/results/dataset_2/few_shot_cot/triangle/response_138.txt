Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Both 3 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 18) -> Both 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (19, 14) -> 19 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 19 and 14 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 3) -> Both 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> Both 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
[<11, 12, 1>, <7, 13, 3>, <19, 14, 8>]
