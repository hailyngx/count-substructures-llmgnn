    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 6. No other nodes connected to 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 7.
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are connected. No other node is connected to both 18 and 19. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 8.
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are connected. No other node is connected to both 10 and 16. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 9.
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped as each of these nodes does not have at least two nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
