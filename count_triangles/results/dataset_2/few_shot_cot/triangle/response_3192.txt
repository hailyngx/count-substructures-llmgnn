Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * No triangles formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9-19) = 10.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
