Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle <0, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> Triangle <0, 4, 3>.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> Triangle <0, 7, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle <1, 5, 9>.
    * No other pairs for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle <3, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Triangle <3, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Triangle <3, 5, 6>.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> Triangle <3, 9, 7>.
    * Pair 5: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle <4, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle <6, 5, 7>.
    * No other pairs for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> Triangle <7, 4, 0>.
    * No other pairs for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Triangle <8, 9, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Triangle <8, 9, 4>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Triangle <8, 4, 7>.
    * No other pairs for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are [14] triangles in the given graph.
