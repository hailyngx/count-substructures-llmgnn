Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Only one node connected, no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Not connected to any other nodes, no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (0, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (1, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * Not enough connected nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
