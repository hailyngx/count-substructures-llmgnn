Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 29) -> 3 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (9, 29) -> 9 and 29 are not connected because (9, 29) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not connected because (9, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (29, 7) -> 29 and 7 are not connected because (29, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (29, 12) -> 29 and 12 are not connected because (29, 12) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not connected because (7, 12) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Isolated node, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 20) -> 4 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 20 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 20) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * ...
    * Continue this step-by-step process for all nodes in the graph.

After applying the process to all nodes in the graph, calculate the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found inside <> each only once in the answer. Return the final answer inside brackets [].
