Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0: No connections, so no triangles possible.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 23) -> 7 and 23 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 26) -> 7 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (23, 26) -> 23 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (23, 2) -> 23 and 2 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node. <1, 2, 23>
    * Pair 6: (26, 2) -> 26 and 2 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 20) -> 3 and 20 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 20) -> 17 and 20 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 2) -> 17 and 2 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (20, 2) -> 20 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pairs 1-5: No triangles can be formed as all connections are with smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continue this process for every node in the graph and sum up the triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node.

After performing these calculations for all nodes, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
