Response:
Following the same method as the previous example to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    - <2, 18, 19> - 2 is connected to 18 and 19, but 18 and 19 are not directly connected.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - <5, 19, 29> - Node 5 is connected to 19 and 29, and 19 and 29 are directly connected.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 10, 13, 14, 15: 
    - No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
