Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, we will now find the total number of triangles in the graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (4, 7) - Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 7.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
  - Pair 1: (5, 9) - Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 9. 
  - Pair 2: (5, 7) - Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 7.
  - Pair 3: (7, 9) - Forms a triangle with Node 7 and Node 9.
  - Pair 4: (6, 7) - Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 7.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

- Node 3:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2 as they are smaller than 4.
  - Pair 1: (7, 8) - Forms a triangle with Node 7 and Node 8.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  - No other nodes left to form triangles.

- Node 6:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
  - No other nodes left to form triangles.

- Node 7:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4 as they are smaller than 7.
  - Pair 1: (9, 8) - Forms a triangle with Node 9 and Node 8.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8, 9:
  - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

Final Answer: [7]
