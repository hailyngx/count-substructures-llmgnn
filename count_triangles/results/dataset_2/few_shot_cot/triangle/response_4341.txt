Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Connected to Node 4 and Node 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Connected to Node 4 and Node 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> Connected to Node 4 and Node 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (4, 13) -> Connected to Node 4 and Node 13, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 13>.
    * Pair 5: (7, 10) -> Connected to Node 7 and Node 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (7, 11) -> Connected to Node 7 and Node 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 7: (7, 13) -> Connected to Node 7 and Node 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 8: (10, 11) -> Connected to Node 10 and Node 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 9: (10, 13) -> Connected to Node 10 and Node 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes (5, 9, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) since they have already been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> Connected to Node 12 and Node 14, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 12, 14>.
    * No more pairs to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Connected to Node 9 and Node 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 9, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> Connected to Node 9 and Node 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> Connected to Node 6 and Node 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3) as they have already been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes (1) as it has already been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes (3) as it has already been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1) as they have already been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes (1) as it has already been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes (1, 3) as they have already been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1) as they have already been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes (8) as it has already been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes (2) as it has already been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes (4) as it has already been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes (1, 2) as they have already been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
