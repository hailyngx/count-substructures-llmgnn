Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Nodes 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Nodes 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Nodes 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Nodes 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Nodes 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> Nodes 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> Nodes 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> Nodes 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 3 to 14.

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 4 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph. 
The list of unique triangles is as follows: 
[<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <7, 8, 2>, <7, 8, 5>, <13, 0, 11>].
