Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph based on each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4
    

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
  

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3


* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2


* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    
* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9, 7, 3, and 8 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
  

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (2, 7), but since 2 and 7 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0


* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
  

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
