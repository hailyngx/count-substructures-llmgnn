Response:
Following the same approach as shown in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 12 are also connected as (7, 0, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 11 are also connected as (4, 11, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 12 are also connected as (4, 3, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs can be considered with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 12 are also connected as (6, 4, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be considered with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

The process then continues similarly for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph =  2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
