Response:
Following the process of counting triangles step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible pairs to consider. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
