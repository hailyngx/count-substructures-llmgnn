Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 25) -> 16 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (14, 25) -> 14 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 20:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 21:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 22:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 23:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 24:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 25:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 26:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 27:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 28:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 29:

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
