Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (7, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (5, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (9, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (7, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as (9, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as (9, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
