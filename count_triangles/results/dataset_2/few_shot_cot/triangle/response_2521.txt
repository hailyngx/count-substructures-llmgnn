Response:
Following the example from before, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both connected to Node 0 but are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both connected to Node 0 but are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are both connected to Node 0 but are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are both connected to Node 1 but are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are both connected to Node 1 but are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are both connected to Node 1 but are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skipping pairs including Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are connected to Node 2 and are directly connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are both connected to Node 2 but are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are both connected to Node 2 but are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Skip pairs including Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are both connected to Node 4 but are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - 5 does not form a triangle with any other nodes through direct connections.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are both connected to Node 6 but are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are directly connected to Node 6 but are not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (19, 15) -> 19 and 15 are directly connected to Node 6 but are not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    - Skipped in the same way as above.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [1].
