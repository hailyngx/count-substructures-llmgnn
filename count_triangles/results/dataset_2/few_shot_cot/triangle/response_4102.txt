Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 3: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are directly connected. 
    * Pair 5: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Proceeding in a similar fashion for Node 1, we find no triangles.

* Node 2:
    * All pairs involving Node 0 and Node 1 are skipped as they are smaller.
    * No triangles are found for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Continuing to find triangles for Node 3 follows the same process.

* Node 4 to Node 27:
    * Repeat the process for each of these nodes.

* Node 28:
    * Since Node 28 is not connected to any other nodes, we skip it.

* Node 29:
    * Calculate triangles for Node 29.

Summarizing the triangles found for each node, we then tally up the total number of triangles across all nodes.

Output the final answer inside brackets [].
