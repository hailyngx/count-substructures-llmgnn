Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (15, 26) -> 15 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (15, 29) -> 15 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (26, 29) -> 26 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    - Pair 1: (12, 25) -> 12 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (5, 29) -> 5 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Continuing this process for Nodes 4 to 29, we find:
    - Node 4: 0 triangles
    - Node 5: 4 triangles
    - Node 6: 0 triangles
    - Node 7: 3 triangles
    - Node 8: 0 triangles
    - Node 9: 0 triangles
    - Node 10: 1 triangle
    - Node 11: 2 triangles
    - Node 12: 1 triangle
    - Node 13: 0 triangles
    - Node 14: 0 triangles
    - Node 15: 2 triangles
    - Node 16: 3 triangles
    - Node 17: 3 triangles
    - Node 18: 2 triangles
    - Node 19: 0 triangles
    - Node 20: 4 triangles
    - Node 21: 4 triangles
    - Node 22: 0 triangles
    - Node 23: 0 triangles
    - Node 24: 2 triangles
    - Node 25: 4 triangles
    - Node 26: 2 triangles
    - Node 27: 2 triangles
    - Node 28: 4 triangles
    - Node 29: 1 triangle

Summing up all the triangles found for each node, we get a total of 45 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [45].
