Response:
Following the steps outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) - 3 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 20) - 14 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 27) - 14 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) - 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 24) - 17 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 13) - 19 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 27) - 9 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) - 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) - 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) - 3 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) - 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for nodes 10 through 29, we can find the total number of triangles in the graph.
