Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Proceeding with finding the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 1), but since 6 and 1 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
