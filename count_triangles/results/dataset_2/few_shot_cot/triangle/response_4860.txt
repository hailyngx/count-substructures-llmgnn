Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Checking the connections of node 13, we find that it is not directly connected to node 12. No triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Checking the connections of node 7, we find that it is not directly connected to node 5. No triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Checking the connections of node 13, we find that it is not directly connected to node 7. No triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Checking the connections of node 9, we find that it is not directly connected to node 6. No triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Checking the connections of node 6, we find that it is not directly connected to node 9. No triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2. 
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Checking the connections of node 5, we find that it is not directly connected to node 6. No triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Checking the connections of node 6, we find that it is not directly connected to node 5. No triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Let's continue this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Checking the connections of node 5, we find that it is not directly connected to node 6. No triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Checking the connections of node 14, we find that it is not directly connected to node 5. No triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7:
    * Similar evaluations lead to no formed triangles for these nodes as well.

* The executions for the other remaining nodes results in no triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14)
* Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
