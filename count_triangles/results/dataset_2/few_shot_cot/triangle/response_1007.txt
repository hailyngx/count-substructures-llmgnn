Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (10, 25) -> 10 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (14, 25) -> 14 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skipping pairs that include smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - No pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skipping pairs that include smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (14, 25) -> 14 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (16, 29) -> 16 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- For nodes 10 to 29, there are no triangles involving these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
