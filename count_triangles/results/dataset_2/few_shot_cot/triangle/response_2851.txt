Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (8, 0) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 4: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 0) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 0) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 0) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:

    * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 0) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 0) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
