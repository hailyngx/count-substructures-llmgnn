Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node, we can find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: Skipped due to no valid pairs with a greater node number.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - Pair 1: Skipped due to no valid pairs with a greater node number.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Pair 1: Skipped due to no valid pairs with a greater node number.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - Pair 1: Skipped due to no valid pairs with a greater node number.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [7].
