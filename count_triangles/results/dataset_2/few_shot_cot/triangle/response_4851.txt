Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 2 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 2 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 8: 2

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 9: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
