Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected through Node 2, and Node 0 is connected to both 2 and 5. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected through Node 12, and Node 0 is connected to both 2 and 6. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are connected. Node 0 is connected to both 2 and 0. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3
            
        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are connected. Node 1 is connected to both 0 and 6. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
            
        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
            * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are connected. Node 2 is connected to both 0 and 5. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are connected. Node 2 is connected to both 0 and 6. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are connected. Node 2 is connected to both 0 and 2. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3
            
        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are connected. Node 3 is connected to both 2 and 11. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected through Node 13, but Node 3 is not connected to Node 13. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected. Node 3 is connected to both 3 and 6. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected. Node 4 is connected to both 7 and 9. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        Nodes 5 through 14 do not form any triangles:

        * Node 5: 0 triangles.
        * Node 6: 1 triangle.
        * Node 7: 1 triangle.
        * Node 8: 0 triangles.
        * Node 9: 0 triangles.
        * Node 10: 0 triangles.
        * Node 11: 1 triangle.
        * Node 12: 0 triangles.
        * Node 13: 0 triangles.
        * Node 14: 1 triangle.

        Summing up the triangles from each node:
        [3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14)] = 13

        Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
