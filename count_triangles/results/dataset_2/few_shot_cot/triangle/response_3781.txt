Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 26) -> 7 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 18 are also connected.  
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 11.
    * No triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 20:
    * No triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 21:
    * No triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 22:
    * No triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 23:
    * No triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 24:
    * No triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 25:
    * No triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 26:
    * No triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 27:
    * No triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 28:
    * No triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 29:
    * No triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Remaining Nodes) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the output with the unique triangles found would be [ <4, 3, 18> ].
