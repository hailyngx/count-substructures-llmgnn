Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> Both 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 to 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11 to 19:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
