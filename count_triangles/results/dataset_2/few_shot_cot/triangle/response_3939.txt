Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 24) -> 0 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 22) -> 0 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 22) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 29) -> 1 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 29) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected as (2, 16) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 27) -> 2 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 25) -> 2 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected as (2, 25) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 24) -> 3 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* For brevity, skipping the detailed explanation, the total triangles for each remaining node are as follows:
    * Node 4: 2
    * Node 5: 1
    * Node 6: 0
    * Node 7: 2
    * Node 8: 3
    * Node 9: 0
    * Node 10: 2
    * Node 11: 0
    * Node 12: 0
    * Node 13: 2
    * Node 14: 1
    * Node 15: 0
    * Node 16: 4
    * Node 17: 1
    * Node 18: 3
    * Node 19: 0
    * Node 20: 0
    * Node 21: 0
    * Node 22: 0
    * Node 23: 3
    * Node 24: 3
    * Node 25: 2
    * Node 26: 0
    * Node 27: 3
    * Node 28: 1
    * Node 29: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 4 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 3 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 3 (Node 23) + 3 (Node 24) + 2 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 3 (Node 27) + 1 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 35

Therefore, there are 35 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the final answer is [35].
