Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 4: (11, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 5: (7, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Triangle found directly at Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Pair 7: (14, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Triangle found directly at Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * There is only one triangle formed at Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No connections to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Triangle found directly at Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Triangle found directly at Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 10.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Triangle found directly at Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Triangle found directly at Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Triangle found directly at Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 13

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
