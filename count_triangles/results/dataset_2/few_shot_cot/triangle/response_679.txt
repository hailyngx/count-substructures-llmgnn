Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) - Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) - Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 8) - Both 11 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) - Both 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 14) - Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) - Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) - Both 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) - Both 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 8) - Both 11 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) - Both 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) - Both 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) - Both 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) - Both 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 8) - Both 11 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) - Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (13, 8) - Both 13 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are:
[<4, 7, 10>, <4, 7, 10>, <6, 9, 14>, <7, 4, 10>, <8, 11, 14>]
