* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 14).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
