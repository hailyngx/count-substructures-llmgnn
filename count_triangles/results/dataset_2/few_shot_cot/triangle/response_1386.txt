Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (11, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (12, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (12, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (0, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (7, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (2, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - No pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    - Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 4.
Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
