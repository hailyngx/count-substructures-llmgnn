Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 7) and (0, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (10, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Several possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node, but those involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 10) and (10, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 7) and (7, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (8, 10) and (10, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 3) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (10, 7) -> 10 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (10, 7) and (7, 10) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles with Node 4 as all the adjacent nodes are greater.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles with Node 5 as all the adjacent nodes are greater.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles with Node 6 as all the adjacent nodes are greater.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles with Node 7 as all the adjacent nodes are greater.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles with Node 8 as all the adjacent nodes are greater.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles with Node 9 as all the adjacent nodes are greater.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles with Node 10 as all the adjacent nodes are greater.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles with Node 11 as the only adjacent node is greater.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles with Node 12 as all the adjacent nodes are greater.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles with Node 13 as all the adjacent nodes are greater.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles with Node 14 as the only adjacent node is greater.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
