Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    - <0, 4, 9> [Triangle formed with nodes 4 and 9]
    - <0, 7, 9> [Triangle formed with nodes 7 and 9]
    - <0, 1, 7> [Triangle formed with nodes 1 and 7]
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - <1, 2, 4> [Triangle formed with nodes 2 and 4]
    - <1, 4, 7> [Triangle formed with nodes 4 and 7]
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - <2, 4, 9> [Triangle formed with nodes 4 and 9]
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - <3, 5, 6> [Triangle formed with nodes 5 and 6]
    - <3, 7, 9> [Triangle formed with nodes 7 and 9]
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No new triangles can be formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No new triangles can be formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No new triangles can be formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - <7, 9, 0> [Triangle formed with nodes 9 and 0]
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
