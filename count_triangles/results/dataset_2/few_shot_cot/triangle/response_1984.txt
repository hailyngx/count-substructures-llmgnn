Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 25) -> 10 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as there aren't two nodes greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as there aren't two nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (16, 27) -> 16 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 16 and 27 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 23) -> 9 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 26) -> 4 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 21) -> 6 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 29:
    * Skipping these nodes as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
[<3, 16, 27>, <4, 26, 27>, <6, 21, 25>] 

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <3, 16, 27>, <4, 26, 27>, <6, 21, 25>.
