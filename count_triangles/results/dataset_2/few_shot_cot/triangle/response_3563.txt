Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 1 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7, 8, and 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

        Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
