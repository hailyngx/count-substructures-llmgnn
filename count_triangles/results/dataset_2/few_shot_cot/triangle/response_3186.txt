Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 15) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 20) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 23) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 15) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 20) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (14, 23) -> 14 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (14, 23) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (21, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 17) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 24) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (20, 21) -> 20 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (20, 21) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 23) -> 9 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (9, 23) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 24) -> 11 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (11, 24) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (16, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Remaining Nodes:
    * Nodes 8, 10, 12, and 26 do not form triangles with any larger numbered nodes or do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them.
    * Nodes 18, 19, 27, and 28's pairs involve nodes smaller than them, hence no triangles.
    * Nodes 9, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, and 29 are covered in earlier calculations.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
