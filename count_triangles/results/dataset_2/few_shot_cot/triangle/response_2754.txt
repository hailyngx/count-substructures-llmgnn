Response:
Following the method shown in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skipping Node 0 as it has no 2-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Nodes 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and also directly connected as (12, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (17, 21) -> Nodes 17 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> Nodes 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and also directly connected as (5, 16) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> Nodes 11 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and also directly connected as (11, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 16) -> Nodes 3 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and also directly connected as (3, 16) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 6) -> Nodes 10 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (18, 7) -> Nodes 18 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> Nodes 7 and 5 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipping Node 8 as it has no 2-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2
