Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Nodes 5 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 28) -> Nodes 5 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 28) -> Nodes 14 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Nodes 7 and 12 are connected. Continue to check the third node.
        * Pair 1 continued: (12, 17) -> Nodes 12 and 17 are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 7, 17>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 7, 17>)

* Node 2:
    * No pair involving Node 2 can form a triangle since there are no other nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pair involving Node 3 can form a triangle since there are no other nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 25) -> Nodes 8 and 25 are connected. Continue to check the third node.
        * Pair 1 continued: (25, 6) -> Nodes 25 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 8, 25>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<4, 8, 25>)

* Node 5:
    * No pair involving Node 5 can form a triangle since all other nodes connected to Node 5 are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pair involving Node 6 can form a triangle since all other nodes connected to Node 6 are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> Nodes 13 and 17 are connected. Continue to check the third node.
        * Pair 1 continued: (17, 12) -> Nodes 17 and 12 are connected. Triangle formed: <7, 13, 17>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<7, 13, 17>)

* Nodes 8, 9, 10:
    * Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 8, 9, or 10 to form triangles.

* Nodes 11-16:
    * Skipped as individual nodes have already been covered and higher numbered nodes will not form triangles with them.

* Node 17:
    * No pair involving Node 17 can form a triangle since all other nodes connected to Node 17 are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 18-29:
    * Skipped for the same reason as above.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (<1, 7, 17>, <4, 8, 25>), 
* Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

So, the output would be [2].
