Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will now determine the number of triangles in the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges.

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
            * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> Directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
            * Pair 2: (0, 10) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (13, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
            * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> Directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 10:
            * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
            * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 11:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 or less as they are smaller than 11.
            * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 12:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 11 or less as they are smaller than 12.
            * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 13:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 12 or less as they are smaller than 13.
            * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 14:
            * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
            * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

        Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
