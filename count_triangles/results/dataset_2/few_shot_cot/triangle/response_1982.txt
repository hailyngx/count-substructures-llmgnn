Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected as there is no edge (6, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected as there is no edge (15, 16) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 5) -> 15 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (15, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (15, 8) -> 15 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (15, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (15, 18) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 14) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are not connected as there is no edge (2, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 11 to 19.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Pair 1: (18, 13) -> 18 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are connected as (18, 13) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 12 as they are smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 14 as they are smaller than 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 15 as they are smaller than 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 16 as they are smaller than 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 17 as they are smaller than 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 18 as they are smaller than 19.
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors as shown in the adjacency list, and they are connected as (10, 11) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
