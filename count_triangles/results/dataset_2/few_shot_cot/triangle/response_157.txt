Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 24) -> 4 and 24 are directly connected as (4, 24) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are directly connected as (14, 18) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are directly connected as (8, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are directly connected as (18, 19) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (18, 5) -> 18 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (27, 24) -> 27 and 24 are directly connected as (27, 24) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (25, 28) -> 25 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (27, 22) -> 27 and 22 are directly connected as (27, 22) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (27, 1) -> 27 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 13) -> Self loop. Not considered for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (14, 25) -> 14 and 25 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 10: 1
* Node 11: 0
* Node 12: 1
* Node 13: 0
* Node 14: 1
* Node 15: 0
* Node 16: 1
* Node 17: 1
* Node 18: 1
* Node 19: 1
* Node 20: 0
* Node 21: 0
* Node 22: 1
* Node 23: 0
* Node 24: 1
* Node 25: 0
* Node 26: 1
* Node 27: 1
* Node 28: 1
* Node 29: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 12

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 24, 0>, <14, 18, 1>, <8, 5, 2>, <18, 19, 3>, <27, 22, 7>, <27, 24, 4>, <22, 26, 10>, <24, 4, 27>, <17, 28, 21>, <13, 8, 26>, <28, 22, 10>, <2, 3, 5>.
