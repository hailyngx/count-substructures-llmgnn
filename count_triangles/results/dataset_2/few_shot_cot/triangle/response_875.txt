* Node 2:
    - Unique Triangles: <4, 12, 14>, <4, 2, 6>

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    - Unique Triangles: <2, 4, 6>, <4, 12, 14>

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    - Unique Triangles: <9, 5, 6>

* Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    - Unique Triangles: <11, 14, 18>
