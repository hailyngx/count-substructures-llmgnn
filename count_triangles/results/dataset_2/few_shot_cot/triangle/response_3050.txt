Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skipping additional calculations as we must focus on 2-hop neighbors or higher. All pairs are smaller than or equal to Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 3, 4, and 5:
    * Skipped because they are smaller than Node 6.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because they are smaller than Node 10.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 4 and 1 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 4 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 1 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 11, 12, and 13:
    * Skipped because they are smaller than Node 14.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, and 9 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Nodes 7, 8, 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Nodes 11, 12, 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
