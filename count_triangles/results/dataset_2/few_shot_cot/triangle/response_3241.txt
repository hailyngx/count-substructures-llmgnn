Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the previous example, let's determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 11) -> 12 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (13, 1) -> 13 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 5) -> 10 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 10 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs that can form triangles with larger numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
