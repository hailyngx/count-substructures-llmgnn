Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the example, we can now determine the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Edge (0, 14) and (0, 15) both exist. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (7, 1) shown in the edge list. They share another neighbor, i.e., 11, forming a triangle. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (12, 10) shown in the edge list. They share another neighbor, i.e., 13, forming a triangle. Triangle formed.
