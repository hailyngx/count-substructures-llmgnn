Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 14) + 2 (Node 15) = 11.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
