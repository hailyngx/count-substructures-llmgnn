Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 8) -> Node 2, 8, 1 form a triangle <1, 2, 8>.
    * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (12, 11) -> Node 2, 12, 11 form a triangle <2, 11, 12>.
    * Pair 8: (13, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (13, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Node 3, 6, 8 form a triangle <3, 6, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Node 4, 6, 13 form a triangle <4, 6, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with any pair of these nodes as there are no nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> Node 8, 12, 14 form a triangle <8, 12, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9 and Node 10:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (14, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [6].
