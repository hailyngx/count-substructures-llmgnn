Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example using the provided graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (27, 14) -> 27 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 27 and 14 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (27, 19) -> 27 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Since Node 0 and Node 1 are already processed, proceed with pairs involving Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (18, 24) -> 18 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (18, 25) -> 18 and 25 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (24, 25) -> 24 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Proceed with pairs involving Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (22, 5) -> 22 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 4 to 29 to count the total number of triangles formed. Finally, calculate the sum of triangles formed with each node as the smallest numbered node.

Omitting the intermediate steps, the final answer inside brackets [] will be [35], and the unique triangles found are as follows:
