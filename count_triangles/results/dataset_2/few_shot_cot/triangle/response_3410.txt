Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the output is [ <3, 1, 4>, <3, 1, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <0, 3, 5> ].
