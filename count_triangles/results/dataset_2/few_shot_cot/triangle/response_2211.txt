Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (5, 8) (5, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
[1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph: <4, 0, 7>.
