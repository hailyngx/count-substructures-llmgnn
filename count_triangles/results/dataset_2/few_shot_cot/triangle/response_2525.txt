Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) - 6 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 17) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) - 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 12) is in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as all other 1-hop neighbors of 1 have smaller identifiers.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the only neighbor has a smaller identifier.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the only neighbor has a smaller identifier.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 16) + 2 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 1 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 1 (Node 26) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
