Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Not considered as no pair with higher-numbered nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
