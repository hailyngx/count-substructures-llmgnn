Response:
Following the step-by-step triangle counting process for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (7, 27) -> 7 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (0, 23) -> 0 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 28) -> 1 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * No possible triangles as there are no other nodes connected to Node 3.

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 29) -> 4 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 24) -> 4 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
            * Following the same process as above, we find the number of triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node is 1, with Node 6 is 1, with Node 7 is 1, with Node 8 is 0, and with Node 9 is 0.

        * Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
            * Following the same process as above, we find the number of triangles with Node 10 as the smallest node is 0, with Node 11 is 1, with Node 12 is 1, with Node 13 is 0, and with Node 14 is 2.

        * Nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
            * Continuing the process, we find the number of triangles with Node 15 as the smallest node is 1, with Node 16 is 0, with Node 17 is 4, with Node 18 is 1, and Node 19 is not connected to any other nodes.

        * Nodes 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24:
            * Following the same process as above to find the number of triangles with Node 20 as the smallest node is 0, with Node 21 is 0, with Node 22 is 1, with Node 23 is 0, and with Node 24 is 2.

        * Nodes 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
            * Calculating the number of triangles with Node 25 as the smallest node is 0, with Node 26 is 2, with Node 27 is 1, with Node 28 is 0, and with Node 29 is 1.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 4 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 1 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 2 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 2 (Node 26) + 1 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 1 (Node 29) = 25.

        Therefore, there are 25 triangles in the given graph.

        Therefore, the final answer is [25].
