Response:
Following the step-by-step process as explained in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
        * No triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node since there are no 2 other nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5

    Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
