Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Triangles <1, 3, 8> (1-3-8)
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 23) -> Triangles <2, 4, 23> (2-4-23)
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Triangles <3, 5, 15> (3-5-15)
    * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> Triangles <5, 17, 20> (5-17-20)
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Triangles <7, 14, 20> (7-14-20)
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangles <4, 9, 27> (4-9-27)
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 19.

* Node 20:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 20.

* Node 21:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 21.

* Node 22:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 22.

* Node 23:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 23.

* Node 24:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 24.

* Node 25:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 25.

* Node 26:
    * No triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 26.

* Node 27:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 27.

* Node 28:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 28.

* Node 29:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as only one connected pair exists for Node 29.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
