Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 15) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 15) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 15) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing the same approach for the remaining nodes in the graph:

* Total triangles in the graph: [[0]].
  
Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, which involves nodes 0, 5, and 16, shown as <0, 5, 16>.
