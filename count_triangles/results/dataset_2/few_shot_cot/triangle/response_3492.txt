Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pairs: (7, 15), (7, 4), (7, 18), (15, 4), (15, 18), (4, 18)
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pairs: (14, 8), (14, 12), (8, 12)
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pairs: (17, 8), (17, 7), (17, 2), (8, 7), (8, 2), (2, 7)
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - Pairs: (0, 12)
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Pairs: (11, 19), (11, 18), (5, 19), (5, 18), (19, 18)
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pairs: (13, 15)
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pairs: (2, 18), (2, 9), (2, 7), (18, 9), (18, 7), (9, 7)
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pairs: (13, 16), (13, 9), (16, 9)
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Pairs: (14, 13), (14, 7), (14, 9), (13, 7), (13, 9), (7, 9)
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    - Pairs: (5, 19), (5, 18), (19, 18)
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    - Pairs: (8, 16), (8, 9), (16, 9)
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    - Pairs: (0, 16), (0, 6), (16, 6)
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    - Pairs: (0, 7), (0, 5), (0, 19), (7, 5), (7, 19), (5, 19)
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
