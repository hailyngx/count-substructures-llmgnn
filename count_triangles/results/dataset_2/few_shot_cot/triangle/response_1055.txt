Response:
Following the instructions from the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are directly connected as (4, 0) and (0, 12) in the edge list. Also, 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 12) -> 18 and 12 are directly connected as (18, 0) and (0, 12) in the edge list. Also, 18 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<0, 4, 12>, <0, 12, 18>)

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not directly connected, but 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are directly connected as (2, 3) in the edge list. Also, 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 3, 16>)

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are directly connected as (4, 16) in the edge list. Also, 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<4, 16, 18>)

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are directly connected as (7, 17) in the edge list. Also, 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<7, 9, 17>)

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * Since there are no pairs to form triangles with these nodes, no triangles can be formed starting from them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
