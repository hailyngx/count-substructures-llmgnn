Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (22, 7) -> Triangle <0, 22, 7> formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 15) -> Triangle <0, 7, 15> formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (15, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (26, 17) -> Triangle <1, 26, 17> formed.
    * Pair 2: (26, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 2) -> Triangle <1, 17, 2> formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (22, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 21) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 21) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 21) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (25, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (25, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 21) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 24) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 24) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5 through 29:
    * Skipping as there are not enough nodes greater than 5 or in the range of 5 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
