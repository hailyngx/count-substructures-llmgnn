Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 5: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 5: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skip because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

        Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
