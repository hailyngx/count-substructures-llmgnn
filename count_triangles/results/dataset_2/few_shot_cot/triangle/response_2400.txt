Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9)

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the earlier example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed (0, 5, 6) <0, 5, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed (0, 5, 7) <0, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed (0, 5, 9) <0, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed (0, 6, 2) <0, 6, 2>.
    * Pair 6: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed (0, 7, 5) <0, 7, 5>.
    * Pair 8: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed (0, 2, 9) <0, 2, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0).
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. Triangle formed (1, 2, 4) <1, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. Triangle formed (1, 2, 9) <1, 2, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. Triangle formed (1, 4, 9) <1, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1).
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected. Triangle formed (2, 3, 4) <2, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2).
    * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 all do not have triangles with at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
