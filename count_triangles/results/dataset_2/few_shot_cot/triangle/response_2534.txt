Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Skipped because 3 is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) - Skipped because 3 is smaller than 14.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) - Skipped because 3 is smaller than 11.
    * Pair 4: (3, 2) - Skipped because 3 is smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Skipped because 3 is smaller than 9.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) - Skipped because 3 is smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) - Skipped because 9 is smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) - Both 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 0 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) - Both 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) - Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 14) - Both 0 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 2) - Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 2) - Both 14 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 14 and 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) - Both 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no 1-hop neighbors greater than 5. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no 1-hop neighbors greater than 7. No triangle formed.

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8, 9, or 10.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 8 as they are smaller than 11. No triangle formed.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 12. No triangle formed.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 and 12 as they are smaller than 13. No triangle formed.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 7 as they are smaller than 14. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [4].
