Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 1) - 11 and 1 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) - 11 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) - 11 and 12 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) - 1 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 12) - 1 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 12) - 6 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) - 10 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 6) - 10 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) - 10 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 6) - 11 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 12) - 11 and 12 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 6: (6, 12) - 6 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Following the same approach for the remaining nodes:

* Node 2:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles: 1

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [6].
