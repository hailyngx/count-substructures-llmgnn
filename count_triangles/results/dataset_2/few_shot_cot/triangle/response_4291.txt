Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 15 are also connected. Definition 1: triangle formed by 0, 1, 15.
    * Pair 2: (0, 16) -> 0 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 19) -> 0 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 19 are also connected. Definition 2: triangle formed by 0, 19, 7.
    * Pair 4: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 1 are also connected. Definition 3: triangle formed by 0, 1, 18.
    * Pair 5: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 13 are also connected. No new triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also connected. Definition 4: triangle formed by 1, 5, 18.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 14 are also connected. Definition 5: triangle formed by 1, 14, 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4 to 29:
    * Similar step-by-step analysis will be applied to Nodes 4 to 29.

After going through each node, we find the unique triangles:
<0, 1, 15>
<0, 1, 18>
<0, 1, 19>
<1, 5, 18>
<1, 14, 12>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
