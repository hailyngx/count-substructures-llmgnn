Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach provided in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 0>.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 0>.
    * Pair 7: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 0>.
    * Pair 9: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 8, 0>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

The process will go on for each of the remaining nodes in the graph to identify and count the triangles.
