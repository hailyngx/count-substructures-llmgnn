Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) - Both 1 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 17 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) - Both 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 4 and 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) - Both 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 4 and 17 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 17) - Both 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 14 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 19) - Both 0 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 0 and 19 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 15) - Both 0 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 0 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) - Both 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) - Both 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and 9 and 19 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 15) - Both 13 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, but 13 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) - Both 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, and 7 and 17 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
