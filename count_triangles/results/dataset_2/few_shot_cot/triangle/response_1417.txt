Response:
Following the provided example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
