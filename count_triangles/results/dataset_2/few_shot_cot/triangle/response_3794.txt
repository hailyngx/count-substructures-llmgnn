Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph following the same method as in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [2].
