Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the triangles formed by each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (8, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as (9, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as (6, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (6, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (9, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving 0 and 1 are skipped as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as (7, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0 (No valid triangle can be formed)

* Node 4:
    * Pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 are skipped as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected, hence no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are skipped as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pairs with 1, 2, and 3 are skipped as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles: [2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
