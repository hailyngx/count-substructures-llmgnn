Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 8) -> Both 10 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 2) -> Both 10 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) -> Both 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0 and 1).
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
