Response:
Following the same process as described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 22) -> 8 and 22 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 1 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 3 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 4 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 5 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 6 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Form a triangle with Node 1 and 5.
    * Pair 2: (1, 23) -> 1 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 10 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 11 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 12 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 13 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 14 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 15 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 16 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 17 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 18 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 19 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 20:
    * Pair 1: (15, 29) -> Form a triangle with Node 15 and 29.
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 21 to 29:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 20.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 20) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
