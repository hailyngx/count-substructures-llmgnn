Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

- Start with Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (10, 0) -> 10 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are directly connected. We now have a triangle <0, 8, 14> involving Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Move to Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are directly connected. We now have a triangle <1, 12, 14> involving Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Proceed to Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs involving smaller numbered nodes. No triangle formed.

- Move on to Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 16) -> 0 and 16 are directly connected. We now have a triangle <0, 16, 18> involving Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Continue with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    - No triangles formed with these nodes.

- Moving on to Nodes 10, 11, 12:
    - No triangles formed with these nodes.

- Proceeding to Nodes 13, 14, 15:
    - Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are directly connected. We now have a triangle <13, 14, 12> involving Node 13.
    - Pair 2: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Moving to Nodes 16, 17, 18:
    - Pair 1: (18, 15) -> 18 and 15 are directly connected. We now have a triangle <15, 16, 18> involving Node 15.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Finally, Node 19:
    - No triangles formed with Node 19.

Adding up the triangles from each node:
Total triangles in the graph: [1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 15) = 5]

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
