Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the graph provided, let's find the number of triangles:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Connected to both nodes 2 and 7. Not connected to each other. No triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Directly connected. Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
        * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Directly connected. Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
        * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Connected to both nodes 2 and 7. Not connected to each other. No triangle.
        * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Directly connected. Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
        * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Connected to both nodes 4 and 7. Not connected to each other. No triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Connected to both nodes 0 and 9. Not connected to each other. No triangle.
        * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Connected to both nodes 1 and 9. Not connected to each other. No triangle.
        * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Directly connected. Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
        * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> Directly connected. Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Directly connected. Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
        * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Connected to both nodes 4 and 9. Not connected to each other. No triangle.
        * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Connected to both nodes 7 and 8. Not connected to each other. No triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Directly connected. Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
        * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Directly connected. Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
        * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Directly connected. Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Connected to both nodes 0 and 2. Not connected to each other. No triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
