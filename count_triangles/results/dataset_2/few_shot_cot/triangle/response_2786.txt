Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 24) -> 12 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 24 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 26) -> 12 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (24, 26) -> 24 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 24 and 26 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles involving Node 0: <0, 12, 24>, <0, 12, 26>

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 3 to 29. Then calculate the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found inside brackets [].

Complete the counting and listing process for Nodes 3 to 29 before calculating the total number of triangles in the graph.
