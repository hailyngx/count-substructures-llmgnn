Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5)

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Node 0 and Node 5 are connected, but there is no edge between them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Node 0 is connected to Node 8, but there is no edge between Node 0 and Node 8 directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Node 6 and Node 7 are connected, but there is no edge between them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Node 6 and Node 9 are connected, but there is no edge between them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and Node 9 are connected, but there is no edge between them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Node 0 is connected to Node 8, but there is no edge between them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and Node 9 are connected, but there is no edge between them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Node 4 and Node 9 are connected, but there is no edge between them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Node 0 and Node 3 are connected, but there is no edge between them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> Node 0 is connected to Node 5, but there is no edge between them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Node 4 and Node 6 are connected, but there is no edge between them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Node 4 and Node 7 are connected, but there is no edge between them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Node 6 and Node 7 are connected, but there is no edge between them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
