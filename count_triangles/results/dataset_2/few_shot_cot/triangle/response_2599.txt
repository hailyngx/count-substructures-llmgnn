Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 3 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 3 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Calculating the total number of triangles: 
Total triangles = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <4, 3, 0>, <4, 3, 1>, <5, 4, 7>, <9, 3, 7>, <4, 8, 0>.
