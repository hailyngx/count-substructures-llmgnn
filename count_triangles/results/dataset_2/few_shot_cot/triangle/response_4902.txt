Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, 3, and node 1

Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
