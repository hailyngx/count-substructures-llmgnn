Response:
Following the same algorithm as shown in the example above to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) - Forms a triangle with Node 6: <0, 9, 19>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) - Forms a triangle with Node 19: <0, 9, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (19, 6) - Forms a triangle with Node 9: <0, 19, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) - No triangles formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (29, 21) - No triangles formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 19) - No triangles formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all the pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (20, 28) - No triangles formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (20, 23) - No triangles formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (23, 25) - No triangles formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all the pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (17, 8) - No triangles formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all the pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (20, 10) - No triangles formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (20, 11) - No triangles formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all the pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) - Forms a triangle with Node 5: <5, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip all the pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (20, 9) - Forms a triangle with Node 5: <5, 8, 20>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip all the pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) - No triangles formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (13, 24) - No triangles formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19, Node 20, Node 21, Node 22, Node 23, Node 24, Node 25, Node 26, Node 27, Node 28, and Node 29:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
