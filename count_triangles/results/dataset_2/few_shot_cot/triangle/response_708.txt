Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 10 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.

    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 16. No other nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 17, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 18, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 19. No other nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
