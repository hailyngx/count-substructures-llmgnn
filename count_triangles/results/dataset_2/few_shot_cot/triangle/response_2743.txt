Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two nodes connected to Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected.
    * No other possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 25) -> 3 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Now, let's sum up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 1 (Node 23) + 2 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 1 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 13

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph. The answer is [13].
