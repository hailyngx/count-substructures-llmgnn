Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (12, 14) -> Node 12, 14, and 0 form a triangle. Triangle <0, 12, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Node 1, 7, and 8 form a triangle. Triangle <1, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Node 2, 7, and 13 form a triangle. Triangle <2, 7, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Node 3, 5, and 6 form a triangle. Triangle <3, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Node 4, 5, and 9 form a triangle. Triangle <4, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Node 7, 9, and 4 form a triangle. Triangle <4, 7, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 2) -> Node 10, 13, and 2 form a triangle. Triangle <2, 10, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (13, 2) -> Node 11, 13, and 2 form a triangle. Triangle <2, 11, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
