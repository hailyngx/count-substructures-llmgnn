Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 4, 18>

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 7, 19>

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (7, 28) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 7, 28>
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 9, 18>
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Pair 1: (15, 24) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: <7, 15, 24>
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Pair 1: (18, 27) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: <9, 18, 27>
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 25:
  * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 26:
  * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 27:
  * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 28:
  * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 29:
  * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
