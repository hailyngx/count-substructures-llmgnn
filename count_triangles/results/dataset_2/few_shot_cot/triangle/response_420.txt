Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 11) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 11) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> Connected, no other 1-hop neighbors for a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Connected, no other 1-hop neighbors for a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No new triangles with Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Connected, no other 1-hop neighbors for a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> Connected, no other 1-hop neighbors for a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> Connected, no other 1-hop neighbors for a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No new triangles with Node 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Connected, no other 1-hop neighbors for a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> Connected, no other 1-hop neighbors for a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No new triangles with previous nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 19) -> Connected, no other 1-hop neighbors for a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13:
    * Skipped as they don't have enough nodes to form a triangle with.

* Node 14:
    * No new triangles with previous nodes.
    * Pair 1: (19, 18) -> Connected, no other 1-hop neighbors for a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15, 16, and 17:
    * Skipped as they don't have enough nodes to form a triangle with.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> Connected, no other 1-hop neighbors for a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No new triangles with previous nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19)

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
