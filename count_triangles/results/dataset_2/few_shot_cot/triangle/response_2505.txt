Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (18, 11) -> Form a triangle with Node 19.
    * Pair 2: (18, 19) -> Form a triangle with Node 12.
    * Pair 3: (11, 19) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 19) -> Form a triangle with Node 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> Form a triangle with Node 12.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Form a triangle with Node 19.
    * Pair 2: (1, 18) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 18) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Form a triangle with Node 11.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 15) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 15) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (1, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (1, 15) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 15) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (15, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 and 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 0) -> Form a triangle with Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
