Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 13:
    * No possible triangle with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. Node 14:
    * No possible triangle with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [0].
