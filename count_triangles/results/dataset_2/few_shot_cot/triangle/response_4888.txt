Response:
Following the template provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) - Skipped because some nodes are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 16) - Skipped because some nodes are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) - Skipped because some nodes are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 4: (12, 16) - Skipped because some nodes are smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 11:
    * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 12:
    * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 13:
    * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 14:
    * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 15:
    * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 16:
    * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 17:
    * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 18:
    * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 19:
    * No pair to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
