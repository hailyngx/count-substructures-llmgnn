Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

1. Node 0:
    - Skipped pairs with smaller numbered nodes: N/A
    - Pair 1: (3, 24) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (24, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 21) -> Connected as (5, 21). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Skipped pairs with smaller numbered nodes: 0
    - Pair 1: (15, 25) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Skipped pairs with smaller numbered nodes: 0, 1
    - Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Skipped pairs with smaller numbered nodes: 0, 1, 2
    - Pair 1: (9, 24) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Skipped pairs with smaller numbered nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3
    - Pair 1: (25, 8) -> Connected as (25, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    - Skipped pairs with smaller numbered nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    - Pair 1: (14, 6) -> Connected as (14, 6). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Rest of the Nodes:
    - Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9 are skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
  
Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
