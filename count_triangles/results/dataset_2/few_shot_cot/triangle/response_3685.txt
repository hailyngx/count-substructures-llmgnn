Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes with a smaller number. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes with a smaller number. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> Both 13 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected (6, 13) in the edge list. Triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> Both 13 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected (13, 15) in the edge list. Triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> Both 13 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected (13, 6) in the edge list. Triangle found.
    * Pair 2: (13, 9) -> Both 13 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes with a smaller number. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes with a smaller number. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (17, 1) -> Both 17 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected (17, 1) in the edge list. Triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes with a smaller number. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 15) -> Both 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected (9, 15) in the edge list. Triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skip these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes with greater numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
