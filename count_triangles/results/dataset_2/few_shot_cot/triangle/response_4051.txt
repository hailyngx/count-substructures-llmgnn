Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> There is an edge connecting 0 and 8, but 4 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0. No triangle formed.

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (15, 4) -> There is an edge connecting 1 and 15, but 4 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 1. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (15, 11) -> 15 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, and 11 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, but 15 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.

            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10. No other nodes left to form triangles.

        * Node 11:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 11. No other nodes left to form triangles.

        * Node 15:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 15. No other nodes left to form triangles.

        * Node 16:
            * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, and 2 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 is a 1-hop neighbor of 16, and 10 is a 1-hop neighbor of 16, but 2 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 is a 1-hop neighbor of 16, but 6 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 16. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (9, 10) -> Both 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, but 9 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (9, 6) -> Both 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, but 9 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (10, 6) -> 10 is a 1-hop neighbor of 16, but 6 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 16. No triangle formed.

        * Node 17:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 16 as they are smaller than 17. No other nodes left to form triangles.

        * Node 18 and Node 19:
            * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 18 or 19.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 16) = 4.

        Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
