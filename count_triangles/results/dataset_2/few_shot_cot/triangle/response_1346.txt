Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected (5, 0) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
