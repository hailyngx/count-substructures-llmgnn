Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by counting the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) - Both 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) - Both 8 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) - Both 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 16) - Both 11 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 6) - 11 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (11, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (16, 6) - Both 16 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) - Both 14 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 8) - Both 14 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 8) - Both 15 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * There are no triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 18) - Both 4 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 18) - Both 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) - Both 7 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) - Both 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) - Both 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) - Both 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
