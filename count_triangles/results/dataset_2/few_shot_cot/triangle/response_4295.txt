Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 8), but since 6 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
