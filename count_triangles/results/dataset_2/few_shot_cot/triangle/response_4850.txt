Response:
Following the same method as illustrated in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 10 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 10) -> Triangle formed with 0-4-10 as 0-4, 4-10, and 0-10 are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 7: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 has been covered in the analysis of Node 0 and will not be repeated.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 10 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 has been covered in the analysis of Node 2 and will not be repeated.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 has been covered in the analysis of Node 0 and will not be repeated.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 has been covered in the analysis of Node 0 and will not be repeated.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Node 6 has been covered in the analysis of Node 0 and will not be repeated.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Node 7 has been covered in the analysis of Node 0 and will not be repeated.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Node 8 has been covered in the analysis of Node 0 and will not be repeated.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Node 9 has been covered in the analysis of Node 0 and will not be repeated.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs remaining for them to form triangles with nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
