Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 13 are directly connected as (1, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 4. No triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 5. No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 6. No triangles formed.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 8. No triangles formed.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 7 and 11 are directly connected as (7, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 10. No triangles formed.

* Node 11:
    * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 11. No triangles formed.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and 1 and 13 are directly connected as (1, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 13. No triangles formed.

* Node 14:
    * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 14. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 12) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
[<1, 3, 5>, <1, 13, 2>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 0>, <7, 9, 11>, <7, 11, 9>, <1, 13, 12>]
