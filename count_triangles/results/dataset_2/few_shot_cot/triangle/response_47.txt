Response:
Let's count the triangles in this graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    - Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 as they are smaller than 13.
    - No triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    - Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    - Pair 1: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0-15 as they are smaller than 16.
    - No triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0-16 as they are smaller than 17.
    - No triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    - Pair 1: (0, 19) -> 0 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 18, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0-18 as they are smaller than 19.
    - No triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are: <1, 0, 5>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 15, 18>, <6, 3, 17>.

So, the final answer is [4].
