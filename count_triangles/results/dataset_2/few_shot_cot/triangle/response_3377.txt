Response:
Let's count the triangles in this graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 28) -> Both 4 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 28 are directly connected as (4, 28) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair including Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (17, 26) -> Both 17 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 17 and 26 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> Both 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 16 are directly connected as (6, 16) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (18, 27) -> Both 18 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 18 and 27 are directly connected as (18, 27) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> Both 10 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 10 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Let's continue this process for Nodes 16, 17, 18, and 19.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
