Response:
Following the example given:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Connected through (4, 9). Now look for nodes that are connected to both 4 and 9.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Connected through (4, 8). Now look for nodes that are connected to both 4 and 8.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Connected through (4, 6). Now look for nodes that are connected to both 4 and 6.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> Connected through (8, 9). Now look for nodes that are connected to both 8 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) - Nodes 10 and 11 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (10, 15) - Nodes 10 and 15 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (10, 13) - Nodes 10 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (11, 15) - Nodes 11 and 15 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (11, 13) - Nodes 11 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (15, 13) - Nodes 15 and 13 are directly connected through (15, 1). Now look for nodes that are connected to both 1 and 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) - Nodes 12 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) - Nodes 12 and 13 are directly connected through (12, 2). Now look for nodes that are connected to both 2 and 13.
    * Pair 3: (12, 3) - Nodes 12 and 3 are directly connected through (12, 3). Now look for nodes that are connected to both 12 and 3.
    * Pair 4: (13, 19) - Nodes 13 and 19 are not directly connected.
