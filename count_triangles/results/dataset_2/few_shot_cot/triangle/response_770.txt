Response:
Following the step-by-step process as instructed in the provided example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Following the same approach for the remaining nodes:
* Node 4: 0 triangles
* Node 5: 0 triangles
* Node 6: 2 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 3 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 1 triangle
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 1 triangle
* Node 15: 6 triangles
* Node 16: 1 triangle
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles

Calculating the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles from each node:
Total triangles = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 + 1 (Node 3) + 0 + 0 + 2 (Node 6) + 0 + 3 (Node 8) + 0 + 1 (Node 10) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 14) + 6 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 + 0

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
