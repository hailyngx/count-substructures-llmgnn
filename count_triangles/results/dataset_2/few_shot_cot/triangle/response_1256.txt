Response:
Applying the same process as described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> Both 3 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> Both 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 10) -> Both 17 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 23) -> 12 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 20) -> 12 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 21) -> 12 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 21) -> 18 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (12, 21) -> 12 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 16) -> 21 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4 to 29:
    * Skipping nodes 4 to 9 as they are isolated or have fewer than 2 nodes greater than them.
    * Moving on to nodes 10 to 29, following the same process as above.

Calculating the total number of triangles from each node computation:

* Summing up the triangles from each node, we get: 
1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 3 (Node 11) + 3 (Node 12) + 3 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 2 (Node 16) + 2 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 20) + 2 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 1 (Node 23) + 2 (Node 24) + 1 (Node 25) + 1 (Node 26) + 1 (Node 27) + 3 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 38

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [38].
