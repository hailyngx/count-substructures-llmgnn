Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 2

Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed. Triangle <0, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed. Triangle <3, 5, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed. Triangle <4, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed. Triangle <6, 3, 7>.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

[<0, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 3, 7>]
