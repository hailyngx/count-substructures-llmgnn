Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <0, 5, 13>
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <0, 5, 14>
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <0, 5, 11>
    * Pair 4: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 5: <1, 6, 7>
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <2, 9, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 7: <4, 11, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
