Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above for each node in the graph given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (1, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
