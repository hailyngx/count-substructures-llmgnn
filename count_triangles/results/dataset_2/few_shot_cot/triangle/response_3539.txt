Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes: 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
     * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
     * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
     * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
     * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
