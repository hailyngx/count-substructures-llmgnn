Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, we calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Since Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes, it cannot form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 19.

Therefore, there are [19] triangles in the given graph.
