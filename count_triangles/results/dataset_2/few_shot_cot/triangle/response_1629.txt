Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's find all the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 10 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 16) -> 0 and 16 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:

    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:

    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [4].
