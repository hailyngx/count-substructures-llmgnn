Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No new triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No new triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No new triangles can be formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No new triangles can be formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No new triangles can be formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No new triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
