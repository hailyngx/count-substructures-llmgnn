Response:
Following the step-by-step method shown in the example above, we will go through each node in the graph to count the number of triangles. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 24) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 29) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (18, 24) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (18, 29) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (18, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (24, 29) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (24, 12) - Triangle formed. <0, 24, 12>
    * Pair 10: (29, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipping as there are no 2 pairs involving Node 1 that can form a triangle.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (19, 29) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (14, 27) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 20) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (27, 20) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (29, 27) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 24) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

There are many more nodes to go through to find all the triangles in this graph. Let's continue the process for each node until all possibilities have been explored.
