Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    No connections, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 1:
    - <1, 13, 15> (1, 13) and (13, 15) are connected. Triangle formed.
    - <1, 15, 10> (1, 15) and (15, 10) are connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - <2, 4, 19> (2, 4) and (4, 19) are connected. Triangle formed.
    - <2, 8, 17> (2, 8) and (8, 17) are connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - <3, 13, 15> (3, 13) and (13, 15) are connected. Triangle formed.
    - <3, 13, 17> (3, 13) and (13, 17) are connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - <4, 19, 2> (4, 19) and (19, 2) are connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - <5, 13, 16> (5, 13) and (13, 16) are connected. Triangle formed.

    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    No connections, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 8:
    No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - <9, 11, 19> (9, 11) and (11, 19) are connected. Triangle formed.
    - <9, 11, 15> (9, 11) and (11, 15) are connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 12:
    - <12, 16, 19> (12, 16) and (16, 19) are connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    No additional triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    No additional triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:

* Node 17:
    No additional triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    No connections, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 19:
    - <19, 12, 16> (19, 12) and (12, 16) are connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 17.

Therefore, there are [17] triangles in the given graph.
