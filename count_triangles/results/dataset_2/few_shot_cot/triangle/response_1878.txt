    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6, 9, and 5 are connected. Triangle formed: <5, 6, 9>
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7, 12, and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8, 11, and 6 are connected. Triangle formed: <6, 8, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10, 12, and 9 are connected. Triangle formed: <9, 10, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
