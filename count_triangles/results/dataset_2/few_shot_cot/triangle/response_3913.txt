Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Form a triangle with node 4. Triangle: <5, 9, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> Both 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Form a triangle with node 4. Triangle: <5, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 4) -> Form a triangle with node 5. Triangle: <9, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 7: (1, 3) -> Form a triangle with node 4. Triangle: <1, 3, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Form a triangle with node 4. Triangle: <9, 3, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
