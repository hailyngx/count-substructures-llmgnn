Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will now find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * No additional triangles found with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * No additional triangles found with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (1, 6) in the edge list.
    * No additional triangles found with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (already considered).
    * No additional triangles found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (0, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No additional triangles found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (0, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (0, 7) in the edge list.
    * No additional triangles found with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
