Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 26) -> Forms a triangle with Node 19.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 26) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (22, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15.
    * Pair 2: (22, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 18.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 22) -> Forms a triangle with Node 26.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 18.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (21, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Other nodes with no triangles:
    - Node 11: 0 triangles
    - Node 13: 0 triangles
    - Node 14: 0 triangles
    - Node 16: 0 triangles
    - Node 17: 0 triangles
    - Node 18: 0 triangles
    - Node 19: 0 triangles
    - Node 20: 0 triangles
    - Node 21: 0 triangles
    - Node 22: 0 triangles
    - Node 23: 0 triangles
    - Node 24: 0 triangles
    - Node 25: 0 triangles
    - Node 26: 0 triangles
    - Node 27: 0 triangles
    - Node 28: 0 triangles
    - Node 29: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
