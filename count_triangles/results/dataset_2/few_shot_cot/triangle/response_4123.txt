Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 9, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, 2, 9, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the same approach outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. No additional triangle formed because we already counted <0, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip Pair 1 (3, 0) as it was counted in the triangle with Node 0 as the smallest node.
    * Skip Pair 2 (3, 2) as it was counted in the triangle with Node 2 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. No additional triangle formed because we already counted <2, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
