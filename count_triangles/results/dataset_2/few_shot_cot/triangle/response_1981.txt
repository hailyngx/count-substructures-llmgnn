Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (14, 25) -> 14 and 25 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (14, 23) -> 14 and 23 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (25, 23) -> 25 and 23 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (18, 12) -> 18 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (24, 28) -> 24 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Pair 1: (27, 29) -> 27 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

- Node 18:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 17 as they are smaller than 18.
    - No possible triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

- Nodes 19 to 29:
    - Skipped due to similar reasons as mentioned above.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
