Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    - Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    - Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    - Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    - Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    - Pair 1: (17, 15) -> 17 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 8-19:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
