Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No edge between 3 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 12) -> No edge between 3 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Both 4 and 10 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> No edge between 7 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0, Node 1, and Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left with a higher number to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 triangles.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
