Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (10, 2) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 3) -> 10 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (11, 2) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Both 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> Both 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Now, continue this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, ..., 14, and calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.

* Total triangles in the graph = [total number of triangles considering each node as the smallest numbered node].

Please proceed with the calculation.
