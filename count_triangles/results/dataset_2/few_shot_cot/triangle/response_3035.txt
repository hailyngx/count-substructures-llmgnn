Response:
Alright, let's go ahead and find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

- Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 10 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 10:
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 11:
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 12:
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 13:
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 14:
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
