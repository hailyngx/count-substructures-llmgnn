Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Not connected as there is no edge (9, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> Not connected as there is no edge (9, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 14) -> Not connected as there is no edge (1, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
  Skipping these nodes as they have smaller node numbers to prevent duplicate counts of triangles.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also connected as (5, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> Both 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> Not connected as there is no edge (13, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> Both 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are also connected as (6, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> Not connected as there is no edge (8, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) -> Not connected as there is no edge (8, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 12, 13, and 14, we obtain:
- Node 12: 1 triangle
- Node 13: 0 triangles
- Node 14: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
