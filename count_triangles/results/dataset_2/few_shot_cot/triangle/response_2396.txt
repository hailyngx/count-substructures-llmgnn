Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example using the information given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 5 are also connected as (0, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 3 are also connected as (0, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 2 are also connected as (0, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 6 are also connected as (1, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 11 are also connected as (1, 11) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 14 are also connected as (1, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

Continue this process for each node:

* Node 2:
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11 and Node 12:
    * No pair of nodes to form triangles.

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 16.

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the answer is [16].
