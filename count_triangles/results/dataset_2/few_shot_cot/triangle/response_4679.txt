Response:
Following the same technique as the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 14 are also connected as (7, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 10 are also connected as (7, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 14 are also connected as (7, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 14 are also connected as (7, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 4: 1 triangle
* Node 5: 0 triangles
* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 6 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 1 triangle
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 1 triangle

Finally, calculating the total triangles in the graph:
1(Node 4) + 0(Node 5) + 0(Node 6) + 6(Node 7) + 0(Node 8) + 1(Node 9) + 0(Node 10) + 1(Node 11) + 0(Node 12) + 1(Node 13) + 1(Node 14) = 11

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
