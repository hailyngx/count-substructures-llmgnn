Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the graph provided to count the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (19, 28) -> 19 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles formed using Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 20) -> 13 and 20 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (19, 21) -> 19 and 21 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 23) -> 6 and 23 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, and 13:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are less than 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
