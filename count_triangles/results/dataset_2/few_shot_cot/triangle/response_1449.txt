Response:
Following the same counting procedure as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 and Node 9.
    * Pair 2: (11, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 11 and Node 9.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 11 and Node 13.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 and Node 7.
    * Pair 5: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 and Node 11.
    * Pair 7: (9, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 and Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 and Node 6.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 and Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 and Node 13.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 11 and Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 5 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
