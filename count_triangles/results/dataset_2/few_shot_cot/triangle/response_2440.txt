Response:
Following the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node and the possible triangles they form.

1. Node 0:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 0.

2. Node 1:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 1.

3. Node 2:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 2.

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) - Both 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) - Both 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 4.

6. Node 5:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 5.

7. Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) - Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 7.

9. Node 8:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 8.

10. Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) - Both 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 9 and 10 are directly connected as (9, 10) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

12. Node 11:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 11.

13. Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) - Both 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

14. Node 13:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 13.

15. Node 14:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 14.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles = 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 12) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
