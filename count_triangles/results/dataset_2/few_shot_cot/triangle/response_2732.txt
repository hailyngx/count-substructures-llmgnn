Response:
Following the same method as described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 8) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 0 and Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> Both 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (8, 14) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 0, Node 1, and Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Both 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are connected as (6, 10). 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all previous nodes.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Skip Node 0 and Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (10, 12).

* Node 7:
    * Skip all previous nodes.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 3 and Node 7.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all previous nodes.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip Node 4, Node 6, and Node 12.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Skip Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Both 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are directly connected as (6, 10) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skip Node 1 and Node 10.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:

    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Skip Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> Both 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are connected as (0, 10) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [7].
