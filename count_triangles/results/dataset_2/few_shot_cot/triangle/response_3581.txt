Response:
Following the example provided, let's go through each node step-by-step to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 1 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 10: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as all neighbors are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles as all neighbors are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as all neighbors are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles as all neighbors are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as all neighbors are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as all neighbors are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles as all neighbors are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as all neighbors are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 4 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
