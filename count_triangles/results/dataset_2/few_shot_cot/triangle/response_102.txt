Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> Both 1 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> Both 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (15, 12) -> Both 15 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> Both 4 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> Both 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (18, 0) -> Both 18 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (16, 8) -> Both 16 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 10) -> Both 16 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> Both 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> Both 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> Both 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 5) -> Both 14 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> Both 6 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> Both 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 11) -> Both 17 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Both 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (19, 16) -> Both 19 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (15, 14) -> Both 15 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
