Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> Node 1, 3, and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (15, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (15, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (18, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 16) -> Node 3, 16, and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> Node 3, 0, and 1 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (14, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 9) -> Node 14, 9, and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> Node 0, 9, and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> Node 14, 16, and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 16) -> Node 9, 16, and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 16) -> Node 6, 16, and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 15) -> Node 18, 15, and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6 and 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (17, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 5) -> Node 17, 5, and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 13 to 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
