Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example provided above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 9.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> Node 0 makes a triangle with nodes 5 and 1.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Node 1 makes a triangle with nodes 5 and 8.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Node 3 makes a triangle with nodes 5 and 4.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Node 3 makes a triangle with nodes 4 and 7.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Node 4 makes a triangle with nodes 7 and 3.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> Node 4 makes a triangle with nodes 0 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Node 5 makes a triangle with nodes 9 and 8.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Node 5 makes a triangle with nodes 8 and 1.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) -> Node 5 makes a triangle with nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 5: (5, 3) -> Node 5 makes a triangle with nodes 3 and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> Node 7 makes a triangle with nodes 4 and 3.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Node 7 makes a triangle with nodes 8 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Node 8 makes a triangle with nodes 5 and 1.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> Node 8 makes a triangle with nodes 7 and 4.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> Node 9 makes a triangle with nodes 5 and 8.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 4 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 16.

Therefore, there are [16] triangles in the given graph.
