Response:
Following the same steps as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0:
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (7, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Both 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 11) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (9, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Both 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (6, 11) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 8) -> Both 13 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (13, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Node 9:
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Node 10:
    Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (13, 11) -> Both 13 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are connected as (13, 11) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

13. Node 12:
    Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 13:
    Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. Node 14:
    Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
