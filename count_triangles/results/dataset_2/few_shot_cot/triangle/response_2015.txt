Response:
Following the step-by-step process as outlined in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles formed in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 13>
    * No more pairs possible for Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Triangle formed: <1, 3, 15>
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 15) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 15>
    * No more pairs possible for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 19>
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs possible for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 1, 9>
    * No more pairs possible for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs possible for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs possible for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No more pairs possible for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs possible for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8: 
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Triangle formed: <8, 9, 13>
    * No more pairs possible for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No more pairs possible for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Nodes 10 to 19:
    * Skipped because there are no nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
