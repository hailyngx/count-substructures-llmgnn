Response:
Following the same method as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Several pairs involving Node 0 and Node 1 are skipped due to smaller node numbers.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 3) -> 12 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller node numbers than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 0) -> 11 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [12].
