Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) - Directly connected. (Edge: (0, 4) and (0, 19))
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - Directly connected. (Edge: (0, 4) and (9, 0))
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) - Directly connected. (Edge: (1, 7) and (1, 10))
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as it only has one connection.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 5) - Directly connected. (Edge: (3, 11) and (3, 5))
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) - Directly connected. (Edge: (4, 8) and (4, 6))
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (16, 14) - Directly connected. (Edge: (5, 16) and (5, 14))
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) - Directly connected. (Edge: (6, 10) and (6, 19))
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) - Directly connected. (Edge: (7, 12) and (7, 17))
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) - Directly connected. (Edge: (8, 15) and (8, 14))
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (18, 15) - Directly connected. (Edge: (9, 15) and (9, 18))
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10 to 19 - Skipping them as they were already handled in previous cases.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 9

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the provided graph is [9].
