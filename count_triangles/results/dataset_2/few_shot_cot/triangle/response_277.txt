Response:
Following the step-by-step process demonstrated in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping Node 2 as it is not the smallest numbered node involved in any triangle.

* Node 3:
    * You can skip Node 3 because all possible pairs involving Node 3 as the smallest numbered node have already been accounted for.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 5 for the same reason as Node 3.

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 6 as it involves smaller numbered nodes in all possible triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip Node 7 due to smaller numbered nodes forming all possible triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 8 as it involves smaller numbered nodes in all possible triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 9 as it involves smaller numbered nodes in all possible triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
