Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:
  
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Skip because 1 and 2 are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (1, 0, 11) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 12) -> Both 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (2, 0, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (10, 0, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (11, 12) -> Both 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 1, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (3, 1, 10) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 10) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Both 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
