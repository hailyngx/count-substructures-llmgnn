Response:
Following the method explained in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 0, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 1, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are connected and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 2, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are connected and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 5, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles found for each node:
1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 5) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Putting the unique triangles found inside brackets.
[<8, 13, 0>, <5, 9, 1>, <5, 12, 14>]
