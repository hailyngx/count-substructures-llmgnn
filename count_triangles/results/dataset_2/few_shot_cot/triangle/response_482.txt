Response:
Following the same method as described before, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Node 0 and Node 1 are directly connected. Looking for a common neighbor for a possible triangle.
        * Common neighbor is Node 9.
            * Triangle found: <0, 1, 9>
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Node 0 and Node 2 are directly connected. Looking for a common neighbor for a possible triangle.
        * Common neighbor is Node 7.
            * Triangle found: <0, 2, 7>
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> Node 0 and Node 7 are directly connected. Looking for a common neighbor for a possible triangle.
        * Common neighbor is Node 1.
            * Triangle found: <0, 7, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Skip because 2 is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Node 1 and Node 6 are directly connected. Looking for a common neighbor for a possible triangle.
        * Common neighbor is Node 9.
            * Triangle found: <1, 6, 9>
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> Node 1 and Node 7 are directly connected. Looking for a common neighbor for a possible triangle.
        * Common neighbor is Node 9.
            * Triangle found: <1, 7, 9>
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> Node 1 and Node 8 are directly connected. Looking for a common neighbor for a possible triangle.
        * Common neighbor is Node 9.
            * Triangle found: <1, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Node 2 and Node 4 are directly connected. Looking for a common neighbor for a possible triangle.
        * No common neighbor found. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Node 2 and Node 7 are directly connected. Looking for a common neighbor for a possible triangle.
        * Common neighbor is Node 8.
            * Triangle found: <2, 7, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Node 3 and Node 5 are directly connected. Looking for a common neighbor for a possible triangle.
        * No common neighbor found. No triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * No pair for Node 4 to form a triangle.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * No pair for Node 5 to form a triangle.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> Node 6 and Node 1 are directly connected. Looking for a common neighbor for a possible triangle.
        * Common neighbor is Node 9.
            * Triangle found: <6, 1, 9>
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> Node 6 and Node 3 are directly connected. Looking for a common neighbor for a possible triangle.
        * No common neighbor found. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> Node 6 and Node 4 are directly connected. Looking for a common neighbor for a possible triangle.
        * No common neighbor found. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and Node 9 are directly connected. Looking for a common neighbor for a possible triangle.
        * Common neighbor is Node 1.
            * Triangle found: <7, 9, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Node 8 and Node 5 are directly connected. Looking for a common neighbor for a possible triangle.
        * No common neighbor found. No triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * No pair for Node 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
