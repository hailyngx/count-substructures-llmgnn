Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
