Response:
Following the process outlined in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with nodes 4 and 8.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with nodes 4 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 23) -> Triangle formed with nodes 17 and 23.
    * Pair 2: (27, 1) -> Triangle formed with nodes 27 and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Triangle formed with nodes 11 and 14.
    * Pair 2: (11, 18) -> Triangle formed with nodes 11 and 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 29) -> Triangle formed with nodes 11 and 29.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> Triangle formed with nodes 11 and 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (18, 24) -> Triangle formed with nodes 18 and 24.
    * Pair 2: (18, 28) -> Triangle formed with nodes 18 and 28.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 25) -> Triangle formed with nodes 9 and 25.
    * Pair 2: (16, 25) -> Triangle formed with nodes 16 and 25.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 26) -> Triangle formed with nodes 13 and 26.
    * Pair 2: (13, 28) -> Triangle formed with nodes 13 and 28.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 10 to 29 have no triangles when taken as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 12

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
