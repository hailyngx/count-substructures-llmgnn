Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are directly connected. Let's see if there is a node connected to both 0 and 6.
        * Triangle found: <0, 6, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<0, 6, 1>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are directly connected. Let's see if there is a node connected to both 1 and 6.
        * Triangle found: <1, 6, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 6, 0>)

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected. Let's see if there is a node connected to both 6 and 8.
        * Triangle found: <6, 8, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<6, 8, 1>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected. Let's see if there is a node connected to both 3 and 9.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Let's see if there is a node connected to both 7 and 8.
        * Triangle found: <7, 8, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<7, 8, 1>)

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Let's see if there is a node connected to both 1 and 8.
        * Triangle found: <1, 8, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 8, 6>)

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Let's see if there is a node connected to both 8 and 2.
        * Triangle found: <8, 2, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<8, 2, 1>)

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Let's see if there is a node connected to both 4 and 8.
        * Triangle found: <4, 8, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<4, 8, 1>)

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Let's see if there is a node connected to both 1 and 6.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * The only pair to check is (3, 7), but since they are both smaller nodes, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 6, 1>
<1, 6, 0>
<6, 8, 1>
<7, 8, 1>
<1, 8, 6>
<4, 8, 1>
