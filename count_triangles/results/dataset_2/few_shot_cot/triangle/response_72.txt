Response:
Following the process outlined in the initial example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip calculations involving nodes 1 and 2, as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0. Triangle: <0, 6, 3>
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip calculations involving nodes 0 and 2, as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1. Triangle: <1, 4, 7>
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip calculations involving nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangle involving Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip calculations involving nodes 0, 1, and 2, as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3. Triangle: <3, 10, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip calculations involving nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4. Triangle: <4, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip calculations involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, as they are smaller than 5.
    *  No possible triangle involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip calculations involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) ->  5 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6. Triangle: <6, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip calculations involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) ->  4 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7. Triangle: <7, 4, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * No possible triangles with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summing up the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 6

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph:
<0, 6, 3>, <1, 4, 7>, <3, 10, 11>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 5, 7>, <7, 4, 1>.
