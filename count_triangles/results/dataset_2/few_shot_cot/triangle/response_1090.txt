Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in this graph by analyzing each node one by one:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9).
    * Pair 8: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 2 are also connected as (8, 0) and (0, 2). Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>
    * Pair 9: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Repeating the same process for Node 1, we find the following triangles:
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Repeating the same process for Node 2, we find the following triangles:
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Repeating the same process for Node 3, we find the following triangles:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Repeating the same process for Node 4, we find the following triangles:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Repeating the same process for Node 5, we find the following triangles:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Repeating the same process for Node 6, we find the following triangles:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Repeating the same process for Node 7, we find the following triangles:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipping the analysis for these nodes due to a lack of potential triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
