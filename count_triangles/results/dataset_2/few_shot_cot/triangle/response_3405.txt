Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 and Node 13.
        * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> Nodes 0 and 5 are directly connected, but Node 5 is not a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (0, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 and Node 14.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 and Node 9.
        * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 and Node 13.
        * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> Nodes 1 and 2 are directly connected, but Node 2 is not a 1-hop neighbor of Node 1. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 and Node 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 2, Node 10, and Node 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Nodes 10 and 12 are directly connected, but Node 12 is not a 1-hop neighbor of Node 3. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4, Node 7, and Node 12.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 6, Node 13, and Node 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 7, Node 12, and Node 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1, Node 8, and Node 9.
        * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 8, Node 9, and Node 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 9, Node 11, and Node 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 10:
        * No pairs to form triangles with Node 10.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 11:
        * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 4, Node 11, and Node 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 12:
        * Pair 1: (12, 3) -> Nodes 12 and 3 are directly connected, but Node 3 is not a 1-hop neighbor of Node 12. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 13:
        * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 13, Node 14, and Node 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 14:
        * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 13, Node 14, and Node 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
