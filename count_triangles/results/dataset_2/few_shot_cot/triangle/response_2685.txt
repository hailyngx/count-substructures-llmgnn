Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Looking for the third node to form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 2>.
    - Pair 4: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (15, 12) -> 15 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (15, 11) -> 15 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Looking for the third node to form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (15, 1) -> 15 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 11, 12>.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (16, 7) -> Both 16 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Looking for the third node to form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (16, 3) -> 16 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Looking for the third node to form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Looking for the third node to form a triangle.
    - Pair 4: (19, 14) -> 19 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (15, 1) -> 15 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (15, 4) -> 15 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Looking for the third node to form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (15, 14) -> 15 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Looking for the third node to form a triangle.
    - Pair 6: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Looking for the third node to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Proceeding in the same manner for Nodes 6 through 19.

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [7].
