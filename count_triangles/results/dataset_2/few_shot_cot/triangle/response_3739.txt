Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3. They are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. They are all smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. They are all smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. They are all smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. They are all smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. They are all smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. They are all smaller than 10.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip all pairs since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 12.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
