Response:
Following the step-by-step process as outlined in the example above to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> Both 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 8).
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> Both 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 13).  
    * Pair 4: (2, 1) -> Both 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 7).  
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> Both 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 10). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 11) -> Both 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 11).
    * Pair 5: (3, 12) -> Both 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 12).  
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (4, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.  
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> Both 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (4, 14). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (5, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (5, 9). Triangle formed.  
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Both 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (6, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> Both 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (6, 13). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13:
    Skipped as they don't have at least two nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [13].
