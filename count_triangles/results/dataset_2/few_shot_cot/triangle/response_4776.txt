Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 1 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 1 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

The process continues for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 until all nodes have been considered. Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is calculated.

The number of triangles in the given graph is: [18].
