Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as demonstrated in the previous example: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Yes, triangle formed with (7, 0) -> <0, 7, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> Yes, triangle formed with (7, 4) -> <4, 7, 9>.
    * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> Yes, triangle formed with (9, 3) -> <1, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 6: (9, 0) -> Yes, triangle formed with (0, 5) -> <0, 9, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Yes, triangle formed with (5, 0) -> <0, 5, 1>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Yes, triangle formed with (7, 1) -> <1, 7, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> No.
    * Pair 5: (9, 7) -> Yes, triangle formed with (9, 1) -> <1, 7, 9>.
    * Pair 6: (9, 0) -> Yes, triangle formed with (9, 4) -> <0, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Yes, triangle formed with (7, 2) -> <2, 7, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Yes, triangle formed with (9, 3) -> <1, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> Yes, triangle formed with (0, 2) -> <0, 2, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Yes, triangle formed with (4, 3) -> <3, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Yes, triangle formed with (1, 3) -> <1, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> No.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> No.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
