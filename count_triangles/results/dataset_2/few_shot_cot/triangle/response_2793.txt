Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<1, 12, 7>, <1, 12, 10>)

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<2, 9, 11>, <2, 9, 3>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<3, 6, 12>, <3, 6, 1>)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * No more triangles can be formed with these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
