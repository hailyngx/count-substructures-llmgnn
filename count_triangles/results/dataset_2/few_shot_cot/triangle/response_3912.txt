Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (20, 23) -> 20 and 23 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 26) -> 7 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because there is no edge (7, 26) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 27) -> 9 and 27 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 1) - 12 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (21, 19) -> 21 and 19 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (22, 13) -> 22 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (23, 28) -> 23 and 28 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing the process for Nodes 6 to 29:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 26) -> 10 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6 because there is no edge (10, 26) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 to Node 13:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found so far:

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. 

Here are the unique triangles found:
<20, 0, 23>, <1, 9, 27>, <1, 12, 4>, <21, 19, 2>, <3, 22, 13>, <5, 12, 4>, <12, 23, 28>, <12, 5, 15>.
