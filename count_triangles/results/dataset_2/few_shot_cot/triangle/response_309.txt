Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided and applying it to the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 3) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 1) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Omitted due to smaller numbered nodes already being examined.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 3) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 6) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 6) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 14) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Omitted due to smaller numbered nodes already being examined.

* Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * All omitted due to smaller numbered nodes already being examined.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 2) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
