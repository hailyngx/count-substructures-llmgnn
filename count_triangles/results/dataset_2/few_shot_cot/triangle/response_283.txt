    * No pairs available to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <6, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> Triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <6, 5, 14>
    * No more pairs available to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: <7, 11, 14>
    * Pair 2: (11, 3) -> Triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: <7, 11, 3>

    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: <9, 8, 10>
    * No more pairs available to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No pairs available to form triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No pairs available to form triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 13.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
