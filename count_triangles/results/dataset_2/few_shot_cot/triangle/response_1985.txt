Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 29) -> 0 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 0 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 27) -> 1 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 27 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No triangle formed for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4. 
    * Pair 1: (4, 23) -> 4 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 4 and 23 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 28) -> 4 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 28 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 10 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 do not form any triangles based on the available information.

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 16.
    * Pair 1: (16, 10) -> 16 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 16, and 16 and 10 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (16, 14) -> 16 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 16, and 16 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29 do not form any triangles based on the available information.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 16) = 10

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
