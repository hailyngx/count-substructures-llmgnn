Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) - Skipped as 3 is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) - Skipped as 3 is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 3: (0, 17) - Both 0 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) - Both 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) - Both 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) - Both 0 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (12, 5) - Skipped as 5 is smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) - Both 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (7, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) - Skipped as 4 is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) - Skipped as 9 is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) - Both 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (9, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) - Skipped as 3 is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) - Skipped as 3 is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 3: (8, 19) - Both 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (8, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) - Both 16 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Other Nodes:
    * Nodes 10 to 19 do not have at least two 1-hop neighbors greater than them, so no triangles are formed from them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
