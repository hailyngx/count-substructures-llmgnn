Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of nodes greater than them.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of nodes greater than 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of nodes greater than 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of nodes greater than 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of nodes greater than 13.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of nodes greater than 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
