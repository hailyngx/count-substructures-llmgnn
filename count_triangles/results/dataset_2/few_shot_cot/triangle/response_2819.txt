Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are not connected because (0, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected because (1, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 3 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs of nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
