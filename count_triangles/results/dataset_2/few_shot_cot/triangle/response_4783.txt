Response:
Following the step-by-step instructions provided in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 4 are also directly connected as (5, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 2 are also directly connected as (8, 2) shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 1 are also directly connected as (8, 1) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 2 are also directly connected as (4, 2) shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 1 are also directly connected as (8, 1) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 0 are also directly connected as (8, 0) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skip these nodes as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 8.
