Response:
Following the same process as the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected, but they  are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) - 7 and 1 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
