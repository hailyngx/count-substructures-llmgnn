Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Start by listing 1-hop neighbor sets for each node:
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 1: {3, 10, 11, 14}
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 2: {0, 3, 6}
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 3: {1, 2, 10, 11}
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 8, 13}
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 6: {2, 4, 12, 13}
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 7: {5, 9, 14}
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 8: {0, 4, 12, 13, 14}
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 9: {0, 5, 7, 12}
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 10: {1, 3, 13}
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 11: {1, 3, 12, 14}
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 12: {6, 8, 9, 11}
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 13: {4, 6, 8, 10}
- 1-hop neighbor set of Node 14: {1, 7, 8, 11}

2. Calculating the triangles for each node:
- Node 0: <4, 5, 9> (1 triangle), <4, 8, 12> (1 triangle)
- Node 1: No triangles
- Node 2: No triangles
- Node 3: No triangles
- Node 4: <0, 5, 7> (1 triangle)
- Node 5: No triangles
- Node 6: No triangles
- Node 7: No triangles
- Node 8: No triangles
- Node 9: <0, 5, 7> (1 triangle)
- Node 10: No triangles
- Node 11: No triangles
- Node 12: <4, 9, 12> (1 triangle)
- Node 13: No triangles
- Node 14: No triangles

3. Summarizing the total triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 12) = 4

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
