Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 since there are no nodes greater than 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because the edge (2, 16) is not in the list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 or 1 since they are smaller than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because the edge (10, 13) is not in the list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 5 as they are smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 6 as they are smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 7 as they are smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 8 as they are smaller than 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 9 as they are smaller than 10.

* Node 11:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 10 as they are smaller than 11.

* Node 12:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 11 as they are smaller than 12.

* Node 13:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 12 as they are smaller than 13.

* Node 14:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 13 as they are smaller than 14.

* Node 15:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 14 as they are smaller than 15.

* Node 16:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 15 as they are smaller than 16.

* Node 17:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 16 as they are smaller than 17.

* Node 18:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 17 as they are smaller than 18.

* Node 19:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 18 as they are smaller than 19.

Summing up the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3)

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
