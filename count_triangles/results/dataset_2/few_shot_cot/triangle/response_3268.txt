Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example, let's now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected in the given edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list and both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) compared to 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 9), but since 5 and 9 are smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) compared to 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
