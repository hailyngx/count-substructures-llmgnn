Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (14, 9) -> 14 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 8: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 9: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0) as Node 1 is the smallest in remaining nodes.
        * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0 and 1) as Node 2 is the smallest in remaining nodes.
        * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, and 2) as Node 3 is the smallest in remaining nodes.
        * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, and considering symmetry for each triangle to avoid double-counting:

    * Node 4: 0 triangles
    * Node 5: 2 triangles
    * Node 6: 2 triangles
    * Node 7: 2 triangles
    * Node 8: 0 triangles
    * Node 9: 0 triangles
    * Node 10: 2 triangles
    * Node 11: 2 triangles
    * Node 12: 0 triangles
    * Node 13: 0 triangles
    * Node 14: 0 triangles

Calculating the total number of triangles by summing the triangles found for each node:

[<3, 6, 11>, <3, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 10>, <5, 6, 13>, <7, 5, 10>, <7, 5, 13>, <5, 7, 13>, <11, 0, 14>]

Total triangles: [8]
