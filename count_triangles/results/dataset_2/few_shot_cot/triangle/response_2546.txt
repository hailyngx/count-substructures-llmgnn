Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

This process will need to be continued for Nodes 5 through 19 as well as calculating the total number of triangles from all nodes once the counting is done for each. Let's proceed with the calculations.
