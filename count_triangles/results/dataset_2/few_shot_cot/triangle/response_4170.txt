Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Skipped as Node 0 has no pair of nodes with higher numbers to form triangles with.

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (10, 25) - Both 10 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (10, 12) - Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**
    - Skip any pair involving nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 15) - Both 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 26) - Both 5 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 15) - Both 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 28) - Both 2 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

4. **Node 3:**
    - Skipped as Node 3 has no pair of nodes with higher numbers to form triangles with.

5. **Node 4:**
    - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    - Pair 1: (4, 28) - Both 4 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 25) - Both 4 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. **Node 5:**
    - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

7. **Node 6:**
    - Skipped as Node 6 has no pair of nodes with higher numbers to form triangles with.

8. **Node 7:**
    - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than Node 7. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.

9. Continue this process for Nodes 8, 9, ... until Node 29 following the same logic.

Once all nodes are considered, sum up the total count of triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node.

Finally, output the final answer within brackets [] with unique triangles listed inside <>.

Now, please take some time to calculate the triangles in the graph, and if you encounter any difficulties or need further guidance, feel free to ask for help!
