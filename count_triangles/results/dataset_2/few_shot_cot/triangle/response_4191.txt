Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 0 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes: 3, 11, 2, and 10.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 7, 1, 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Moving on to the next nodes:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes: 6, 9, and 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes: 12 and 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip the pair with smaller node 11.
    * No possible triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip the pair with smaller node 1.
    * No possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
