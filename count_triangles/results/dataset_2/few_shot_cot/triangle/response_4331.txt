Response:
Following the same method as the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 19) -> 0 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (15, 5) -> 15 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are directly connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are directly connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (17, 6) -> 17 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (14, 9) -> 14 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
