Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's proceed with counting the triangles in the given graph. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 11 are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 11 and 15 are also connected. Triangle formed. (<0, 11, 15>)
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 8 are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 9 are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed. (<3, 8, 9>)
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 13 are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 15 are also connected. Triangle formed. (<4, 15, 13>)
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Continuing this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19, we will find the total number of triangles in this graph.

*Summarizing the triangles:*
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 4. 

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
