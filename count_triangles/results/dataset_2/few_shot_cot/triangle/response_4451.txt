Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 29) -> 4 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 29 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (21, 26) -> 21 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 17) -> 21 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (22, 15) -> 22 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (22, 15) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (22, 18) -> 22 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (22, 18) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 23) -> 22 and 23 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (22, 23) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Already counted when calculating triangles for Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (21, 11) -> 21 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (21, 11) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (15, 25) -> 15 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (16, 7) -> Already counted when calculating triangles for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

* Node 20:
    * Pair 1: (18, 20) -> 18 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 20, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 21:
    * Pair 1: (25, 21) -> 25 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 21, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
