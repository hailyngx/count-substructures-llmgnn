Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list. No other nodes connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list. No other nodes connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list. No other nodes connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are connected as shown in the edge list. 1 node connected to both: Node 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are connected as shown in the edge list. 1 node connected to both: Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

We will continue this process for the remaining nodes to find all the triangles.

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are connected as shown in the edge list. No other nodes connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<1, 7, 14>, <8, 15, 16>]
