Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (4, 3) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 7.

        Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
