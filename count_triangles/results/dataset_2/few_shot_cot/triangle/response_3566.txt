Response:
Following the step-by-step method outlined in the example provided, let's go through each node to count the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) - Triangle formed as 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) - Triangle formed as 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) - Triangle formed as 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) - Triangle formed as 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) - Triangle formed as 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) - Triangle formed as 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 12) - Triangle formed as 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (14, 0) - Triangle formed as 14 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 13 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph:

[2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8]

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
