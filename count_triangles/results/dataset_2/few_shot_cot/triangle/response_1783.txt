Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    - <1, 3, 12> is a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    - <2, 5, 10> is a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    - No triangles formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    - No triangles formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    - No triangles formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    - No triangles formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    - No triangles formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    - No triangles formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    - <1, 12, 8> is a triangle with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    - No triangles formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    - No triangles formed with Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 12) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
