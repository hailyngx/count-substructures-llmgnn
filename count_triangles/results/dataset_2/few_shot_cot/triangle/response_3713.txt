Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    - Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    - Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    - Pair 4: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    - Pair 5: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    - Pair 6: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    - Pair 7: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are directly connected as (9, 10), forming a triangle <0, 9, 10>.
    - Pair 8: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    - Pair 9: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    - Pair 10: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    - Pair 11: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    - Pair 12: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<0, 9, 10>)

* Node 1:
    - Continue in a similar manner as above for Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Continue in a similar manner as above for Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Continue in a similar manner as above for Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 8, 13>)

* Node 4:
    - Continue in a similar manner as above for Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Continue in a similar manner as above for Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Continue in a similar manner as above for Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 6, 11>)

* Node 7:
    - Continue in a similar manner as above for Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    - Proceed in a similar manner as above for each of these nodes. 
    - Count the total number of triangles with each of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
[<0, 9, 10>, <3, 8, 13>, <3, 6, 11>]

Therefore, the total number of unique triangles in the given graph is [3].
