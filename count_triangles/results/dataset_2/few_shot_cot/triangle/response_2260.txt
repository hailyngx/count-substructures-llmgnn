Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list. Checking for common neighbors of 0, 1, and 8:
        * Common neighbors of 0 and 1: 4
        * Common neighbors of 0 and 8: 4
        * Triangle <0, 1, 8> found.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list. Checking for common neighbors of 0, 2, and 8:
        * Common neighbors of 0 and 2: 4
        * Common neighbors of 0 and 8: 4
        * Triangle <0, 2, 8> found.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes. No need to check pairs with Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected as (8, 5) in the edge list. Checking for common neighbors of 1, 5, and 8:
        * Common neighbors of 1 and 5: 13
        * Common neighbors of 1 and 8: 13
        * Triangle <1, 5, 8> found.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are connected as (7, 13) in the edge list. Checking for common neighbors of 1, 7, and 13:
        * Common neighbors of 1 and 7: 4
        * Common neighbors of 1 and 13: 4
        * Triangle <1, 7, 13> found.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes. No need to check pairs with Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 3, 4, and 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered nodes.

The process continues for the remaining nodes according to their numbers. Let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 and then sum up the total number of triangles at the end.

[<0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 7, 13>]
