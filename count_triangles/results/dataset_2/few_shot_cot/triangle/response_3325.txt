Response:
Following the steps from the previous example, we will calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 8 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, and 8:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10 and 11:
    * Skipped due to insufficient nodes greater than them.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than it to form a triangle.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 as it is smaller than 13.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with other nodes as they are all smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
