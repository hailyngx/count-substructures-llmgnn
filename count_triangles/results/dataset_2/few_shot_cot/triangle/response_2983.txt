    * Pair 3: (8, 1) - No edge between nodes 8 and 1. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (13, 11) - There is an edge between nodes 13 and 11.
    * Pair 5: (13, 5) - There is an edge between nodes 13 and 5.
    * Pair 6: (11, 5) - There is an edge between nodes 11 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - No edge between nodes 6 and 9. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) - There is an edge between nodes 6 and 13.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) - No edge between nodes 9 and 13. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pairs involving nodes smaller than 4 are skipped. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) - There is an edge between nodes 7 and 11.

    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) - There is an edge between nodes 4 and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, and 10:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least two nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) - There is an edge between nodes 2 and 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least two nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 11) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
