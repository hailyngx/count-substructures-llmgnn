Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8 and Node 9:
        * Skipped as they have fewer than 2 neighbors for triangle formation.

    * Node 10:
        * Skipped as it has fewer than 2 neighbors for triangle formation.

    * Node 11 and Node 12:
        * Skipped as they have fewer than 2 neighbors for triangle formation.

    * Node 13:
        * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node besides those already counted in other nodes.

    * Node 14:
        * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node besides those already counted in other nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<3, 4, 5>
<0, 2, 4>
<5, 9, 13>
<1, 9, 14>
<4, 6, 13>
<0, 4, 13>

Hence, the final answer is [6].
