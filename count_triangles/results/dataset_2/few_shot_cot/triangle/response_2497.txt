Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
