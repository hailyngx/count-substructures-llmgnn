Response:
Following the process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Already counted when processing Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (4, 26) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> Already counted when processing Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> Already counted when processing Node 12.
    * Pair 2: (1, 19) -> There is no edge between 1 and 19. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 20) -> Already counted when processing Node 20.
    * Pair 4: (29, 1) -> Already counted when processing Node 29.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Already counted when processing Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (2, 28) -> Already counted when processing Node 28.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> Already counted when processing Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Already counted when processing Node 15.
    * Pair 2: (3, 22) -> Already counted when processing Node 22.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> Already counted when processing Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Already counted when processing Node 10.
    * Pair 3: (4, 28) -> Already counted when processing Node 28.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Already counted when processing Node 5.
    * Pair 5: (0, 4) -> Already counted when processing Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Already counted when processing Node 11.
    * Pair 2: No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Already counted when processing Node 9.
    * Pair 2: (7, 27) -> Already counted when processing Node 27.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> Already counted when processing Node 12.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> Already counted when processing Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (25, 8) -> Already counted when processing Node 25.
    * Pair 2: (13, 8) -> Already counted when processing Node 13.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Already counted when processing Node 4.
    * Pair 4: (8, 16) -> Already counted when processing Node 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (17, 9) -> Already counted when processing Node 17.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Already counted when processing Node 10.
    * Pair 3: (22, 9) -> Already counted when processing Node 22.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> Already counted when processing Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> Already counted when processing Node 16.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Already counted when processing Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (10, 24) -> Already counted when processing Node 24.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing the process for Nodes 12 to 29:

* Node 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Each of these nodes does not have at least 2 nodes greater than their number to form triangles, thus their total triangles is 0.

After calculating the triangles for all nodes, we can summarize the total number of triangles in the graph:  
[0] 

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
