Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 2, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also connected. Triangle formed <1, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also connected. Triangle formed <1, 4, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 2, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are also connected. Triangle formed <3, 4, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 9, and 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No additional triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 5 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <6, 1, 4>.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 6 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No additional triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 5, 6, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No additional triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
