Response:
Following the same step-by-step process used in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Alright, let's continue with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
