* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) - Both are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) - Both are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 13) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 2) - Both are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 2) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
Final answer: [6].
