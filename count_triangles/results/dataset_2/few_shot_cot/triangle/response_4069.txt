Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 16.

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 10, 9>
