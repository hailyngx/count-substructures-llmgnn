Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are connected, but 2 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 14) in the list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [4].
