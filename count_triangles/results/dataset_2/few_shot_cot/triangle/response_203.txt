Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are connected. 
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<0, 4, 14>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<8, 10, 1>)

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<8, 12, 16>)

Continue the same process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<16, 18, 4>)

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for the remaining nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + ... (for all nodes)
* Total number of triangles = [27]

Therefore, there are 27 triangles in the given graph.
