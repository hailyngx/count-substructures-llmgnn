Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 5: (7, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> Node 4 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 16.

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.
