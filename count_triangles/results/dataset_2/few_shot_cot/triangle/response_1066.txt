Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are connected via node 13, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are connected via node 0, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are connected via node 0, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (18, 20) -> 18 and 20 are connected via node 1, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (18, 21) -> 18 and 21 are connected via node 1, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (18, 24) -> 18 and 24 are connected via node 1, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (18, 7) -> 18 and 7 are connected via node 1, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (20, 21) -> 20 and 21 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (20, 24) -> 20 and 24 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (20, 7) -> 20 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (21, 24) -> 21 and 24 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (21, 7) -> 21 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (24, 7) -> 24 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 22) -> 9 and 22 are connected via node 5, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are connected via node 2, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 25) -> 9 and 25 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (22, 16) -> 22 and 16 are connected via node 5, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (22, 25) -> 22 and 25 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 25) -> 16 and 25 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are connected via node 3, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for all nodes will allow us to find the total number of triangles. Let's now proceed with calculating the total number of triangles and listing them inside brackets [] at the end.
