Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 3 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 8 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 8 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing to check the remaining nodes, we get:

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
