Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 9) -> 14 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 1, as they were already considered.
    * No additional triangle can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 2, as they were already considered.
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Both 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 3, as they were already considered.
    * No additional triangle can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 4, as they were already considered.
    * No additional triangle can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 5, as they were already considered.
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> Both 12 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 7, as they were already considered.
    * No additional triangle can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 9, as they were already considered.
    * No additional triangle can be formed with Node 9.

After examining all nodes and their connections, the count of triangles is [3]. The unique triangles found are <9, 14, 0>, <2, 5, 12>, and <0, 14, 15>.
