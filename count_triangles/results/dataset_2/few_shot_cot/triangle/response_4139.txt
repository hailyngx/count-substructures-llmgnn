Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example given, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and they are connected. Triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 7) -> 12 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The process will continue for Nodes 5 to 14 to calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.
