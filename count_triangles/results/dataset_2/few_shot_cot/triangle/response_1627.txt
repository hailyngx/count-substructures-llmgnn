Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's proceed to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (6, 18) -> Triangle formed with Node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 and Node 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 15 and Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 and Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 12.
    * Pair 2: (9, 17) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 17.
    * Pair 3: (9, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 19.
    * Pair 4: (12, 17) -> Triangle formed with Node 12 and Node 17.
    * Pair 5: (12, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 12 and Node 19.
    * Pair 6: (17, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 17 and Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (15, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 15 and Node 5.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 and Node 8.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 and Node 13.

    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 10) + 6 (Node 7) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
