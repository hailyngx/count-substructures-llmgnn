Response:
Following the method outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected, and (3, 4) is present in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are directly connected, and (0, 3) is present in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are directly connected, but (0, 4) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 20) -> 3 and 20 are directly connected, and (3, 20) is present in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Given the length of this graph, we'll proceed to the remaining nodes following the same method.
