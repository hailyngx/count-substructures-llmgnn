Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) -> Does not lead to a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> Does not lead to a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> Does not lead to a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 14.

Therefore, there are [14] triangles in the given graph.
