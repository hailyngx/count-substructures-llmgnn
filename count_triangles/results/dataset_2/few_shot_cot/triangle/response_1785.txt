Response:
Following the process described in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 24) -> 2 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 24) -> 14 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 8) -> 14 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (24, 8) -> 24 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 22) -> 10 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 13) -> 22 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continued calculations for the remaining nodes follow the same process.

Summarizing the triangles found so far:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 8, 24>, <1, 4, 9>, <4, 11, 18>, and <8, 9, 15>.

Thus, the final answer is [5].
