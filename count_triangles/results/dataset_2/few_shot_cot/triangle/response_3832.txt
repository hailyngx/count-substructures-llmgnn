Response:
Following the same process as the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
