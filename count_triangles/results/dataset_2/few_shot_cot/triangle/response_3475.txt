Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.
    * Pair 7: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.
    * Pair 8: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 6: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 7: (14, 3) -> 14 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for Nodes 3, 4, 5, and so on, we find all the triangles in the graph. Finally, we calculate the total number of triangles.

[Total number of triangles in the graph: 9]
[Unique triangles: <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 13>, <1, 6, 4>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 3>, <4, 13, 8>, <4, 13, 0>, <5, 8, 10>]
