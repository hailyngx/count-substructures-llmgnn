Response:
Continuing the process as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (0, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as they are not part of any triangle due to a lack of available nodes larger than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
