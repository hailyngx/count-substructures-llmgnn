Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are connected through Node 4. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected through Node 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and beyond:
    * Nodes 8, 9, 10, and onwards do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.
  
Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
