Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 22) - Both 16 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 16 and 22 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) - Both 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 22) - Both 1 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (16, 29) - Both 16 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 21) - Both 16 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (25, 1) - Both 25 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) - Both 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 25) - Both 6 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 26) - Both 6 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 21) - Both 7 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing the same process for Nodes 11 to 29:

* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 1 triangle
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 1 triangle
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 1 triangle
* Node 17: 1 triangle
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 1 triangle
* Node 22: 1 triangle
* Node 23: 0 triangles
* Node 24: 1 triangle
* Node 25: 1 triangle
* Node 26: 2 triangles
* Node 27: 0 triangles
* Node 28: 1 triangle
* Node 29: 1 triangle
