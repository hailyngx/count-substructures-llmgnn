Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) - Both 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 0 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 0) - Both 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) - Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 1 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) - Both 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) - Both 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) - Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles is [9].
