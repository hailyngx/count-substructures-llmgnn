Response:
Applying the process described in the example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 14 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 12 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 11 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 12 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 8 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> Both 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 7 are directly connected as (8, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 14 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 11 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 12 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

The remaining nodes like 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 need to be evaluated in a similar manner to count the triangles.
