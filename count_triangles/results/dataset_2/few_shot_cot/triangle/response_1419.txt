Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <0, 4, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <1, 4, 3>
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <1, 3, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <1, 2, 7>
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 3, 13>
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip other nodes with a smaller number than 4.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 5, 8>
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8: <6, 8, 12>
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip other nodes with a smaller number than 7.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip other nodes with a smaller number than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip nodes with a smaller number than 11.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip nodes with a smaller number than 12.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip nodes with a smaller number than 13.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 6

Therefore, the answer is [6].
