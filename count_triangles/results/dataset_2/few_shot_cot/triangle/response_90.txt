Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 20) -> 9 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 21) -> 9 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 21) -> 20 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (22, 28) -> 22 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 29) -> 22 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 8) -> 22 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (28, 29) -> 28 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (28, 8) -> 28 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (29, 8) -> 29 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * similar to e.g. (13, 17), (13, 7), (13, 4), (17, 7), (17, 4), (7, 4): no triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * List all possible pairs involving Node 3 e.g. (6, 24), (6, 16), (24, 16): no triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Please proceed as demonstrated above to find the total number of triangles in the given graph.
