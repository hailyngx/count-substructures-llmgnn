Response:
Following the previous example to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (4, 12) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 4: (4, 6) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 5: (4, 13) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 6: (8, 12) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 7: (8, 5) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 8: (8, 6) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 9: (8, 13) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 10: (12, 5) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 11: (12, 6) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 12: (12, 13) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 13: (5, 6) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 14: (5, 13) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 15: (6, 13) - Not a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 11) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (6, 13) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (6, 9) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 4: (11, 13) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 5: (11, 9) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 6: (13, 9) - Not a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skipped because there aren't any pairs with larger nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 10) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (5, 2) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (5, 11) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 4: (10, 2) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 5: (10, 11) - Not a triangle.
    - Pair 6: (2, 11) - Not a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (8, 14) - Not a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 do not have enough other nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
