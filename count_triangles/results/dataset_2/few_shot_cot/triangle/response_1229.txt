    * Pair 6: (5, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0


* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2


* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1


* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1


* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0


* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 9 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1


* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0


* Node 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
