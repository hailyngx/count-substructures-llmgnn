Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example using the adjacency list and edge list provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> Not forming a triangle as 4 and 17 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 18) -> Not forming a triangle as 4 and 18 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (17, 18) -> Forming a triangle <0, 17, 18>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Not forming a triangle as 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Forming a triangle <1, 2, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Not forming a triangle as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Forming a triangle <1, 2, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Not forming a triangle as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Not forming a triangle as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> Forming a triangle <3, 4, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Not forming a triangle as 4 and 13 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (10, 13) -> Not forming a triangle as 10 and 13 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Forming a triangle <3, 4, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Not forming a triangle as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, and 10:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Not forming a triangle as 4 and 14 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> Forming a triangle <15, 17, 18>.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these.

Summarizing the triangles: [1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 15) = 5]

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles found are <0, 17, 18>, <1, 2, 8>, <3, 4, 10>, and <15, 17, 18>.
