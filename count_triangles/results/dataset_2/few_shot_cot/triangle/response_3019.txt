Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example for each node in the graph, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 22) -> 7 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 22 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 28) -> 6 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 28 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 23) -> 14 and 23 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 because (14, 23) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 because (14, 19) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0
