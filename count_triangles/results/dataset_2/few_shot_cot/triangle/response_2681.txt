Response:
Following the steps provided in the initial example, let's count the triangles in the given graph based on each node:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (7, 22) -> 7 and 22 are directly connected. No other nodes to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (6, 23) -> 6 and 23 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (15, 25) -> 15 and 25 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No pairs to form a triangle with Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - No pairs to form a triangle with Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (13, 28) -> 13 and 28 are directly connected. No other nodes to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (5, 23) -> 5 and 23 are directly connected. No other nodes to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No pairs to form a triangle with Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No pairs to form a triangle with Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    - No pairs to form triangles as there are no nodes greater than these.

- Node 15:
    - Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (27, 29) -> 27 and 29 are directly connected. No other nodes to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20:
    - No pairs to form triangles as there are no nodes greater than these.

- Node 21:
    - Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No pairs to form a triangle with Node 21.
    - Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
    - No pairs to form triangles as there are no nodes greater than these.
