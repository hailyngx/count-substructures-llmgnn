Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
   - Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 4: (1, 2) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 5: (7, 6) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 7: (7, 2) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 8: (6, 9) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 9: (6, 2) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 10: (9, 2) -> Not a triangle
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
   - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 3: (6, 2) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 4: (7, 9) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 5: (7, 2) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 6: (9, 2) -> Not a triangle
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
   - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 2: (4, 3) -> Not a triangle
   - Pair 3: (8, 3) -> Not a triangle
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
   - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Not a triangle
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
   - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Not a triangle
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. Node 6:
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8:
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
