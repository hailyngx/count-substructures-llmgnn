Response:
Following the same method outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 20) - Both are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) - Both are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 2) - Both are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pairs: Skipped due to smaller numbered nodes having been previously evaluated.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs: Skipped due to smaller numbered nodes having been previously evaluated.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs: No triangles can be formed with larger nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs: Skipped due to smaller numbered nodes having been previously evaluated.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pairs: No triangles can be formed with larger nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pairs: No triangles can be formed with larger nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pairs: No triangles can be formed with larger nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pairs: Skipped due to smaller numbered nodes having been previously evaluated.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pairs: Skipped due to smaller numbered nodes having been previously evaluated.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 29: Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than those numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

[<0, 8, 20>, <0, 8, 2>, <4, 20, 2>]
