Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> Both 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> Both 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 11) -> Both 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 11>
    * Pair 5: (5, 11) -> Both 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> Both 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> Both 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Both 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 13) -> Both 14 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 13, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <6, 7, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 2, 11>, <3, 13, 14>]
