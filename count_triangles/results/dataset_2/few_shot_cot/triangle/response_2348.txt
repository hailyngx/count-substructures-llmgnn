Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) - 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 11) - 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 12) - 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 10) - 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 11) - 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (7, 12) - 7 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (10, 11) - 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) - 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) - 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 13) - 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (12, 13) - 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) - 7 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) - 7 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) - 12 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes. No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
