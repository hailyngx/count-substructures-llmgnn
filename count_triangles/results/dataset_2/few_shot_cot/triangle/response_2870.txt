Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph, we can determine the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * No connections, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are connected, not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (19, 21) -> 19 and 21 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 21) -> 17 and 21 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (23, 15) -> 23 and 15 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (23, 28) -> 23 and 28 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (23, 10) -> 23 and 10 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no other connected nodes.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no other connected nodes.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (14, 27) -> 14 and 27 are connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (23, 19) -> 23 and 19 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (23, 28) -> 23 and 28 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (25, 17) -> 25 and 17 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connected nodes greater than these nodes.

* Node 20:
    * Pair 1: (15, 10) -> 15 and 10 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 21:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 22:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connected nodes greater than Node 22.

* Node 23:
    * Pair 1: (29, 20) -> 29 and 20 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 24:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connected nodes greater than Node 24.

* Nodes 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connected nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
