Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided for counting triangles in a graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 0) -> Node 13 is not directly connected to Node 0, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Pair 2: (10, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Node 4 is not directly connected to Node 9, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 10.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Pair 5: (14, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (14, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 9: (6, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (13, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 14.
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 6: (4, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (12, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 11.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Pair 5: (5, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 12.
    * Pair 6: (13, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Continuing with the same process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
Finally, calculating the total number of triangles in the graph.

[<8, 13, 0>, <10, 4, 9>, <5, 12, 10>, <11, 5, 8>, <11, 3, 6>, <8, 4, 14>, <8, 5, 11>]
