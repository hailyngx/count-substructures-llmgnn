Response:
Following the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node. 

Starting with Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 0.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed with Node 0.
    - Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle with Node 0.
    - Pair 5: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle with Node 0.
    - Pair 6: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing with the rest of the nodes:
    - Node 1: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 2: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 3: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 4: Total triangles = 2
    - Node 5: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 6: Total triangles = 1
    - Node 7: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 8: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 9: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 10: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 11: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 12: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 13: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 14: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 15: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 16: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 17: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 18: Total triangles = 0
    - Node 19: Total triangles = 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) 
Total triangles in the graph = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
