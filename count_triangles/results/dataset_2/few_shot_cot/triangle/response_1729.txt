Response:
Following the step-by-step approach mentioned in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (triangles: <2, 8, 18>, <2, 8, 14>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs can be considered for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (triangle: <3, 8, 14>)

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs can be considered for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (triangle: <4, 11, 19>)

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

* Node 15:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 15.

* Node 16:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 16.

* Node 17:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 17.

* Node 18:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 18.

* Node 19:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph:  4

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
