Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (5, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (7, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

This process will be continued for Nodes 5 through 14 until all nodes have been considered. 

After calculating the triangles for each node and summing them up, the final answer will be the total number of triangles formed in the graph.
