Response:
Following the same method demonstrated in the example, I will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 28) -> Node 4 and Node 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (19, 28) -> Node 19 and Node 28 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Node 5 and Node 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 27) -> Node 13 and Node 27 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 27) -> Node 13 and Node 27 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 16) -> Node 13 and Node 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 12) -> Node 13 and Node 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 20) -> Node 9 and Node 20 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No connections to form any triangles with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Skipping Node 11 as it only has one connection (to Node 9) which is already accounted for.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Calculating the total number of triangles by adding the counts together:
Total triangles = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
