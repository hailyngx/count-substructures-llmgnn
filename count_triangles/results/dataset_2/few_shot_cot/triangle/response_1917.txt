Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (0, 4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (1, 2, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (0, 5, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 8 are also connected as (0, 4, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these remaining nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [4].
