Summarizing the triangles:  
Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1  
Total triangles in the graph = 8  

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.  
  
The unique triangles are:  
<9, 1, 10>  
<5, 9, 13>  
<4, 5, 13>  
<6, 11, 12>  
<8, 10, 12>  
<1, 9, 13>  
<4, 12, 14>  
<3, 4, 14>  

So, the final answer is [8].
