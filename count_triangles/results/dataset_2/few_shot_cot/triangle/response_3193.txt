Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 5: (10, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 6: (10, 12) -> Connected, potential triangle with node 1 found.
    * Pair 7: (10, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 8: (12, 7) -> Connected, potential triangle with node 1 found.
    * Pair 9: (12, 2) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 10: (12, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 11: (12, 0) -> Connected, potential triangle with node 1 found.
    * Pair 12: (13, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> Connected, potential triangle with node 7 found.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> Connected, potential triangle with node 0 found.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> Connected, potential triangle with node 0 found.
    * Pair 5: (14, 10) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 6: (14, 12) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 7: (14, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 8: (10, 12) -> Connected, potential triangle with node 0 found.
    * Pair 9: (10, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> Connected, potential triangle with node 0 found.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (12, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip to avoid repetition.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip to avoid repetition.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as they have no pair of other nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are **7 triangles** in the given graph.

So, the answer would be: **[7]**.
