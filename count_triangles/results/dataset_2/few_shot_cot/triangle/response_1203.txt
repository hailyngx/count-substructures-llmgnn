Response:
Following the same method as described in the example above, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 0 or 1.
    * No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (18, 5) -> 18 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 10.
    * No triangle formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 11.
    * No triangle formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 12.
    * No triangle formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 13.
    * No triangle formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 14.
    * No triangle formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 15.
    * No triangle formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 16.
    * No triangle formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 17.
    * No triangle formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 18.
    * No triangle formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 19.
    * No triangle formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [2].
