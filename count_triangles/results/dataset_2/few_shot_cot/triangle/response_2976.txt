Response:
Following the same process as described in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 12. Triangle <4, 8, 12>.
    - Pair 2: (4, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 8. Triangle <4, 8, 12>.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 19. Triangle <1, 4, 19>.
    - Pair 2: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (16, 20) -> Triangle formed with Node 13. Triangle <2, 13, 16>.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (15, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (15, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (15, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 15. Triangle <4, 5, 15>.
    - Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 15. Triangle <4, 5, 15>.
    - Pair 3: (5, 24) -> No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (15, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (15, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 4. Triangle <4, 5, 15>.
    - Pair 3: (15, 24) -> No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (18, 24) -> Triangle formed with Node 25. Triangle <6, 18, 25>.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (4, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 12. Triangle <0, 4, 12>.
    - Pair 2: (0, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 14. Triangle <0, 10, 14>.
    - Pair 3: (0, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 4. Triangle <0, 4, 12>.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (15, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (15, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (15, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* For Nodes 10 to 29, no triangles can be formed as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
