Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> Connected as (4, 7). Both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed (<0, 4, 7>).
    * Pair 8: (4, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> Connected as (7, 9). Both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed (<0, 7, 9>).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Connected as (2, 3). Both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed (<1, 2, 3>).
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> Connected as (3, 7). Both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed (<1, 3, 7>).
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 7: (7, 9) -> Connected as (7, 9). Both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed (<1, 7, 9>).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Connected as (3, 5). Both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed (<2, 3, 5>).
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Connected as (3, 7). Both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed (<2, 3, 7>).
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Connected as (5, 7). Both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed (<2, 5, 7>).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Connected as (5, 7). Both are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed (<3, 5, 7>).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Connected as (7, 9). Both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed (<4, 7, 9>).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skipped pairs as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
