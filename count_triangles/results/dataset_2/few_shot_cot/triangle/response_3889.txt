Response:
Following the step-by-step approach, let's count the triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:

    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:

    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) - Both 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (6, 14) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles by adding up the triangles found for each node:

Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the answer is [11].
