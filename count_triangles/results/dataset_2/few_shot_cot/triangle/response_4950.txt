Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 2

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the previous answer, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 5), but since 3 and 5 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
