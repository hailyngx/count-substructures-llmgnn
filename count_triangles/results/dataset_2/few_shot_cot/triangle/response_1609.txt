Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 0 to form triangles.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Nodes 5 and 12 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Nodes 5 and 0 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * <1, 5, 12>, <1, 5, 0>

* Node 2:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 2 to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 3 to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 4 to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip as Node 5 has already been considered in the triangles formed with Node 1.

* Node 6:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 6 to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 7 to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 8 to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 9 to form triangles.

* Node 10:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 10 to form triangles.

* Node 11:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 11 to form triangles.

* Node 12:
    * Skip as Node 12 has already been considered in the triangles formed with Node 1.

* Node 13:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 13 to form triangles.

* Node 14:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 14 to form triangles.

* Node 15:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 15 to form triangles.

* Node 16:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 16 to form triangles.

* Node 17:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 17 to form triangles.

* Node 18:
    * Skip as there aren't enough nodes connected to Node 18 to form triangles.
