Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected. No third common neighbor found. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected. No third common neighbor found. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are connected. No third common neighbor found. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected. No third common neighbor found. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected. No third common neighbor found. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected. No third common neighbor found. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are connected. No third common neighbor found. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are connected. No third common neighbor found. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8 and Node 9:
        * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
