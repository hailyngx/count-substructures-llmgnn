Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 6: <0, 1, 12>.
  * Skip other pairs involving nodes smaller than 0.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <1, 2, 3>.
  * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <1, 4, 11>.
  * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 12: <0, 1, 12>.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs that involve Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 13: <2, 9, 13>.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 1: <1, 3, 4>.
  * Skip other pairs involving nodes smaller than 3.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 9: <8, 9, 14>.
  * Skip other pairs involving nodes smaller than 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
  * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 8: <8, 9, 14>.
  * Skip other pairs involving nodes smaller than 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are skipped as there aren't at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 12>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 9, 13>, <8, 9, 14>, and <0, 1, 12>.
