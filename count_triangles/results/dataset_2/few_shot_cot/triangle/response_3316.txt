Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph by considering each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 10 are also connected as (1, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 10 are also connected as (2, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 13 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 13 and 15 are also connected as (13, 15) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 12 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 5 are also connected as (9, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 22) -> 5 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 22 are also connected as (5, 22) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 4 are also connected as (9, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 29) -> 11 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 11 and 29 are also connected as (11, 29) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (18, 29) -> 18 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 18 and 29 are also connected as (18, 29) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (23, 29) -> 23 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but 23 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, we find:
    * Node 12: 0 triangles
    * Node 13: 0 triangles
    * Node 14: 0 triangles
    * Node 15: 0 triangles
    * Node 16: 0 triangles
    * Node 17: 0 triangles
    * Node 18: 0 triangles
    * Node 19: 0 triangles
    * Node 20: 0 triangles
    * Node 21: 0 triangles
    * Node 22: 0 triangles
    * Node 23: 0 triangles
    * Node 24: 0 triangles
    * Node 25: 0 triangles
    * Node 26: 0 triangles
    * Node 27: 0 triangles
    * Node 28: 0 triangles
    * Node 29: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
