Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 10 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 11:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 11 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 12:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 12 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 13:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 13 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 14:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 14 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 15:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 15 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 16:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 16 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 17:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 17 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 18, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 19 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
