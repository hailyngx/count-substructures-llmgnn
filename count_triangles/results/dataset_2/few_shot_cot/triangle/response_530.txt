Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
