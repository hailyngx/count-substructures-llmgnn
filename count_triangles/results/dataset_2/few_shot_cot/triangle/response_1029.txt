Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above for finding triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Not connected, triangle not formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Not connected, triangle not formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> Not connected, triangle not formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (8, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 3) -> Not connected, triangle not formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (7, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Not connected, triangle not formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Not connected, triangle not formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> Not connected, triangle not formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> Not connected, triangle not formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (9, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> Not connected, triangle not formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 11: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 12: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (8, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 13: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (8, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 14: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (7, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 15: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (7, 1) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 9

* Remaining nodes:
    * Node 2: Skipped
    * Node 3: Skipped
    * Node 4: Skipped
    * Node 5: Skipped
    * Node 6: Skipped
    * Node 7: Skipped
    * Node 8: Skipped
    * Node 9: Skipped

Summarizing the triangles counted:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 9 (Node 1) = 11.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
