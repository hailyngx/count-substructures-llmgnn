Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * ...
    (Continue this step for each node in the graph) â€¦

After counting triangles for all nodes, you will find a total count of triangles. Provide the final answer inside brackets [].
