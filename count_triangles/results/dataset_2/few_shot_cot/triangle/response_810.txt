Response:
Following the method described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> Both 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 14) -> Both 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs with at least 2 nodes greater than those nodes.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [11].
