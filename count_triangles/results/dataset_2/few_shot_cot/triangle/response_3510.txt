Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 19) -> Not connected.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 15) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (12, 15) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> Not connected.

    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> Not connected.

* Node 12:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than node 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18 and 19:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than node 18 or 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 and 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
