Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (9, 16) -> Both 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 9) and (0, 16).
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Both 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Both 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 14).
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (8, 3) and (3, 13).
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (16, 17) -> Both 16 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (16, 17).
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (1, 12) -> Both 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (1, 12).
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (8, 6) and (6, 14).
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (11, 1) -> Both 11 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (11, 1).
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (3, 13) -> Both 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (8, 3) and (3, 13).
    - Pair 2: (6, 14) -> Both 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (0, 16) -> Both 0 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (0, 16).
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (15, 10) -> Both 15 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Rest of the nodes do not form triangles with unique vertices satisfying the conditions. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 9, 16>, <2, 5, 14>, <3, 8, 13>, <4, 16, 17>, <5, 1, 12>, <6, 8, 14>, <7, 1, 11>, and <9, 0, 16>.
