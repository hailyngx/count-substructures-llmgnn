Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * There are no possible triangle formations involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2,  or 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * There are no possible triangle formations involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * There are no possible triangle formations involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * There are no possible triangle formations involving Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7.
    * Pair 1: (14, 9) -> 14 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * There are no possible triangle formations involving Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * There are no possible triangle formations involving Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * There are no possible triangle formations involving Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * There are no possible triangle formations involving Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].
