Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example with each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 7), but 5 and 7 are both smaller than 8, so this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
