Response:
Following the steps detailed in the example with the given information:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> Both 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 16) -> Both 3 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (3, 20) -> Both 3 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (3, 10) -> Both 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        
    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (15, 25) -> 15 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (6, 25) -> 6 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        
    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
        
    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2
        
Let's continue this process for Nodes 4 to 29.
