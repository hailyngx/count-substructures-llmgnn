Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 2 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip since Node 4 is not part of any triangle.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip since Node 6 is not part of any triangle.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
[<0, 7, 8>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 2>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 6, 2>, <3, 8, 9>].
