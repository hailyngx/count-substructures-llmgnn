Response:
Following the step-by-step process detailed in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) - Not a triangle as no third node connected to both 1 and 8.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) - Not a triangle as no third node connected to both 1 and 14.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) - Not a triangle as no third node connected to both 1 and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) - Not a triangle as no third node connected to both 6 and 5.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) - Not a triangle as no third node connected to both 6 and 4.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) - Not a triangle as no third node connected to both 6 and 0.
    * Pair 4: (6, 12) - Not a triangle as no third node connected to both 6 and 12.
    * Pair 5: (5, 4) - Not a triangle as no third node connected to both 5 and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) - Not a triangle as no third node connected to both 9 and 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 10) - Not a triangle as no third node connected to both 11 and 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) - Not a triangle as no third node connected to both 5 and 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) - Not a triangle as no third node connected to both 9 and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (10, 0) - Not a triangle as no third node connected to both 10 and 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9,  Node 10,  Node 11,  Node 12,  Node 13, and  Node 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
