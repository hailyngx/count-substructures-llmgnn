Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 25) -> 4 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 25 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 25) -> 6 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 20) -> Both 12 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 26) -> 4 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 26 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 24) -> 4 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 24) -> 26 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 26 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (0, 25) -> 0 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 25 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (22, 27) -> 22 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 22 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (19, 8) -> 19 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 to 29:
    * Skipping nodes 8 to 29 as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
[<0, 4, 25>, <2, 4, 26>, <7, 22, 27>]
