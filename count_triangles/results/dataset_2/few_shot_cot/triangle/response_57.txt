Response:
Great! Let's step through each node to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible pairs with 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible pairs with 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No possible pairs with 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible pairs with 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible pairs with 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible pairs with 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No possible pairs with 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Node 11 is not connected to any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No possible pairs with 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No possible pairs with 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No possible pairs with 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No possible pairs with 15 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Node 16 is not connected to any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No possible pairs with 17 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No possible pairs with 18 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No possible pairs with 19 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (All other nodes) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
