Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) - Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) - Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 12) - Both 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 2) - Both 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 2) - Both 12 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 12 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) - Both 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) - Both 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) - Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 10 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) - Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 10 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 0) - Both 10 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 10 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 14) - Both 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 10 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 14) - Both 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 11 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) - Both 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 11 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) - Both 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 6 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7:
    * Skipped due to being smaller than nodes processed already.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) - Both 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 12 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9 and 10:
    * Skipped as they are smaller than nodes processed already.

* Nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are: 
<4, 9, 12>, <1, 2, 3>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 11>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
