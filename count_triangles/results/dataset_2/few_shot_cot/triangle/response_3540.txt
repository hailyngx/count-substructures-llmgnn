Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 as the final node: <0, 2, 6>
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11 as the final node: <0, 2, 7>
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11 as the final node: <0, 2, 12>
    * Pair 4: (2, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (12, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2  (Triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the final node: <2, 7, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1  (Triangles: <0, 2, 12>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the final node: <5, 6, 9>
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1  (Triangles: <5, 6, 9>)

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7 through 14: 
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Nodes 7-14) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
