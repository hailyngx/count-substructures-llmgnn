Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (0, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (1, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (2, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (0, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Both 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (0, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Both 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (0, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
