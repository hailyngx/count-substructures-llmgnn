Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - <6, 8, 9> forms a triangle because 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as per the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - <4, 8, 1> forms a triangle because 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as per the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - <6, 9, 2> forms a triangle because 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as per the edge list.
    - <4, 8, 2> forms a triangle because 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as per the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node: 2

4. Node 3:
    - <1, 5, 3> forms a triangle because 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as per the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - <1, 8, 4> forms a triangle because 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as per the edge list.
    - <0, 9, 4> forms a triangle because 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as per the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node: 2

6. Node 5:
    - <0, 6, 5> forms a triangle because 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as per the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node: 1

7. Node 6:
    - <0, 8, 6> forms a triangle because 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as per the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - <0, 6, 8> forms a triangle because 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as per the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest node: 1

10. Node 9:
    - <0, 6, 9> forms a triangle because 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as per the edge list.
    - <1, 4, 9> forms a triangle because 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as per the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
