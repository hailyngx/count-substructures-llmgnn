Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (15, 4) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (15, 12) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (0, 4) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 7) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs possible as there are no two other nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (17, 0) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs possible as there are no two other nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (17, 14) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (17, 10) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (14, 10) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (17, 12) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (15, 12) -> Not a triangle as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 11 to 19, we find no triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
