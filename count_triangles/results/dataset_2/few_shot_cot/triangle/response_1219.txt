Response:
Following the same method as given in the example above, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph:  

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> Triangle with Node 0, 11, 19 formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> Triangle with Node 1, 11, 19 formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 19) -> Triangle with Node 1, 12, 19 formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Triangle with Node 2, 4, 11 formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> Triangle with Node 2, 9, 18 formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 16) -> Triangle with Node 2, 9, 16 formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 2) -> Triangle with Node 3, 13, 2 formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 12) -> Triangle with Node 3, 15, 12 formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 2) -> Triangle with Node 4, 11, 2 formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> Triangle with Node 5, 7, 15 formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> Triangle with Node 5, 7, 6 formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 1) -> Triangle with Node 5, 19, 1 formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> Triangle with Node 6, 7, 15 formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 12) -> Triangle with Node 7, 15, 12 formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> Triangle with Node 7, 5, 19 formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> Triangle with Node 8, 11, 4 formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> Triangle with Node 8, 11, 19 formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 9) -> Triangle with Node 8, 18, 9 formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (18, 2) -> Triangle with Node 9, 18, 2 formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 16) -> Triangle with Node 9, 18, 16 formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Triangle with Node 10, 3, 8 formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 21.

Therefore, there are 21 triangles in the given graph.
