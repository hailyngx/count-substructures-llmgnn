Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not directly connected although they are 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it has only one connection.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [5].
