Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 7), but since 4 is smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is the number of unique triangles in the given graph is [1].
