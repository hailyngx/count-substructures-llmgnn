Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Connected via edge (1, 3).
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Connected via edge (1, 2).
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Connected via edge (1, 7).
    * Pair 4: (3, 2) -> Connected via edge (3, 2).
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (2, 5) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (2, 7) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with 0, as it's smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with 0 and 1, as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Connected via edge (6, 7).
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with 0, as it's smaller.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Connected via edge (5, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with 0, 1, and 2, as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Connected via edge (6, 7).
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Connected via edge (3, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Cannot form triangles as they have fewer than 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
