Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will now find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected.
    * No more pairs involving Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are directly connected.
    * No more pairs involving Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as they are connected to nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected.
    * No more pairs involving Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they are connected to nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are directly connected.
    * No more pairs involving Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are directly connected.
    * No more pairs involving Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are directly connected.
    * No more pairs involving Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are directly connected.
    * No more pairs involving Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 17.

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [17].
