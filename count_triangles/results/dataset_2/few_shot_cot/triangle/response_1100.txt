Response:
Following the method shown in the example, we will count the triangles by examining every node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) - 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) - 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) - 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) - 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) - 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) - Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) - Both 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) - Both 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one remaining node that is larger than each of these nodes. No further calculations needed.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) - Both 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) - 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) - Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) - Both 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) - Both 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <5, 8, 12>, <4, 9, 14>, <4, 11, 12>, <9, 11, 14>. 

The final answer is [8].
