Response:
Following the same process described in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because there is no edge connecting them in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 4 connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> Both 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed. <6, 14, 17>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 7 connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 9 connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed. <10, 15, 19>
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19: 
    * Skipped as each of these nodes does not have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
