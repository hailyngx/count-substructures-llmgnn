Response:
Following the same method shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 5 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 5 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 5 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 5 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 5 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 2 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 5 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 2 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 6: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 6 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9 are skipped as there are no pairs of nodes numbering greater than them for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
