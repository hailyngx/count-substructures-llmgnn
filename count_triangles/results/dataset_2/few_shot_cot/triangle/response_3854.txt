Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
   * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 3: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
   * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
   * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
   * Pair 1: (10, 7) -> 10 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. 
   * No more possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
   * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 3:
   * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. 
   * No more possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
   * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 5:
   * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. 
   * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected.
   * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. 
   * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. 
   * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
   * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 7:
   * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. 
   * No more possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
   * Pair 1: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected.
   * Pair 2: (10, 0) -> 10 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected.
   * No more possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
   * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. 
   * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected.
   * No more possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
   * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 11:
   * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 12:
   * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 13:
   * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 14:
   * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
