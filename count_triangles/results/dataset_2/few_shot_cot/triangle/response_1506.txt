Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. They form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 4. They form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of node 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (15, 8) -> 15 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of node 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of node 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 7. They form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (16, 13) -> 16 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (15, 2) -> 15 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 10) -> 15 and 10 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes...

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [3].
