Response:
Following the same method as in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (10, 7) -> 10 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as they include nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as they include nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 6, 4>.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 3, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 3, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Continuing this process for Nodes 5 to 14:

    * Node 5: 0 triangles found.
    * Node 6: 0 triangles found.
    * Node 7: 0 triangles found.
    * Node 8: 0 triangles found.
    * Node 9: 0 triangles found.
    * Node 10: 0 triangles found.
    * Node 11: 0 triangles found.
    * Node 12: 0 triangles found.
    * Node 13: 0 triangles found.
    * Node 14: 0 triangles found.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
