Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected, forming a triangle.
    * No other triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly.
    * No other triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected.
    * No other triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected.
    * No other triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles with Node 9.

After examining all the nodes, we have found the following triangles:
[<2, 7, 17>, <4, 0, 2>, <10, 1, 11>, <12, 6, 16>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
