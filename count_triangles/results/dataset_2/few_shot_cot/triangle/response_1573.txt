Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest node: <0, 1, 2>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest node: <1, 3, 9>
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest node: <0, 1, 8>

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest node: <2, 4, 9>
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest node: <0, 2, 5>
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest node: <2, 4, 5>
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest node: <2, 7, 9>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest node: <3, 4, 9>
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest node: <1, 3, 8>

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest node: <2, 4, 9>
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest node: <2, 4, 5>
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest node: <3, 4, 8>
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest node: <4, 6, 7>

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest node: <5, 6, 7>
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest node: <2, 5, 8>

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest node: <3, 4, 6>
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest node: <5, 6, 7>

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest node: <2, 7, 9>

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest node: <1, 3, 8>
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest node: <1, 4, 8>
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest node: <2, 5, 8>

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest node: <1, 3, 9>
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest node: <2, 4, 9>

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 23

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [23].
