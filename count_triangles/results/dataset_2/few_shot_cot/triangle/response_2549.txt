Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> No 1-hop connection between Node 4 and Node 2.
    * Pair 4: (4, 20) -> No 1-hop connection between Node 4 and Node 20.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <0, 5, 4>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 26) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (17, 23) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (26, 23) -> No 1-hop connection between Node 26 and Node 23.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <1, 26, 17>

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (14, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (14, 0) -> No 1-hop connection between Node 14 and Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (14, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 4: (14, 29) -> No 1-hop connection between Node 14 and Node 29.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles: <2, 12, 14>, <2, 14, 8>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> No 1-hop connection between Node 13 and Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (13, 18) -> No 1-hop connection between Node 13 and Node 18.
    * Pair 3: (13, 22) -> No 1-hop connection between Node 13 and Node 22.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> No 1-hop connection between Node 6 and Node 12.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <4, 0, 6>

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 5: 1 triangle
* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 1 triangle
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 1 triangle
* Node 16: 1 triangle
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 1 triangle
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 0 triangles
* Node 22: 0 triangles
* Node 23: 0 triangles
* Node 24: 0 triangles
* Node 25: 0 triangles
* Node 26: 0 triangles
* Node 27: 0 triangles
* Node 28: 0 triangles
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
[<0, 5, 4>, <1, 26, 17>, <2, 12, 14>, <2, 14, 8>, <4, 0, 6>, <5, 22, 0>, <12, 6, 4>, <15, 27, 12>, <16, 25, 18>]

There are 9 triangles in the given graph.
