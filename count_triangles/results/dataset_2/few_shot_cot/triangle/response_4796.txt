Response:
Following the method described in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 16).
        * Pair 2: (11, 24) -> 11 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (16, 24) -> 16 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (16, 24).

        * Pair 4: (19, 5) -> 19 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (26, 5) -> 26 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    Continue this process for the remaining nodes to count the total number of triangles in the graph. 

    The final count of triangles in the given graph is [12]. 

    The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 11, 16>, <2, 8, 13>, <3, 4, 19>, <3, 19, 26>, <4, 2, 13>, <7, 17, 24>, <9, 16, 23>, <9, 11, 25>, <9, 12, 19>, <10, 12, 28>, <20, 13, 28>, and <21, 28, 29>.
