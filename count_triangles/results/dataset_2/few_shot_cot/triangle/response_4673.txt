Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip, only connected with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected through Node 1, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are connected through Node 1, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are connected through Node 1, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip, only connected with Node 0 and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are connected through Node 4, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are connected through Node 4, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are connected through Node 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected through Node 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are connected through Node 6, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are connected through Node 6, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are connected through Node 7, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are connected through Node 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are connected through Node 7, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are connected through Node 7, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are connected through Node 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are connected through Node 7, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are connected through Node 7, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are connected through Node 7, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

This is the process of finding the triangles in the graph. I will now continue with the rest of the nodes.
