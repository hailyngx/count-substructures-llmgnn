Response:
Applying the same process as shown in the example for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
        * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.

        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.
