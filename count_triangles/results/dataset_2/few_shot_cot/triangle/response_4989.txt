Response:
Following the same approach as the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Skipped due to smaller nodes.
            * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Skipped due to smaller nodes.
            * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Skipped due to no direct connection.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Skipped due to smaller nodes.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Skipped due to no direct connection.
            * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Skipped due to no direct connection.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Skipped due to smaller nodes.
            * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> Skipped due to no direct connection.
            * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> Skipped due to smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Skipped due to smaller nodes.
            * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Skipped due to no direct connection.
            * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Skipped due to no direct connection.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Skipped due to no direct connection.
            * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Skipped due to no direct connection.
            * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> Skipped due to no direct connection.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Skipped due to no direct connection.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

        Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
