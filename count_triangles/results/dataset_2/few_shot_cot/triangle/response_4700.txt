Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) - 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) - 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (14, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    Unique triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 14>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) - 6 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) - 6 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) - 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (7, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 12) - 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (7, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 12) - 13 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    Unique triangles: <1, 7, 13>, <1, 7, 12>

* Node 2:
    * No valid triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) - 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) - 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) - 4 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 12) - 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    Unique triangles: <3, 4, 13>, <3, 4, 12>

* Node 4:
    * No valid triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) - 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (7, 14) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique triangles: <5, 7, 14>

* Node 6:
    * No valid triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) - 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (12, 14) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique triangles: <7, 12, 14>

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14: 
    No valid triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8-14) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 14>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 7, 12>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 4, 12>, <5, 7, 14>, <7, 12, 14>.
