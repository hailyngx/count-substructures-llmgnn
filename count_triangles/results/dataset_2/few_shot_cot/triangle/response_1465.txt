Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 13: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The process will continue for Nodes 6 to 14.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7].

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 
[<1, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 10>, <0, 5, 12>, <3, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 7>]
