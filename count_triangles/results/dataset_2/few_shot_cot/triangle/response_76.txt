Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (3, 5) edge is missing. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipping all pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping all pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 because (4, 13) edge is missing. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping all pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping all pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping all pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skipping the rest of the pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipping all pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Skipping the other pair as it involves a node smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skipping all pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skipping all pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skipping all pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skipping all pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skipping all pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
