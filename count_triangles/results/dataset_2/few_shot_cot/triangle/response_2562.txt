    - Pair 5: (1, 5) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 6: (7, 5) -> Connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <3, 9, 7>)

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 2: (9, 2) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 3: (9, 1) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 4: (6, 2) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 5: (6, 1) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 6: (2, 1) -> Connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <4, 2, 1>)

* Node 5:
    - There are no possible triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Connected.
    - Pair 2: (7, 5) -> Connected.
    - Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 4: (9, 5) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 5: (9, 8) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 6: (5, 8) -> Connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (Triangles <6, 7, 9>, <6, 5, 8>)

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Connected.
    - Pair 4: (9, 3) -> Connected.
    - Pair 5: (9, 6) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 6: (3, 6) -> Not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (Triangles <7, 5, 6>, <7, 9, 3>)

* Node 8:
    - There are no possible triangles involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    - There are no possible triangles involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
