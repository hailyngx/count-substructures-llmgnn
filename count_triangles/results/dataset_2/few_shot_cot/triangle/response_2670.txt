Response:
Following the same steps as the example provided:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 27) -> 4 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 5 and 0 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (23, 5) -> 23 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 23 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (23, 25) -> 23 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (25, 5) -> 25 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 25 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (23, 16) -> 23 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 23 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (23, 29) -> 23 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (23, 17) -> 23 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 16 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * The node only has one neighbor, so no triangles can be formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (7, 24) -> 7 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (7, 25) -> 7 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 25 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
             * Based on the provided adjacency lists and the available pairs (which have smaller numbered nodes), no triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Each for Nodes 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29) = 5.

        Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
