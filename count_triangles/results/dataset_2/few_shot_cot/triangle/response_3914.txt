Response:
Following the same methodology as explained in the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
