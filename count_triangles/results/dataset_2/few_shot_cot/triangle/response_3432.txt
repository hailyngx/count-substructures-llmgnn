Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
   - Pair 1: (6, 28) -> 6 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:**
   - Pair 1: (3, 20) -> 3 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (3, 23) -> 3 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 4: (20, 23) -> 20 and 23 are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 5: (20, 4) -> 20 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 6: (23, 4) -> 23 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**
   - Pairs involving Node 0 and Node 1 are skipped.
   - Pair 1: (4, 29) -> 4 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (29, 17) -> 29 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3:**
   - Pairs involving Node 0, 1, and 2 are skipped.
   - Pair 1: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4:**
   - Pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, and 3 are skipped.
   - Pair 1: (11, 29) -> 11 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (2, 29) -> 2 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 4: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 5: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

6. **Node 5:**
   - Pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are skipped.
   - Pair 1: (8, 28) -> 8 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (8, 20) -> 8 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 4: (28, 19) -> 28 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 5: (28, 20) -> 28 and 20 are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 6: (19, 20) -> 19 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

7. **Node 6:**
   - Pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are skipped.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
   - No valid pairs possible to form a triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Continuing the process for the remaining nodes:**
   - Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 - No valid pairs found to form a triangle.

Finally, summing up the triangles found for each node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8-29) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
