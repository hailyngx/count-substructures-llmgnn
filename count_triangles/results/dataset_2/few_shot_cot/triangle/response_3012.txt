Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 10 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.

    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (16, 14) -> 16 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5 because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 17, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (13, 15) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 as they are smaller than 18.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
