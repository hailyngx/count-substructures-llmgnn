Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, we can count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * <1, 13, 5> - Node 1 is connected to nodes 13 and 5, and nodes 13 and 5 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * <2, 17, 14> - Node 2 is connected to nodes 17 and 14, and nodes 17 and 14 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * <3, 8, 15> - Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 15, and nodes 8 and 15 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * <4, 10, 15> - Node 4 is connected to nodes 10 and 15, and nodes 10 and 15 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * <5, 13, 1> - Node 5 is connected to nodes 13 and 1, and nodes 13 and 1 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * <8, 15, 7> - Node 8 is connected to nodes 15 and 7, and nodes 15 and 7 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * <14, 17, 3> - Node 14 is connected to nodes 17 and 3, and nodes 17 and 3 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
