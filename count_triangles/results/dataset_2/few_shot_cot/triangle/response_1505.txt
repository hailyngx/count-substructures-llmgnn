Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (7, 6) - No triangle can be formed with node 0.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (4, 3) - No triangle can be formed with node 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (5, 3) - No triangle can be formed with node 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) - No triangle can be formed with node 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (11, 13) - No triangle can be formed with node 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 10:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
            * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 11:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 as they are smaller than 11.
            * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 12:
            * Pair 1: (6, 14) - No triangle can be formed with node 12.
            * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 13:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 as they are smaller than 13.
            * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 14:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13 as they are smaller than 14.
            * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

        Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
