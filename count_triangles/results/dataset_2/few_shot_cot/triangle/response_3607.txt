Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. (8, 19) forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. (13, 19) forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (15, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 9) -> 15 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (15, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (15, 18) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (16, 18) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. (3, 12) forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. (3, 5) forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. (5, 12) forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. (12, 15) forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Since Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes, there are no triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10 - Node 19:
    * Skipped because they are not part of any triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
[<3, 12, 15>, <3, 5, 12>, <8, 0, 19>, <13, 0, 19>, <3, 12, 2>, <3, 5, 2>]
