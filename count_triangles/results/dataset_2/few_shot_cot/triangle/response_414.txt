Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed since 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - No triangle formed since 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - No triangle formed since 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 6) - No triangle formed since 9 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) - No triangle formed since 9 and 8 are connected but not part of a triangle with node 0.
    * Pair 6: (1, 9) - No triangle formed since 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - No triangle formed since 9 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) - No triangle formed since 9 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) - No triangle formed since 6 and 2 are connected but not part of a triangle with node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) - No triangle formed since 5 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) - Triangle formed with node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 5, 3>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - No triangle formed since 5 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 3) - No triangle formed since 1 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (1, 6) - No triangle formed since 1 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Triangle formed with node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 5, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) - Triangle formed with node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 5, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed since 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes 0 to 4 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) - No triangle formed since 9 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - No triangle formed since 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes 0 to 8 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
