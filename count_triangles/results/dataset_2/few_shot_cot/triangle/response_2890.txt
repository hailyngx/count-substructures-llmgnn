Response:
Let's count the triangles in this graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 28) - 16 and 28 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 26) - 4 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) - 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) - 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (18, 25) - 18 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 29) - 18 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 2) - 18 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Proceeding in the same manner, we continue with Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, and so on until Nodes 28 and 29. Then sum up the total triangles for all nodes.

Finally, we provide the answer in brackets [] with the unique triangles found inside <> such as <0, 2, 4>. Let's proceed with the calculations.
