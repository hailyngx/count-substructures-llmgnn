Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 14) -> 16 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

 Continue the process for Nodes 5 to 19.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (18, 14) -> 18 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

 Summarizing the triangles:
 * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 13
 
 Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
