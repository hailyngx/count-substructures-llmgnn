Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 1) -> 15 and 1 are connected, but 15 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are connected and 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <15, 18, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (18, 15) -> 18 and 15 are connected, but 18 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (14, 5) -> 14 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. 14 and 5 are also 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <14, 5, 11>.

    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also directly connected. 1 and 15 are not otherwise connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is: [2].
