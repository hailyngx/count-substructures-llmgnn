Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 4).
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 4).
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 4).
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 4).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 9), but since 6 and 9 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5 as there are no other nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs of nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
