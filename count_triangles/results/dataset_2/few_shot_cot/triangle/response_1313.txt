Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 2, and node 8

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, Node 5, and Node 6:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs with larger nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
