Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (3, 10) - 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 12) - 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (10, 12) - 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (10, 9) - 10 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (12, 9) - 12 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (3, 13) - 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 13) - 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

3. **Node 2:**
    - Skipped as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 13) - 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (13, 1) - 13 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

5. **Node 4:**
    - Skipped as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
    - Pair 1: (6, 13) - 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (13, 6) - 13 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

7. **Node 6:**
    - Skipped as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    - Pair 1: (8, 11) - 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (11, 14) - 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (14, 9) - 14 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

9. **Node 8:**
    - Skipped as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - Skipped as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
[<3, 10, 0>, <3, 12, 0>, <3, 13, 1>, <5, 13, 1>, <3, 4, 1>, <5, 6, 3>, <5, 7, 3>, <6, 13, 3>, <6, 5, 13>, <8, 11, 7>, <11, 14, 7>, <11, 8, 14>]. 

Therefore, the answer is [12].
