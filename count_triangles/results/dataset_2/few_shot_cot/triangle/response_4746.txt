Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
