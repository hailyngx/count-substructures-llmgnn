Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Following the same process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 1 triangle
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 0 triangles

Final count:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
