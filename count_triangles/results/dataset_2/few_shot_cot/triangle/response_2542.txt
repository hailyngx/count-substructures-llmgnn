Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Triangle formed with Node 0, 2, and 5.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) - Triangle formed with Node 0, 2, and 12.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) - Triangle formed with Node 0, 2, and 13.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 3) - Triangle formed with Node 0, 5, and 3.
    * Pair 9: (5, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (12, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (12, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (12, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (13, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (13, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (3, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - Triangle formed with Node 1, 4, and 9.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Not enough nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.
    
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
