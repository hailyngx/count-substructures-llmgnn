Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (11, 18) -> Connected to both nodes. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (18, 8) -> Connected to both nodes. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. **Node 2:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
   
4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (10, 5) -> Connected to both nodes. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4:**
    - Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Connected to both nodes. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 5) -> Connected to both nodes. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. **Node 5:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (12, 2) -> Connected to both nodes. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. **Node 6:**
    - Pair 1: (13, 7) -> Connected to both nodes. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. **Node 7:**
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
    - Pair 1: (1, 19) -> Connected to both nodes. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. **Node 9:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. **Node 10:**
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. **Node 11:**
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. **Node 12:**
    - Pair 1: (13, 19) -> Connected to both nodes. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

14. **Node 13:**
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. **Node 14:**
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

16. **Node 15:**
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

17. **Node 16:**
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

18. **Node 17:**
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

19. **Node 18:**
    - Pair 1: (3, 17) -> Connected to both nodes. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

20. **Node 19:**
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Adding up all the triangles calculated from each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 9.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 11, 18>, <1, 18, 8>, <10, 5, 3>, <6, 13, 4>, <6, 5, 4>, <12, 2, 5>, <13, 7, 6>, <1, 19, 8>, <3, 17, 18>.
