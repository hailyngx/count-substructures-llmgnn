Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) - Skipped as they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) - Skipped as they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 17) - Skipped as they involve smaller nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 1: (16, 19) - Skipped as they involve smaller nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Since Node 15 is only connected to Node 16 and Node 12, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) - Skipped as they involve smaller nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) - Skipped as they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Since Node 18 is only connected to Node 4, Node 19, and itself, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 19:
    * Since Node 19 is connected to Node 8, Node 18, Node 13, and Node 14, no triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
