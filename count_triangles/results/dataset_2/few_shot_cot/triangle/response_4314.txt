Response:
Following the same step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 17) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 25) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 28) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 2 to 29.

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (13, 21) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (13, 2) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (13, 28) -> Triangle formed: <2, 13, 28>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 23) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Proceed through the rest of the nodes, and calculate the total number of triangles formed:

* Total triangles in the graph = Sum of triangles formed by each node.
* Total number of triangles = Total triangles with Node 0 + Total triangles with Node 1 + Total triangles with Node 2 + ... + Total triangles with Node 29
* Finally, provide the total number of triangles in the graph inside brackets [] along with the unique triangles found in the format <node1, node2, node3>.
