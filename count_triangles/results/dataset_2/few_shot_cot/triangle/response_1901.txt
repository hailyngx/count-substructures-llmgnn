Response:
Following the step-by-step approach to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving Node 0 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph: 

Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
