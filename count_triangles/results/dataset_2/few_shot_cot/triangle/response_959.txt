Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 27) -> 13 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (13, 27) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (13, 18) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Since there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 in the given graph, there are no triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node.

* Continue this process for all other nodes in the graph to count the total number of triangles.

Continuing this process for all nodes, we find the following total triangles:

[<0, 13, 27>, <0, 18, 13>, <0, 18, 27>, <0, 18, 7>, <0, 27, 5>, <7, 9, 12>, <9, 19, 3>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
