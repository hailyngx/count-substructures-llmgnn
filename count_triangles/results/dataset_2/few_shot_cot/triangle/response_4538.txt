Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 1 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipping these nodes as there are no pairs with at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
