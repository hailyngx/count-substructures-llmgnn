Response:
Following the same method as described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangles formed: <0, 2, 8> and <0, 2, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 9, 13>
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 0.
    * Skip any other pair with smaller nodes than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * The only pair could consider is (3, 12), which is skipped as 3 is smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected; no new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 8, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs as all potential combinations contain nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11 and are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 11, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 12), but since 3 is smaller than 12, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No pairs can be formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
