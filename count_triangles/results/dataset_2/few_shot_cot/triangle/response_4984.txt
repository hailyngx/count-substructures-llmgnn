Response:
Following the same methodology as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1**:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2**:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3**:
    - Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4**:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5**:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6**:
    - No nodes to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. **Node 8**:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9**:
    - Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. **Node 10**:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. **Node 11**:
    - No nodes to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. **Node 12**:
    - No nodes to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. **Node 13**:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 as they are smaller than 13.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. **Node 14**:
    - No nodes to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

16. **Node 15**:
    - No nodes to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

17. **Node 16**:
    - No nodes to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

18. **Node 17**:
    - No nodes to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

19. **Node 18**:
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 18, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

20. **Node 19**:
    - No nodes to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:

\[1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0\]

\[= 4\]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:

\[<0, 4, 18>, <3, 10, 13>, <4, 7, 10>, <9, 13, 19>\]
