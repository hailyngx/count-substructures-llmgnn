Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 11 and 14 are also connected as (11, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 22) -> 11 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 11 and 8 are also connected as (11, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (14, 22) -> 14 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 22 are also connected as (14, 22) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs left to check. Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 27) -> 7 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs left to check. Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Please proceed in this manner to count the triangles for all the nodes and then sum up the total number of triangles at the end. Once you have completed the process for all nodes, please submit the final answer inside brackets.
