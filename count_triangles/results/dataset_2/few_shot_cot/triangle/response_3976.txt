Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 16 are also connected as (7, 16) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 16 are also connected as (3, 16) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 2 to form triangles with.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are directly connected, but 7 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 8 and 13 are also connected as (8, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 13 and 16 are also connected as (13, 16) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are directly connected, but 7 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are directly connected, but 9 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are directly connected, but 9 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 13 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's continue with Nodes 8 through 19:

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 10. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 11. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 15. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 16 to form triangles with.

* Node 17:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 17 to form triangles with.

* Node 18:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 18 to form triangles with.

* Node 19:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 19 to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [4].
