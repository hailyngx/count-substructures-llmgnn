Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip triangles with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (0, 14) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>
    * Pair 5: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (8, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip triangles with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Triangle formed: <5, 9, 10>
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> Triangle formed: <4, 5, 9>
    * Pair 5: (10, 11) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (10, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip triangles with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (10, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (10, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip triangles with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (13, 11) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (13, 12) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 5

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
