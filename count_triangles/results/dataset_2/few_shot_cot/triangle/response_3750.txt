Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (13, 19) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
<0, 13, 19>

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 1 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
<3, 13, 14>

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
<7, 13, 14>

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 10 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are also directly connected as (5, 15) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1
<5, 11, 15>

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 13 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 15 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 16 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 17 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 18 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 19 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 11) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
