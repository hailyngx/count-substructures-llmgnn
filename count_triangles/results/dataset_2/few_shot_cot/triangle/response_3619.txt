Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 7

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * All these nodes have no triangles with two larger numbered nodes, so they are skipped.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 7 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 15

Therefore, there are [15] triangles in the given graph.
