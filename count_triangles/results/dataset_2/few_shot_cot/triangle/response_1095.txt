Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we'll calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 4: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (4, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

6. Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

8. Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (8, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

10. Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
