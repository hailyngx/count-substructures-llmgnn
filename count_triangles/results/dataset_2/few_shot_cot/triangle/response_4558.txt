Response:
Following the method provided in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
