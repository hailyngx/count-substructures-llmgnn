Response:
Following the step-by-step process just like in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:  
   * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed since 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and directly connected.
   * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Triangle formed since 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and directly connected.
   * Pair 4: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 5: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:  
   * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed since 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and directly connected.
   * Pair 4: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:  
   * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Triangle formed since 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and directly connected.
   * Pair 2: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 3: (14, 4) -> Triangle formed since 14 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and directly connected.
   * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. Node 3:  
   * Pair 1: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 2: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed since 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and directly connected.
   * Pair 4: (10, 8) -> Triangle formed since 10 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and directly connected.
   * Pair 5: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. Node 4:  
   * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than 4.
   * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:  
   * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than 5.
   * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Nodes 6 to 14:  
   * Skipped as they do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
