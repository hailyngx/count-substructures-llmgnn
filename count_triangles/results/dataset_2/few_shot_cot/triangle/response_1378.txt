Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (3, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (7, 2) -> Connected as (7, 2). No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 3) -> Connected as (7, 3). No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 13) -> Connected as (7, 13). No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller. No triangles formed.

- Node 3:
    - No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller. No triangles formed.

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - All other nodes are smaller, so no triangles formed.

- Node 6:
    - All other nodes are smaller, so no triangles formed.

- Node 7:
    - No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller. No triangles formed.

- Node 8:
    - No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller. No triangles formed.

- Node 9:
    - No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller. No triangles formed.

- Node 10:
    - No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller. No triangles formed.

- Node 11:
    - No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller. No triangles formed.

- Node 12:
    - No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller. No triangles formed.

- Node 13:
    - No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller. No triangles formed.

- Node 14:
    - No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
