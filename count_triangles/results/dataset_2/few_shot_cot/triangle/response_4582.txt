Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0: Not connected to any other nodes. No triangles possible.

* Node 1:
    - <4, 6, 8>
    - <4, 15, 16>
    - <6, 8, 5>
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    - <9, 12, 13>
    - <13, 15, 16>
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - No triangles possible with the available connections.

* Node 4:
    - <7, 18, 16>
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - <6, 8, 1>
    - <5, 8, 6>
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    - <5, 8, 1>
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - <17, 14, 19>
    - <4, 18, 16>
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    - <5, 6, 1>
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - <12, 13, 9>
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    - These nodes do not form triangles with at least two nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
