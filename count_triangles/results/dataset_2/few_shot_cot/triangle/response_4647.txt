Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will now find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 0 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 6 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 6 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 2 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs or nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than any of these nodes to form triangles.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
