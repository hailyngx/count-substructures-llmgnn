Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7)

Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
Following the process mentioned before, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skipped because they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
