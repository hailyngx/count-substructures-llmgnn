Response:
Following the same process as in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 22) -> 15 and 22 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 0) -> 12 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Continue to Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
