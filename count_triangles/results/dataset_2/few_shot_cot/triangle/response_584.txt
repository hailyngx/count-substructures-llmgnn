Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Not connected as (9, 10) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> Not connected as (9, 11) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> Not connected as (9, 12) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 6) -> Not connected as (9, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Not connected as (9, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Not connected as (9, 10) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> Not connected as (9, 11) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> Not connected as (9, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 4) -> 13 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 13 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Not connected as (7, 10) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> Not connected as (7, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected as (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 12 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 4 are also connected as (9, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 9 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 9 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8:
    * Skipped as they require pairs with smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 4 are also connected as (5, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with larger numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
