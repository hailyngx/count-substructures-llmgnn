Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0)

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the same method as before, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 1 are also connected as (5, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 3 are also connected as (5, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 1 are also connected as (8, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 3 are also connected as (8, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 0 are also connected as (7, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are also directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 8 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 9 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * Skipped since they are not the smallest numbered nodes remaining.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
