Response:
Following the same process as the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 23) -> Both 11 and 23 are directly connected to 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 24) -> Both 7 and 24 are directly connected to 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 and Node 1 as they have smaller node labels.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (25, 8) -> Both 25 and 8 are directly connected to 3. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they have smaller node labels.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (26, 18) -> Both 26 and 18 are directly connected to 5. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (28, 23) -> Both 28 and 23 are directly connected to 6. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 6.

    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (18, 15) -> Both 18 and 15 are directly connected to 11. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (17, 22) -> Both 17 and 22 are directly connected to 12. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

* Node 15:

    * No triangles can be formed with Node 22.

* Node 23:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 23.

* Node 24:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 24.

* Node 25:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 25.

* Node 26:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 26.

* Node 27:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 27.

* Node 28:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 28.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph: [<0, 11, 23>, <1, 7, 24>, <3, 8, 25>, <5, 18, 26>, <6, 23, 28>, <12, 17, 22>]. 

The final answer is [6].
