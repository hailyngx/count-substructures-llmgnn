Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 25) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 25. <0, 1, 25>
    - Pair 2: (16, 25) -> 1-hop neighbors but not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 16) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 16. <0, 1, 16>
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 and Node 2. <0, 1, 2>
    - Pair 2: (0, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 and Node 14. <0, 1, 14>
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (12, 24) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12 and Node 24. <2, 12, 24>
    - Pair 2: (1, 24) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 24. <1, 2, 24>
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. Node 3:
    - The connectivity of Node 3 with other nodes does not form any triangles. Total: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (12, 28) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12 and Node 28. <4, 12, 28>
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11 and Node 17. <5, 11, 17>
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - No triangles formed with any of these nodes. Total: 0

8. Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (3, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 18. <3, 10, 18>
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (5, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 17. <5, 11, 17>
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (4, 28) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 28. <4, 12, 28>
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. Nodes 13, 14, and 15:
    - No triangles formed with any of these nodes. Total: 0

12. Node 16:
    - The connectivity of Node 16 with other nodes does not form any triangles. Total: 0

13. Node 17:
    - The connectivity of Node 17 with other nodes does not form any triangles. Total: 0

14. Node 18:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 9. <5, 9, 18>
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

15. Node 19:
    - The connectivity of Node 19 with other nodes does not form any triangles. Total: 0

16. Node 20:
    - Pair 1: (7, 21) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 and Node 21. <7, 20, 21>
    - Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 1

17. Node 21:
    - The connectivity of Node 21 with other nodes does not form any triangles. Total: 0

18. Node 22:
    - The connectivity of Node 22 with other nodes does not form any triangles. Total: 0

19. Nodes 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
    - No triangles formed with any of these nodes. Total: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0
Total triangles in the graph = 12

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
