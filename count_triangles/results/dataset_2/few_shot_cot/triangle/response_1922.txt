Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> Connected through Node 4. Next, check for a triangle:
        * (12, 0) -> Connected through Node 0. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 12>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Connected through Node 4. No third node connected to both 4 and 13.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> No triangle can be formed with these pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Connected through Node 3. Next, check for a triangle:
        * (5, 1) -> Connected through Node 1. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Connected through Node 3. No third node connected to both 3 and 8.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle can be formed with these pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Connected through Node 3. No third node connected to both 3 and 10.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Connected through Node 3. Next, check for a triangle:
        * (9, 2) -> Connected through Node 2. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> No triangle can be formed with these pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Connected through Node 1. Next, check for a triangle:
        * (5, 3) -> Connected through Node 5. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Connected through Node 1. No third node connected to both 1 and 8.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle can be formed with these pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Connected through Node 7. No third node connected to both 7 and 9.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> Connected through Node 7. No third node connected to both 7 and 12.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> No triangle can be formed with these pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Connected through Node 1. Next, check for a triangle:
        * (3, 5) -> Connected through Node 3. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> No triangle can be formed with these pairs.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> Connected through Node 3. No third node connected to both 3 and 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Connected through Node 7. No third node connected to both 7 and 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Connected through Node 11. No third node connected to both 11 and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than each to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
