Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, we will count the triangles in the provided graph by considering each node one by one:

Node 0:
    Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    Pair 2: (6, 12) - Both 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    Pair 3: (6, 3) - Both 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    Pair 4: (6, 1) - Both 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    Pair 5: (7, 12) - Both 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (7, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.

    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 1:
    Pair 1: (13, 11) - Both 13 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    Pair 2: (13, 4) - Both 13 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    Pair 3: (13, 5) - Both 13 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (13, 5) in the edge list.
    Pair 4: (13, 12) - Both 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    Pair 5: (13, 0) - Both 13 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.

    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 2 to 14, counting the triangles for each node:

Node 2:
    ...

Node 13:
    ...

Node 14:
    ...

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = ? (Node 0) + ? (Node 1) + ... + ? (Node 14) = ?.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [answer].
