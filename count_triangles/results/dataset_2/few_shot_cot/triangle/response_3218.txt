Response:
Following the provided instructions, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) - Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, 11, and 12:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least two nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) - Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.

    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
