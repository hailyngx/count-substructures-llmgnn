Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 20) -> 16 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (16, 20) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (16, 26) -> 16 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected as there is no edge (16, 26) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are not directly connected, as there is no edge (6, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 11) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 21) -> 9 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (9, 21) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (23, 4) -> 23 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (23, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of 7 that are directly connected.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of 8 that are directly connected.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 21) -> 4 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (4, 21) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
