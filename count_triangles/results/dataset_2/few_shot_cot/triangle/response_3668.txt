Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (20, 22) - Both 20 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (20, 22) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Skip other pairs that include Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) - Both 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skip other pairs that include Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 20) - Both 13 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (13, 20) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 29) - Both 13 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 29) - Both 19 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skip other pairs that include Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 22) - Both 3 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 22) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Skip other pairs that include Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 14 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 26, 11, or 7 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 or 24 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 24) - Both 9 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (9, 24) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) - Both 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 27) - Both 3 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Skip other pairs that include Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is smaller than 8. No triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 24) - Both 6 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (6, 24) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) - Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skip other pairs that include Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (1, 20) - Both 1 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected as (1, 20) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 29) - Both 1 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) - Both 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skip other pairs that include Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The analysis will continue for each remaining node in the graph to count the total number of triangles.
