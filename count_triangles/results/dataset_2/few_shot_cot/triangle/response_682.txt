Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the same step-by-step approach as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 7: (4, 10) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (4, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 10: (5, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 7: (5, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 8: (6, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 9: (6, 1) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (12, 14) -> Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (0, 13) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (0, 1) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (0, 5) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14.
    * Pair 7: (1, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 8: (4, 10) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (4, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 5

Now, continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8. Then summarize the total number of triangles in the graph.
