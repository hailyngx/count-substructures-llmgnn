Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided earlier, we will count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are directly connected. Finding the third node:
        * Pair 3: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Finding the third node:
        * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 8, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Finding the third node:
        * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 10, 11>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are directly connected. Finding the third node:
        * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Finding the third node:
        * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 8, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * No pairs to consider for these nodes as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
