Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected as (3, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not connected as (6, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are not connected as (6, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
