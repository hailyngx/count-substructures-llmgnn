Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by applying the step-by-step process for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 1:
    - <1, 4, 13> forms a triangle.

* Node 2:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 3:
    - <3, 4, 16> forms a triangle.

* Node 4:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 5:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 6:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 7:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 8:
    - <8, 3, 16> forms a triangle.

* Node 9:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 10:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 11:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 12:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 13:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 14:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 15:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 16:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 17:
    - <17, 1, 15> forms a triangle.
  
* Node 18:
    - Not in any triangles.

* Node 19:
    - Not in any triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 17) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
