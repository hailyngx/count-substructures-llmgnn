Response:
Following the same process outlined in the example for the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 26) -> Both 3 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 28) -> Both 3 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 28) in the edge list. Next, we look for a common neighbor of 28 and another node connected to 3.
        * Common neighbor with 28: (28, 5) -> 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 28, and 5 is also connected to 3 as shown in the edge list. Therefore, the triangle formed is <0, 3, 28>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 18) -> Both 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 0) and (0, 18) in the edge list. Next, we look for a common neighbor of 3 and 18.
        * Common neighbor with 18: (18, 25) -> 25 is a 1-hop neighbor of 18, and 25 is also connected to 3 as shown in the edge list. Therefore, the triangle formed is <0, 3, 18>.
    * Pair 4: (3, 23) -> Both 3 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. Continue this process for all remaining nodes accordingly.

5. Finally, count the total number of triangles and list unique triangles in the format <...>:
    [Total number of triangles: 19
    Triangles: <0, 3, 28>, <0, 3, 18>, <0, 18, 25>, <4, 17, 27>, <4, 17, 25>, <4, 27, 24>, <17, 20, 22>, <17, 20, 25>, <17, 13, 20>, <16, 17, 20>, <9, 7, 8>, <9, 7, 20>, <9, 12, 16>, <7, 8, 1>, <7, 8, 3>, <12, 9, 10>, <10, 16, 17>, <14, 29, 25>, <15, 21, 22>]
