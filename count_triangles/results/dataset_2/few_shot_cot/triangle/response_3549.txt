Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, here is the breakdown for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 (0, 6, 7).
    * Pair 2: (6, 23) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (18, 21) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes are available to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 (7, 9, 14).
    * Pair 2: (9, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 to 28 do not have enough larger nodes to form triangles.

* Node 29:
    * No other nodes are available to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 29) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 6, 7>, <7, 9, 14>]
