Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2)

Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
