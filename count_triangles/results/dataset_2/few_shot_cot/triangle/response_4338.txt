Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 21) -> 8 and 21 are not connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 2: (8, 29) -> 8 and 29 are not connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 3: (21, 29) -> 21 and 29 are not connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 2: (5, 24) -> 5 and 24 are not connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 3: (10, 24) -> 10 and 24 are not connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 27) -> 7 and 27 are not connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 2: (7, 20) -> 7 and 20 are not connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 3: (27, 20) -> 27 and 20 are not connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are not connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 2: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are not connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 3: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are not connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: No possible pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
    * None of these nodes have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node: 0 for each node

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + ... + 0 (Node 29) = 0

Therefore, [there are 0 triangles in the given graph].
