Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

1. Starting from Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Moving to Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Moving to Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Both 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangle found: <2, 4, 11>

4. Moving to Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (13, 16) -> Both 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Moving to Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Moving to Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Moving to Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Moving to Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Moving to Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Moving to Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Moving to Node 10:
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Moving to Node 11:
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. Moving to Node 12:
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Moving to Node 13:
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. Moving to Node 14:
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

16. Moving to Node 15:
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

17. Moving to Node 16:
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

18. Moving to Node 17:
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

19. Moving to Node 18:
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

20. Moving to Node 19:
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2)
- Unique triangles found: <2, 4, 11>

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, which is <2, 4, 11>.

The final answer is [1].
