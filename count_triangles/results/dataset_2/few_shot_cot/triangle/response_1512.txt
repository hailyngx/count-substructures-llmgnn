Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (2, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 16) -> Both 2 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Both 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Continue this process for the remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles...

After following the process for all nodes, the total number of triangles in the given graph is found to be [20]. 

Unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 2, 15>, <3, 11, 13>, <3, 13, 19>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 11, 15>, <6, 13, 5>, <11, 12, 17>, <12, 17, 18>, <15, 2, 4>, <15, 2, 14>.
