Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not connected as there is no edge (10, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are connected as (0, 15) is in the edge list and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 24) -> 10 and 24 are not connected as there is no edge (10, 24) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are connected as (14, 15) is in the edge list and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected as (1, 5) is in the edge list and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 25) -> 1 and 25 are connected as (1, 25) is in the edge list and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected as (1, 5) is in the edge list and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 5. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are connected as (5, 16) is in the edge list and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 5. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 23) -> 6 and 23 are connected as (6, 23) is in the edge list and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 6. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are connected as (7, 15) is in the edge list and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 7. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are connected as (10, 13) is in the edge list and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 10. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 22) -> 10 and 22 are connected as (10, 22) is in the edge list and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 10. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 2

We will continue this process for Nodes 11 to 29.
