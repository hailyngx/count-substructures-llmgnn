Response:
Following the same method as shown in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 1 and 11 as they are larger than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 15 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 29) -> 1 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are directly connected.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 8 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 15 and 22 as they are larger than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 23) -> 4 and 23 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * Since Node 19 is not connected to any other nodes, no triangles can be formed with Node 19.

* Node 20:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 21:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 22:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 23:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 24:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 25:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 26:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 27:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 28:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 29:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0
* Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
