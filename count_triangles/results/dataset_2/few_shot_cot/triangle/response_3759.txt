Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) - 7 and 13 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) - 10 and 14 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) - 10 and 11 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) - 10 and 12 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) - 15 and 16 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (15, 17) - 15 and 17 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (16, 17) - 16 and 17 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8: No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than them.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - 1 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) - 12 and 14 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19: No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
