Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 27) -> 13 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 24) -> 13 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (19, 24) -> 19 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (8, 21) -> 8 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 29) -> 8 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 29) -> 21 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 10) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
