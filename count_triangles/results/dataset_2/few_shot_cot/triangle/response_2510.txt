Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 10:
        * Pair 1: (18, 0) -> 18 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    Remaining nodes will be processed in a similar manner.
