Response:
Following the step-by-step method described in the previous example, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (28, 16) -> Both 28 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (28, 1) -> Both 28 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 1) -> Both 16 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (28, 14) -> 28 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 24) -> Both 3 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 21) -> 8 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Based on the calculations above, we can see that so far, we have found 2 triangles. Continuing this process for the remaining nodes until we cover all 30 nodes, we will then sum up the total triangles found.
