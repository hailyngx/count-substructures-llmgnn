Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 13) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 10) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (1, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (5, 13) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (0, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (6, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (10, 11) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (7, 10) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * No triangles with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
