Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<0, 4, 8>)

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to evaluate as there are not enough nodes greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for all nodes:

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to evaluate.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<3, 4, 17>, <3, 4, 19>)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8:
    * No triangles formed for these nodes following the same process as above.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<10, 19, 4>)

* Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node14:
    * No triangles formed for these nodes following the same process as above.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<11, 15, 18>)

* Node 16:
    * No triangles formed for this node following the same process as above.

* Node 17:
    * No pairs to evaluate.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18 and Node 19:
    * No triangles formed for these nodes following the same process as above.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
