Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Node 1 and Node 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected through (1, 2).
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Node 1 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> Node 1 and Node 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected through (1, 10).
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected through (2, 8).
    * Pair 5: (2, 10) -> Both 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected through (2, 10).
    * Pair 6: (8, 10) -> Both 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected through (8, 10).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 10>, <0, 2, 10>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> Both 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> Both 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 14) -> Node 9 and Node 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected through (9, 14).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (<1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 10>, <1, 8, 10>)

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Node 7 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> Node 7 and Node 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> Both 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 7, 8>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Node 5 and Node 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 5, 11>)

* Node 4:
    * All pairs with nodes smaller than 4 are avoided.
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 4.

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * Similar to Node 4, all triangles with these as the smallest numbered node yield 0.

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * For each of these nodes, there are no pairs that can form triangles with nodes greater than themselves.

Summing up the triangles found for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
