Response:
Following the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 1. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 3. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 5. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 7. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 8. No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 10. No triangle formed.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 14. No triangle formed.

* Node 15:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 15. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
