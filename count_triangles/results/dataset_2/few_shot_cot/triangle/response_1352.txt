Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: [<1, 4, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <8, 9, 2>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 2>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 1>].

The final answer is [8].
