Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, here is the calculation for the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are indirectly connected through 0. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are directly connected as (6, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no candidates greater than 1 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving 0, 1, or 3 are skipped as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are directly connected as (4, 19). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are indirectly connected through 5. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are directly connected as (5, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected as (5, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 0) -> 12 and 0 are directly connected as (12, 0). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are directly connected as (12, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (16, 9) -> 16 and 9 are directly connected as (16, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are directly connected as (16, 19). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no candidates greater than 3 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs involving 0, 1, or 2 are skipped as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are directly connected as (5, 19). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are directly connected as (2, 16). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5 (skipping pairs for 6, 7, 8, and 9) and 6 (skipping pairs for 7, 8, and 9) have no valid triangle combinations.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no candidates greater than 7 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are directly connected as (9, 19). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 17, 18, and 19 have no valid triangle combinations.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 6 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 10

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles found are: < 4, 5, 19>, < 2, 4, 16>, < 2, 5, 12>, < 5, 7, 12>, < 2, 12, 0>, < 16, 9, 19>, < 0, 6,12 >, < 5, 11, 7> and < 16, 9, 19> 
The final answer is [10].
