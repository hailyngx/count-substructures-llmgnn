Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 22) -> No connection. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 27) -> No connection. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 19) -> No connection. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (19, 22) -> Nodes 19 and 22 are connected and 19 and 22 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> No connection. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 19) -> Nodes 7 and 19 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> Nodes 11 and 16 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 26) -> No connection. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 21) -> No connection. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 21) -> No connection. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

Skipping the nodes with no triangles formed, the following can be calculated:

* Node 11: 
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13: 
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15: 
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16: 
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17: 
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18: 
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19: 
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 20: 
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 21: 
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 22: 
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 23: 
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 25: 
    * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 26: 
    * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 27: 
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 28: 
    * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 29: 
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up all the triangles formed:

Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 19) + 2 (Node 25) + 1 (Node 28) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
