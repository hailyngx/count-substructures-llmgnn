Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
[<0, 4, 6>, <0, 2, 3>, <4, 6, 8>]

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
