Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (18, 25) -> 18 and 25 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 16) -> 18 and 16 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 15) -> 18 and 15 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 12) -> 18 and 12 are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (25, 16) -> 25 and 16 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (25, 15) -> 25 and 15 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (25, 12) -> 25 and 12 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (16, 15) -> 16 and 15 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (16, 12) -> 16 and 12 are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (15, 12) -> 15 and 12 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No pairs can be formed for Node 1 with higher-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
