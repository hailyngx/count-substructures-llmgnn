Response:
Following the same process as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Not neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are directly connected, but 0 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are directly connected, but 0 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected, but 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are directly connected. One triangle formed: <1, 5, 4>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are directly connected. One triangle formed: <2, 8, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are directly connected. One triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 7 are directly connected. One triangle formed: <3, 7, 1>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3, as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are directly connected. One triangle formed: <4, 6, 1>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are directly connected. One triangle formed: <4, 5, 1>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected, but 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4, as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.
