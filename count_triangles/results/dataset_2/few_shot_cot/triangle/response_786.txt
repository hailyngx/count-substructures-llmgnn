Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 2>, <1, 2, 3>, <3, 1, 2>, <3, 2, 1>, <4, 5, 16>, <5, 4, 16>, and <4, 14, 16>.
So, the final answer is [7].
