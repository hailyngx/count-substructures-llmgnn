Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> Both 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 17 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (17, 10) -> 17 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (11, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 15 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (15, 14) -> 15 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * Skipped because they have smaller numbered neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (15, 10) -> 15 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 15 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because they have smaller numbered neighbors.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 15, and 5 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 16 and 17:
    * Skipped because they have smaller numbered neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles found so far:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
