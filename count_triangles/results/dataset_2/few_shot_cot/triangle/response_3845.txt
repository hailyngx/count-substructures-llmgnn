Response:
Let's start by counting the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Connected as (6, 12), (12, 2), so a triangle is formed <0, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> Connected as (2, 0), (0, 10), so a triangle is formed <0, 2, 10>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> Connected as (6, 0), (0, 10), so a triangle is formed <0, 6, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are also directly connected.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Connected as (5, 2), (2, 12), so a triangle is formed <2, 5, 12>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Connected as (0, 10), (10, 2), so a triangle is formed <0, 2, 10>.
    * Pair 3: (0, 14) -> Connected as (0, 2), (2, 14), so a triangle is formed <0, 2, 14>.
    * Pair 4: (12, 14) -> Connected as (12, 2), (2, 14), so a triangle is formed <2, 12, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are also directly connected.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Connected as (1, 4), (4, 13), so a triangle is formed <1, 4, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Connected as (1, 4), (4, 6), so a triangle is formed <1, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> Connected as (6, 4), (4, 13), so a triangle is formed <4, 6, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are also directly connected.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Connected as (4, 13), (13, 8), so a triangle is formed <4, 8, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Connected as (3, 7), (7, 5), so a triangle is formed <3, 5, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Connected as (12, 8), (8, 13), so a triangle is formed <8, 12, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are also directly connected.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> Connected as (0, 10), (10, 12), so a triangle is formed <0, 10, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are also directly connected.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are also directly connected.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Connected as (9, 13), (13, 11), so a triangle is formed <9, 11, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are also directly connected.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 10>, <0, 6, 10>, <2, 5, 12>, <0, 2, 14>, <2, 12, 14>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 13>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 8, 13>, <8, 12, 13>, <0, 10, 12>, <9, 11, 13>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [14].
