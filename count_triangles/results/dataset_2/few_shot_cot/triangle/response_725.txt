Response:
Following the same procedure as described in the example with each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 23) -> 11 and 23 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are directly connected and form a triangle with the edge (1, 13).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
