Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example mentioned earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 0) from the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (6, 1) from the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (7, 0) from the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangle as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 4.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also connected as (4, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangle as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 11.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are also connected as (7, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangle as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 13.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangle as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 9.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
