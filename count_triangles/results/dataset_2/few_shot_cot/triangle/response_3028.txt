Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 5, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) - 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are missing a direct edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

\* Node 2:
    \* Skip the pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    \* Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    \* Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

\* Nodes 3, 4, 5:
    \* No other nodes left to form triangles with.

\* Node 6:
    \* Pair 1: (1, 9) - 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 6 because there is no direct edge.
    \* Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

\* Node 7:
    \* No pairs of 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.

\* Node 8:
    \* Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but there is no direct connection between 4 and 9. No triangle formed.
    \* Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

\* Node 9:
    \* No pairs of 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
\[3\]

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
