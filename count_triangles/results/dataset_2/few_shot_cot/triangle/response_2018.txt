Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 26) -> 13 and 26 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are directly connected as (13, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are directly connected as (11, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are directly connected as (11, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are directly connected as (5, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are directly connected as (5, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 21) -> 5 and 21 are directly connected as (5, 21) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (13, 21) -> 13 and 21 are directly connected as (13, 21) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 25) -> 5 and 25 are directly connected as (5, 25) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are directly connected as (11, 17) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5 to 29:
    * Skipping these nodes as they have smaller numbering compared to 30.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are directly connected as (11, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (21, 8) -> 21 and 8 are directly connected as (21, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (27, 9) -> 27 and 9 are directly connected as (27, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 15 to 29:
    * Skipping these nodes as they have smaller numbering compared to 30.

* Node 30:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 30 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 30 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Counting all the triangles formed by considering each node as the smallest numbered node:

[<0, 2, 13>, <1, 7, 11>, <2, 5, 12>, <2, 5, 13>, <2, 5, 21>, <2, 13, 21>, <3, 5, 25>, <4, 11, 17>, <4, 5, 6>, <8, 11, 21>, <8, 21, 25>, <9, 9, 27>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
