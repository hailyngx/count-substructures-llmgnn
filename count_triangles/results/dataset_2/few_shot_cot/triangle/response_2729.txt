Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Forms a triangle with node 8 as (1, 3, 8).
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with node 5 as (2, 3, 5).
    - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Forms a triangle with node 7 as (2, 6, 7).
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with node 3 as (5, 7, 3).
    - Pair 2: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 4 as (7, 8, 4).
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with node 8 as (5, 7, 8).
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skip as all adjacent nodes are smaller.

7. Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with node 1 as (5, 9, 1).
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with node 7 as (4, 6, 7).
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Node 9:
    - Skip as all adjacent nodes are smaller.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
