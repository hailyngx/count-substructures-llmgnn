Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

  * Node 0:
      * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are not connected because there is no edge (2, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Node 1:
      * Since Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes, there are no triangles involving Node 1.

  * Node 2:
      * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are connected through edge (0, 2) and (2, 5). Triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 3:
      * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Node 4:
      * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are connected through edge (4, 8) and (10, 4). Triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 5:
      * Pair 1: (17, 13) -> 17 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
      * Pair 2: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are connected through edge (17, 5) and (5, 19). Triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 6:
      * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
      * Pair 2: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Node 7:
      * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
      * Pair 2: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are connected through edge (18, 19) and (19, 5). Triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Nodes 8, 9, and 10:
      * Skipped as there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than them.

  * Node 11:
      * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Nodes 12, 13, 14, and 15:
      * Skipped as there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than them.

  * Node 16:
      * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are connected through edge (16, 18) and (18, 7). Triangle formed.
      * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Nodes 17, 18, and 19:
      * Skipped as there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
