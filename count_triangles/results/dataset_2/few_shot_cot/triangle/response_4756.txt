Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph with the given information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 0 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 2) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 1 are also connected as (0, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 3 are also connected as (0, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 0 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 5) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 6) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 11 are also connected as (1, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 14 are also connected as (1, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 7 are also connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 13 are also connected as (2, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 14 are also connected as (2, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 0 are also connected as (2, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 0 are also connected as (3, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 3 and 10 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 10) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 13 are also connected as (3, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3
