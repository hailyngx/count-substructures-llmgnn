Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Nodes 3 to 9:
    * Skipping these nodes as they have less than 2 nodes greater than them for triangle formation.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10.
    * Pair 3: (11, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 13:
    * Since Node 13 has only one connection, no triangles can be formed with it.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0*6 (Nodes 3 to 9) + 3 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 14) = 15.

Therefore, there are [15] triangles in the given graph.
