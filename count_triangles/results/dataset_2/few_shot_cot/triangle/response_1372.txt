Response:
Following the same process as described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes since 9 is the smallest.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least two nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
