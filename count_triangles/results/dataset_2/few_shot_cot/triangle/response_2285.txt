Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are directly connected as (7, 11) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are directly connected as (5, 11) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are directly connected as (4, 14) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3). No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11). No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
