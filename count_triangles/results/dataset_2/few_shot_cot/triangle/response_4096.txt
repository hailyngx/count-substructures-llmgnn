Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> Both 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> Both 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> Both 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> Both 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Both 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
  * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
  * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> Both 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
  * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> Both 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
  * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> Both 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
  * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> Both 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
