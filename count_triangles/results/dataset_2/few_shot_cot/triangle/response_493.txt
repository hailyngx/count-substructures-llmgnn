Response:
Following the process described in the previous example step-by-step, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Skip evaluating triangles involving nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 7) and (7, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 8) and (8, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip triangles involving nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 8) and (8, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (7, 8) and (8, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skipped due to nodes smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped due to nodes smaller than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip triangles with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (3, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skipped due to nodes smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skipped due to nodes smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip from the evaluation due to nodes smaller than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
