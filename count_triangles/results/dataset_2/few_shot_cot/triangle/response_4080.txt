Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are connected through Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) - 5 and 11 are not connected directly. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) - 5 and 12 are connected through Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) - 2 and 8 are connected through Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) - 2 and 13 are not connected directly. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are not connected directly. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 1) - 2 and 1 are connected through Node 1.
    * Pair 5: (8, 13) - 8 and 13 are not connected directly. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 6) - 8 and 6 are not connected directly. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 1) - 8 and 1 are connected through Node 1.
    * Pair 8: (13, 6) - 13 and 6 are connected through Node 1.
    * Pair 9: (13, 4) - 13 and 4 are not connected directly. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 4) - 6 and 4 are connected through Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Similar to Node 1, we skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) - 10 and 14 are connected through Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (10, 7) - 10 and 7 are connected through Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (14, 7) - 14 and 7 are connected through Node 2.
    * No more pairs left for Node 2 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are connected through Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) - 4 and 1 are connected through Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are connected through Node 3.
    * No more pairs left for Node 3 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) - 5 and 14 are connected through Node 4.
    * No more pairs left for Node 4 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 4, and 7.
    * No more pairs left for Node 5 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Since each of these nodes has fewer than 2 nodes greater than itself, we do not calculate triangles for these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6-14) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
