Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 25) - Nodes 9 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 26) - Nodes 9 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (25, 26) - Nodes 25 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 but not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Nodes 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 21) - Nodes 5 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 but not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 21) - Nodes 9 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 29) - Nodes 6 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) - Nodes 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (11, 24) - Nodes 11 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (19, 24) - Nodes 19 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 22) - Nodes 7 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 28) - Nodes 1 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (20, 29) - Nodes 20 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (19, 29) - Nodes 19 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than any of these nodes to form triangles.

* Node 23:
    * Pair 1: (24, 26) - Nodes 24 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 23, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
    * Skipped for the same reason as above.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 23) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
