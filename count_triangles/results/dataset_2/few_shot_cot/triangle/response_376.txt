Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example above for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are directly connected as (1, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 7 are directly connected as (0, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 12 are directly connected as (1, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 12 are directly connected as (7, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 10 are directly connected as (3, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 3 are directly connected as (0, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 14 are directly connected as (3, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 13 are directly connected as (4, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
