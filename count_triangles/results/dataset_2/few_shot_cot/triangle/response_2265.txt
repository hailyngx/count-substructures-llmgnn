Response:
Following the methodology from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

    1. Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (14, 21) -> Both 14 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (14, 27) -> Both 14 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (14, 27) in the edge list. 
        * Pair 3: (14, 4) -> Both 14 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (21, 27) -> Both 21 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (21, 27) in the edge list.
        * Pair 5: (21, 4) -> Both 21 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (27, 4) -> Both 27 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    2. Node 1:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
        * No other pairs to consider as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 1 to form a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    3. Node 2:
        * No other pairs to consider due to the lack of suitable nodes to form triangles with 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    4. Node 3:
        * Same as Node 2, no pairs to form triangles with 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    5. Node 4:
        * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1, then consider:
            * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> Both 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (4, 17) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    Continue this process similarly for Nodes 5 to 29:

    6. Node 5:
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    7. Node 6:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    8. Node 7:
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    9. Node 8:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    10. Node 9:
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    11. Node 10:
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    12. Node 11:
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    13. Node 12:
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    14. Node 13:
        * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    15. Node 14:
        * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    16. Node 15:
        * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    17. Node 16:
        * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    18. Node 17:
        * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    19. Node 18:
        * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    20. Node 19:
        * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    21. Node 20:
        * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    22. Node 21:
        * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    23. Node 22:
        * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    24. Node 23:
        * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    25. Node 24:
        * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    26. Node 25:
        * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    27. Node 26:
        * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    28. Node 27:
        * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    29. Node 28:
        * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Now, summing up all the triangles found for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 3
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [27].

The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 17, 13>, <8, 13, 28>, <13, 28, 22>, <9, 5, 14>, <5, 9, 27>, <11, 18, 19>, <10, 24, 25>, <0, 14, 27>, <1, 19, 26>, <7, 11, 27>, <18, 19, 11>, <13, 15, 2>, <16, 5, 14>, <8, 6, 11>, <15, 13, 18>, <22, 19, 18>, <9, 3, 27>, <20, 26, 21>, <5, 12, 20>, <10, 26, 21>, <26, 21, 28>, <14, 28, 21>, <10, 6, 11>, <26, 1, 19>, <16, 29, 5>, <0, 4, 17>, but remember to write them only once like <4, 17, 13>.
