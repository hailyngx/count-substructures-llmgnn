Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the previous example:

1. **Node 0:**
   * Triangle 1: (3, 7) - Nodes 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
   * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Nodes 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 2: (2, 9) - Nodes 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
   * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
   * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Nodes 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of node 2, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
   * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
   * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Nodes 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of node 3, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
   * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
   * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Nodes 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 4, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
   * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
   * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
   * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
   * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
   * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
   * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
   * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
