Response:
Following the step-by-step process as explained in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Connected through node 2. No edge between 8 and 2. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> Connected through node 10. No edge between 2 and 10. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> Connected through node 3. No edge between 3 and 8. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (3, 10) -> Connected through node 10. Edge between 3 and 10. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (8, 10) -> Connected through node 0. No edge between 8 and 10. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Connected through node 10. No edge between 9 and 10. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (10, 13) -> Connected through node 10. No edge between 10 and 13. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (10, 14) -> Connected through node 10. No edge between 10 and 14. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (13, 14) -> Connected through node 13. No edge between 13 and 14. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Connected through node 3. No edge between 3 and 6. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> Connected through node 6. No edge between 6 and 12. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3. They are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> Connected through node 7. No edge between 7 and 11. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> Connected through node 4. No edge between 11 and 13. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. They are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Connected through node 5. No edge between 7 and 11. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. They are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Connected through node 7. No edge between 9 and 14. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
