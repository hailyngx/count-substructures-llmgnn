Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, I will find the number of triangles in the graph provided.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected directly, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not connected directly, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (18, 25) -> 18 and 25 are not connected directly, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 22) -> 10 and 22 are not connected directly, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (19, 29) -> 19 and 29 are not connected directly, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not connected directly, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are not connected directly, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are not connected directly, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (12, 29) -> 12 and 29 are not connected directly, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 24, 26, and 27:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with two other larger numbered nodes to form a triangle.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (22, 25) -> 22 and 25 are not connected directly, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (27, 6) -> 27 and 6 are not connected directly, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 20:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 20.
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 22:
    * Pair 1: (23, 20) -> 23 and 20 are not connected directly, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 23:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 23.
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 25:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 25.
    * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 28:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 28.
    * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 29:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 29.
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 0.
* The final answer is [0].
