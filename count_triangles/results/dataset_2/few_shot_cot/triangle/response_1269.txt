Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 22) -> 15 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (15, 22) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 22) -> 17 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique Triangles: <0, 15, 22>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (3, 1) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique Triangles: <1, 3, 2>

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 24) -> 3 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8:
    * Skipped because they are smaller than or equal to 3.

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. Total triangles = 0.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also connected as (5, 10) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also connected as (13, 10) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique Triangle: <5, 6, 10>

* Remaining nodes:
    * Nodes 11 to 29 are all either smaller than 10 or not connected to nodes greater than 10, so they do not participate in forming triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 15, 22>, <1, 3, 2>, <5, 6, 10>]
