Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
