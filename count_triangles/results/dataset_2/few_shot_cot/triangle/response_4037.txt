Response:
Following the steps from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) - Both 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 18) - Both 7 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 18) - Both 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 18) - Both 12 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) - Both 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (15, 4) - Both 15 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 10) - Both 17 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 13) - Both 17 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) - Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 7) - Both 11 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 8) - Both 11 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Only 1-hop neighbors of Node 5 are 12. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8:
    * Similar calculations for nodes 6, 7, and 8 are already covered, so we skip them.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) - Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 16) - Both 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 16) - Both 11 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [10].
