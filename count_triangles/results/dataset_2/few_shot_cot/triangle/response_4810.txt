Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> <2, 9, 18>
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (18, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 4) -> <0, 2, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes connected. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes connected. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (18, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No other nodes connected. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 14:
    * No other nodes connected. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 15:
    * No other nodes connected. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 16:
    * No other nodes connected. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 17:
    * No other nodes connected. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 18:
    * No other nodes connected. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 19:
    * No other nodes connected. No triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
