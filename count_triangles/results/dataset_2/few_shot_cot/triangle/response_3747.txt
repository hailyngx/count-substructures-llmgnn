Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than Node 1 since those were already covered.
    * No other pairs are left to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Checking for the third node.
    * <2, 7, 8> form a triangle.
    * Continue checking pairs involving 2.
    * No other pairs are left to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs involving nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * No other pairs are left to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skipping other pairs as they have nodes smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs are left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 but not connected.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and connected.
    * Checking for the third node.
    * <6, 11, 13> form a triangle.
    * No other pairs are left to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 but not connected.
    * Skipping other pairs as they have nodes smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs are left to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 but not connected.
    * Skipping other pairs as they have nodes smaller than 8.
    * No other pairs are left to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9 to 14:
    * Skipping as there are no pairs with at least 2 nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9 to Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
