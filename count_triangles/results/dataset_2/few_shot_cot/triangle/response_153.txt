Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected (5, 0) and (0, 3) are edges. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected (6, 0) and (0, 7) are edges. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected (7, 0) and (0, 3) are edges. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected (5, 2) and (2, 1) are edges. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected (4, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected (9, 3) and (3, 4) are edges. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected (9, 8) and (8, 3) are edges. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected (4, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected (7, 8) and (8, 3) are edges. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * All pairs involving these nodes have been considered in the previous steps. No additional triangles involving these nodes can be formed at this point.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
