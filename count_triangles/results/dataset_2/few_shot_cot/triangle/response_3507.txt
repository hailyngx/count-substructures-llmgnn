Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above to count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (3, 18) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (0, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (18, 2) -> 18 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (0, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (19, 2) -> 19 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (16, 5) -> 16 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (16, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (5, 19) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (6, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (0, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (18, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (14, 0) -> 14 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (18, 0) -> 18 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (0, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (0, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (18, 0) -> 18 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (0, 18) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continue the process for Nodes 5 to 19...
