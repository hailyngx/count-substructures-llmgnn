Response:
Following the step-by-step method used in the previous example, we will find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 28) -> 14 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (14, 17) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 28) -> 17 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Not enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 7) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the answer is [4].
