Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Node 1 and Node 2 are connected through edge (1, 0) and edge (1, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Node 2 and Node 4 are connected through edge (2, 5) and edge (4, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Node 4 and Node 7 are connected through edge (4, 0) and edge (7, 0). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Node 0 and Node 2 are connected through edge (0, 2) and edge (0, 1). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> Node 0 and Node 4 are connected through edge (0, 4) and edge (0, 1). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> Node 0 and Node 5 are connected through edge (0, 1) and edge (0, 4). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> Node 2 and Node 6 are connected through edge (2, 5) and edge (6, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and Node 8 are connected through edge (4, 8) and edge (4, 0). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Node 0 and Node 3 are connected through edge (0, 2) and edge (3, 2). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Node 3 and Node 4 are connected through edge (3, 4) and edge (3, 9). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Node 2 and Node 4 are connected through edge (3, 2) and edge (4, 3). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Node 5 and Node 6 are connected through edge (5, 6) and edge (5, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Node 5 and Node 8 are connected through edge (5, 1), edge (5, 9), edge (8, 4), and edge (8, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Node 2 and Node 5 are connected through edge (2, 5) and edge (6, 5). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Node 4 and Node 5 are connected through edge (4, 5) and edge (6, 5). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed from this node as there is only one other node greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
