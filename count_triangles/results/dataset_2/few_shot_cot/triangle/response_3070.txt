Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. This forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. This forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. This forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 4: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. This forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. This forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. This forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. This forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. This forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. This forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. This forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node due to the lack of at least 2 larger nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Nodes 7-14) = 10.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
