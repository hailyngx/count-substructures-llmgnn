Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node: 

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 as it's smaller than 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it's smaller than 3.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 8, 9 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it's smaller than 5.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it's smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 as it's smaller than 7.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it's smaller than 8.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
