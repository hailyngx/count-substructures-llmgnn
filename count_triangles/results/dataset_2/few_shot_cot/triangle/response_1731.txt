Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example, let's now determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (6, 8). Triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 8). Triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) - Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (9, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
