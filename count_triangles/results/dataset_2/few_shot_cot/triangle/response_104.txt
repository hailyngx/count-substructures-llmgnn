Response:
Following the same methodology as explained in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (22, 24) -> 22 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 22 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 13 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 24) -> 9 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 9 and 24 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 24) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 9 and 19 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 9 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 25) -> 9 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 25 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (27, 12) -> 27 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 27 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (27, 6) -> 27 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 27 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (27, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 12 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (12, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summing up all the triangles from each node:

[5] 

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
