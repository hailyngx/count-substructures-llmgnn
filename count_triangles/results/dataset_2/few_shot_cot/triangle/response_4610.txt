Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 4 to 19.

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4-6) + 0 (Nodes 7-19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [5].
