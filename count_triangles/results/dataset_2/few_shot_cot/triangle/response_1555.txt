Response:
Alright, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    - Triangle: <2, 4, 17>

* Node 3:
    - Triangle: <3, 4, 17>

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
