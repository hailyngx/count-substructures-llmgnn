Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, here is the breakdown of counting triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 18 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) - 13 and 17 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip other pairs with smaller nodes. No possible new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip other pairs with smaller nodes. No possible new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip other pairs with smaller nodes. No possible new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 to 19:
    * Not considered because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
