Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> No edge between 2 and 14. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * <5, 14, 1> -> 5, 14, and 1 are all connected to each other. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are connected. Considering (13, 1) or (1, 4) would lead to duplicate triangles.
            * Pair 4: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are connected. Considering (4, 13) would lead to a duplicate triangle.
            * Pair 5: (6, 14) -> 1, 6, and 14 are not all connected in a triangle. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
            * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * <5, 13, 4> -> 5, 13, and 4 are all connected to each other. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * <3, 12, 10> -> 3, 12, and 10 are all connected to each other. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
            * Skipped individually as they do not have a combination of at least 2 other nodes greater than them connected to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 6.

        Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

        Therefore, the answer is [6].
