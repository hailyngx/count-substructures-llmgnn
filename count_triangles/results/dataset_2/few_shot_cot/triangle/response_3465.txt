Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip Node 0 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 1:
    * Skip Node 1 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 2 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Nodes 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and Nodes 1 and 2 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 4 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 5 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 6 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 7:
    * Skip Node 7 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 8 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 9 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 10:
    * Skip Node 10 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 11:
    * Skip Node 11 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> Nodes 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 12, and Nodes 4 and 18 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip Node 13 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 14:
    * Skip Node 14 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 15:
    * Skip Node 15 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 16:
    * Skip Node 16 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 17:
    * Skip Node 17 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 18:
    * Skip Node 18 as it has no 2-hop paths.

* Node 19:
    * Skip Node 19 as it has no 2-hop paths.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 12) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
