Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 0 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 1) -> 13 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 13 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 12 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 13 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 3) -> 11 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 11 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 5 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
* Node 7:
* Node 8:
* Node 9:
* Node 10:
* Node 11:
* Node 12:
* Node 13:
* Node 14:

Continue the process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, and then provide the final count of triangles inside brackets [].
