Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are not connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (7, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (6, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (8, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skip all pairs as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
