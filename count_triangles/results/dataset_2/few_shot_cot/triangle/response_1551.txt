Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Triangle <0, 8, 9>
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Triangle <0, 6, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Triangle <1, 7, 10>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Triangle <2, 11, 13>
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Triangle <2, 5, 14>
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Triangle <2, 6, 7>
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 12) -> Triangle <2, 12, 13>
    * Pair 6: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Triangle <3, 6, 7>
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Triangle <3, 9, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> Triangle <4, 5, 10>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Triangle <6, 12, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9: 
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than any of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10 triangles] in the given graph.
