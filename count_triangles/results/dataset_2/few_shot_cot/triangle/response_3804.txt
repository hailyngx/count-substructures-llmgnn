Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 2. Triangle <0, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 6. Triangle <1, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 9. Triangle <1, 2, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 9. Triangle <1, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped since they don't have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
[<0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 6, 9>]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
