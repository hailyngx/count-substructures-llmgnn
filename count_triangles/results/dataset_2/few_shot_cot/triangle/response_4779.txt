Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 13 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 11 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing the process for Nodes 11 to 19 would lead to a count of triangles, which can then be summed up to find the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed with this calculation.
