Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 22) -> 11 and 22 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 22) -> 7 and 22 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node due to the absence of other nodes greater than 5 connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Proceeding in this manner for each node:

* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 1 triangle
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 1 triangle
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 1 triangle
* Node 13: 2 triangles
* Node 14: 1 triangle
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 0 triangles
* Node 22: 0 triangles
* Node 23: 0 triangles
* Node 24: 4 triangles
* Node 25: 0 triangles
* Node 26: 0 triangles
* Node 27: 0 triangles
* Node 28: 0 triangles
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Summing up the total number of triangles in the graph:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 4 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 12

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
