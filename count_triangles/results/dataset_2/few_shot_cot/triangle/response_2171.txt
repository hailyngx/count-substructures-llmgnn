Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown.
    * No other nodes to form more triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown.
    * No other nodes to form more triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes to form more triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes to form more triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes to form more triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are also connected as shown.
    * No other nodes to form more triangles with Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles observed:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
