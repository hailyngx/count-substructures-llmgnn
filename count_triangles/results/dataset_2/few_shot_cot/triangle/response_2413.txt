Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same method as in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * No more triangle pairs for Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * No more triangle pairs for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more triangle pairs for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * No more triangle pairs for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * No more triangle pairs for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more triangle pairs for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * No more triangle pairs for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * No more triangle pairs for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more triangle pairs for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more triangle pairs for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
