Response:
Following the same process outlined in the initial explanation:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are connected to node 0, and they are also directly connected to each other as per the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are connected to node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 24) -> Both 15 and 24 are connected to node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 13) -> Both 15 and 13 are connected to node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 27) -> Both 15 and 27 are connected to node 1, and they are also directly connected as (15, 27) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (28, 11) -> Both 28 and 11 are connected to node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (28, 29) -> Both 28 and 29 are connected to node 2, and they are also directly connected as (28, 29) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 25) -> Both 28 and 25 are connected to node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 23) -> Both 10 and 23 are connected to node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are connected to node 3, and they are also directly connected as (10, 12) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (22, 14) -> Both 22 and 14 are connected to node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 26) -> Both 22 and 26 are connected to node 4, and they are also directly connected as (22, 26) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 25) -> Both 22 and 25 are connected to node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 5 and 9 are connected to node 5, and they are also directly connected to each other as per the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (19, 13) -> Both 19 and 13 are connected to node 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (16, 25) -> Both 16 and 25 are connected to node 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are connected to node 9, and they are also directly connected to each other as per the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are connected to node 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (23, 15) -> Both 23 and 15 are connected to node 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11 to 19:
    * Skipped due to smaller numbered nodes forming triangles already.

* Node 20:
    * Pair 1: (24, 1) -> Both 24 and 1 are connected to node 20, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 21 to 29:
    * Skipped due to smaller numbered nodes forming triangles already.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph: 10.

Final answer: [10]
