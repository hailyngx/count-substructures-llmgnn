Response:
Following the method outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected and are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as all the other nodes are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<3, 4, 2>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, and <5, 6, 9>.

The final answer is [7].
