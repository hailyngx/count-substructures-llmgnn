Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) - Both 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) - Both 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 11) - Both 14 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) - Both 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) - Both 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 2) - Both 12 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) - Both 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) - Both 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) - Both 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 3: 0 triangles
* Node 4: 1 triangle
* Node 5: 1 triangle
* Node 6: 3 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 1 triangle
* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 2 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 1 triangle

Calculating the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 2 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 16

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.
