Response:
Let's follow the same process as shown in the example to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 1) -> 17 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 17 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (17, 14) -> 17 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 17 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more possible pairs involving Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 17 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * No more possible pairs involving Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (11, 3) -> Both 11 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 3 are directly connected as (11, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No more possible pairs involving Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (12, 7) -> 12 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 12 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 12 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 12 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 11) -> Both 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 11 are directly connected as (5, 11) shown in the edge list. 
    * No more possible pairs involving Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more possible pairs involving Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more possible pairs involving Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19: 
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Continuing the analysis, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<17, 1, 7>, 
<17, 0, 1>, 
<12, 3, 7>, 
<12, 3, 13>, 
<12, 5, 7>, 
<11, 3, 5>, 
<14, 10, 16>.
