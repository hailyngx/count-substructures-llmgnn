Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example for each node to find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 25) -> 6 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 25) -> 14 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0).
    * No valid triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1).
    * No valid triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2).
    * No valid triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).
    * No valid triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
    * No valid triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
    * No valid triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
    * No valid triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).
    * Pair 1: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (13, 2). Possible triangle.
    * Pair 2: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 25) -> 13 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
    * No valid triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
    * No valid triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes in the graph, and then summing up the total number of triangles formed:

[Total number of triangles in the graph is []]
