Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (23, 28) and (23, 29) - Both are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (14, 4) - Both are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 24) - Both are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (14, 5) - Both are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 20:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 21:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 22:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 23:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 24:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 25:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 26:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 27:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 28:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 29:

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
