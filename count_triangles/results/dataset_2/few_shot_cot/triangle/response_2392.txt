Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the provided example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 4: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
        * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are connected in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 2. However, they do not form a triangle with 2 as they are not directly connected to each other.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

There can be a few mistakes in the counts while listing the triangles. Here is the corrected number of triangles with each node selected as the smallest numbered node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [5].
