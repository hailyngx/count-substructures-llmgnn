Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the provided example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 13) -> Node 9 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 15) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are directly connected. But there are no other nodes connected to both 6 and 12 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> Node 9 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are directly connected. But there are no other nodes connected to both 10 and 12 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are directly connected. But there are no other nodes connected to both 10 and 13 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are directly connected. But there are no other nodes connected to both 12 and 13 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    Skip all these nodes as they are larger than the total number of nodes in the graph.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 ([]).
