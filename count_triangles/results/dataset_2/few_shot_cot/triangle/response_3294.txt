Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as (0, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as (0, 5) in the edge list.

    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.

    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 18.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].

The unique triangles found can be listed as:
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <6, 7, 9>.
