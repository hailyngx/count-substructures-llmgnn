Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 11 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 1:
    * Continue checking for pairs involving node 1.
    * No triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Continue checking for pairs involving node 3.
    * Only one triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Continue checking for pairs involving node 4.
    * Only one triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Continue checking for pairs involving node 6.
    * No triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Continue checking for pairs involving node 7.
    * No triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 8 to 14:
    * No triangles formed as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8 to 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
