Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 5, 8.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 2, 5.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 2, 8.
    * Pair 4: (0, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1, 7, 8.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 1, 4, 7.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1, 2, 8.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 2, 5. (Already counted when analyzing Node 0)
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 2, 6, 5.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 2, 7, 4.
    * Pair 4: (0, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 2, 5. (Already counted when analyzing Node 0)
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 3, 4, 7.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 1, 4, 7. (Already counted when analyzing Node 1)
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 4, 6, 9.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 3, 4, 7. (Already counted when analyzing Node 3)
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 5, 6.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 2, 5. (Already counted when analyzing Node 0)
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 5, 6. (Already counted when analyzing Node 5)
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 4, 6, 9.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1, 6, 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 1, 4, 7. (Already counted when analyzing Node 1)
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 2, 7, 4. (Already counted when analyzing Node 2)
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 3, 4, 7. (Already counted when analyzing Node 3)
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1, 6, 8. (Already counted when analyzing Node 6)
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 2, 8. (Already counted when analyzing Node 0)

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 4, 6, 9. (Already counted when analyzing Node 6)
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [15].
