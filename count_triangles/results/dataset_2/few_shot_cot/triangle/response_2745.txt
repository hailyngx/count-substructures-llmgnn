Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
