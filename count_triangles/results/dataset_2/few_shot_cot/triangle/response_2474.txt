Response:
Following the example provided in the initial message, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - No triangles will be formed by Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

2. **Node 1:**
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) -> Nodes 12 and 15 form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> Nodes 3 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> Nodes 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 17) -> Nodes 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. **Node 4:**
    * No triangles will be formed by Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. **Node 5:**
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (16, 12) -> Nodes 16 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Nodes 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. **Node 7:**
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> Nodes 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
    * No triangles will be formed by Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. **Node 9:**
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> Nodes 5 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The remaining nodes (10 to 19) do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
