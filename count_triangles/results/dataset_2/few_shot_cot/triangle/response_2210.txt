Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3)

Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, and node 2

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (3, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3): No triangle can be formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4): No triangle can be formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5): No triangle can be formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Nodes 8 and 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
