Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Nodes 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (11, 0, 13). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Nodes 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> Nodes 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 1, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> Nodes 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> Nodes 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (12, 3, 16). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Nodes 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 4, 13). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> Nodes 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 6) -> Nodes 13 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (5, 6, 18). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* The examination of other nodes is not needed as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
