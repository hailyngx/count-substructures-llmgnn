Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:** 
    - Pair 1: Skipped as it includes nodes smaller than Node 0.
    - Pair 2: Skipped as it includes nodes smaller than Node 0.
    - Pair 3: Skipped as it includes nodes smaller than Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:** 
    - Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are not connected because (0, 10) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 10) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
       
3. **Node 2:**
    - ...

Continue this process for the remaining nodes in the graph until all nodes have been considered. 

Finally, calculate the total number of triangles in the graph by summing up the total triangles found for each node. Provide the answer inside brackets [] with the unique triangles listed inside <> such as <0, 2, 4>.
