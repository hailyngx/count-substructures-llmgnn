Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 9) -> 12 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 9) -> 13 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

The analysis will continue for the remaining nodes following the same process. Once all nodes have been considered, the total number of triangles will be counted and provided in the final answer. Let's continue this process now.
