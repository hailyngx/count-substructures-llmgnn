Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as provided in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 6, 8>
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 8, 7>
    * Pair 5: (8, 3) -> Triangle formed: <0, 8, 3>
    * Pair 6: (8, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 8, 7>
    * Pair 7: (7, 3) -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> Triangle formed: <1, 8, 7>
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> Triangle formed: <1, 7, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> Triangle formed: <2, 6, 4>
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> Triangle formed: <2, 9, 4>
    * Pair 6: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 7>
    * Pair 8: (4, 3) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 3>
    * Pair 9: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> Triangle formed: <3, 6, 4>
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 7>
    * Pair 6: (4, 2) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 2>
    * Pair 7: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> Triangle formed: <7, 2, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 15.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
