Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 18 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs left to explore.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 10) -> 11 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs left to explore.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 14 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 14 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (14, 0) -> 14 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 5) -> 14 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge between 14 and 5 in the list. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs left to explore.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Given the data provided, the total number of triangles in the graph can be calculated as follows:

\[Total = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + ... \]

After this detailed process for all nodes, calculate the total number of triangles in the graph and list the unique triangles found inside brackets [].
