Response:
Following the step-by-step triangle counting procedure illustrated in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are connected, but no edge exists between them in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are connected, and they form a triangle with Node 0.
    - Pair 3: (19, 5) -> 19 and 5 are connected, but no edge exists between them in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - **Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1**

2. **Node 1:**
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are connected, but no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are connected, but no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - **Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0**

3. **Node 2:**
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are connected, and they form a triangle with Node 2.
    - **Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1**

4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are connected, but no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are connected, but no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - **Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0**

5. **Node 4:**
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are connected, but no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - **Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0**

6. **Node 5:**
    - Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are connected, but no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - **Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0**

7. **Node 6:**
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes smaller than 6.
    - **Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0**

8. **Node 7:**
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes smaller than 7.
    - **Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0**

9. **Node 8:**
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes smaller than 8.
    - Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are connected, but no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are connected, and they form a triangle with Node 8.
    - Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected, but no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - **Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1**

10. **Node 9:**
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes smaller than 9.
    - **Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0**

Continue this process for Nodes 10 to 19 to compute the total number of triangles.
