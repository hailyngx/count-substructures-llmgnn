Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected directly as (2, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected directly as (2, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected directly as (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected directly as (3, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected directly as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected directly as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are connected directly as (7, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip this node as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected directly as (1, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected directly as (6, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected directly as (9, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no sets of 3 nodes that are interconnected.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are connected directly as (1, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are connected directly as (8, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected directly as (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected directly as (1, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip this node as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
