Response:
Following the step-by-step process as demonstrated in the previous example to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (5, 0) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Pair 3: (9, 0) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (1, 9) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (1, 3) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Pair 3: (1, 2) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Pair 4: (1, 4) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (2, 9) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (2, 1) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Pair 3: (2, 4) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (3, 1) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (3, 7) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Pair 3: (3, 6) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Pair 4: (3, 4) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (4, 1) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (4, 2) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (5, 0) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (8, 5) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (9, 1) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (9, 2) - No triangle formed as they are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
