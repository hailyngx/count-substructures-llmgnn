Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 29) -> 11 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 11 and 29 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 11 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 11 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (29, 9) -> 29 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 29 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (25, 22) -> 25 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 25 and 22 are not directly connected as there is no edge (25, 22) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (25, 4) -> 25 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 25 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (22, 4) -> 22 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 22 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (22, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 11 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Repeat the process outlined for nodes 0, 1, and 2 for node 3. Continue this process for the remaining nodes.

[<0, 11, 29>, <0, 11, 9>, <1, 4, 25>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 9, 11>, <2, 9, 14>]

Finally, counting all the triangles found: [6]
