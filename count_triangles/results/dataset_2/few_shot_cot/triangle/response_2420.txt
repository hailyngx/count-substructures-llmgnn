Response:
Following the same process outlined in the example provided, let's analyze each node in the graph to count the number of triangles:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are connected.
        * Pair 2: (11, 10) -> 11 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 to 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.

        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 11:
        * Pair 1: (16, 10) -> 16 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 12:
        * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 13:
        * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 14:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as there are no connections.
        * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 15:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 to 13 as they are smaller than 15.
        * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 16:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 to 13 as they are smaller than 16.
        * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 17:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 to 13 as they are smaller than 17.
        * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 18:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 to 13 as they are smaller than 18.
        * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 19:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 to 13 as they are smaller than 19.
        * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
 * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.
 
 Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
