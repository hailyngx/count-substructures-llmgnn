Response:
Following the step-by-step process to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - <1, 2, 15>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - <1, 2, 15>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    - No triangles can be formed as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

12. Node 15:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. Nodes 16, 17, 18, 19:
    - Skipping these nodes as they are greater than previously checked nodes.

14. Node 20:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. Node 21:
    - <1, 21, 25>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 1

16. Node 22:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0

17. Nodes 23, 24, 25:
    - Skipping these nodes as they are greater than previously checked nodes.

18. Node 26:
    - <10, 26, 27>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 1

19. Node 27:
    - <10, 26, 27>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 1

20. Node 28:
    - <1, 2, 28>
    - <1, 17, 23>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 2

21. Node 29:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 0
Total triangles in the graph = 7
