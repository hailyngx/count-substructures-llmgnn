Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 5 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 3 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 19.

Therefore, there are 19 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are: [<0, 6, 10>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 12>, <2, 7, 1>, <2, 7, 3>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 12>, <2, 1, 3>, <2, 1, 12>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 12>, <2, 8, 14>, <5, 7, 13>, <6, 7, 10>, <7, 10, 9>, <8, 2, 14>, <9, 10, 13>, <10, 7, 3>, <10, 7, 6>]. Hence, the final answer is [19].
