Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the graph based on each node:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - The only pair to consider is (2, 4), but since 2 and 4 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
