Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example before:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> Triangle formed with Node 12: <0, 15, 18>
    * Pair 2: (18, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 15: <0, 18, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * All pairs with smaller nodes have been considered.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 11: <3, 4, 5>
    * No triangles can be formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 10: <5, 7, 8>
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 13: <6, 2, 8>
    * No triangles can be formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No triangles can be formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

There are a total of 5 unique triangles in the given graph: [<0, 15, 18>, <0, 18, 12>, <3, 4, 5>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 2, 8>]. Hence, the answer is [5].
