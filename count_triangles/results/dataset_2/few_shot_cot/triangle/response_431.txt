Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) - Both 9 and 19 are connected to Node 0, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) - Both 11 and 19 are connected to Node 1, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
