Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 10) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 10) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for nodes 2 to 14, then sum the total number of triangles found.

After counting triangles for all nodes, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 10, 1>
<1, 14, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 0>
<7, 2, 10>
