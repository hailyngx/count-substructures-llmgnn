Response:
Following the example provided for counting triangles in a graph, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. There is also an edge connecting them directly: (8, 1). Triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. No edge exists between 2 and 7. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Only pairs that contain nodes with higher numbers are considered, so no pair is considered for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are connected. No direct edge between 13 and 14. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected. No direct edge between 9 and 12. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are connected. No direct edge between 1 and 7. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs with higher numbered nodes are eligible for triangle formation.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are connected. No direct edge between 0 and 1. No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9 and are connected. No direct edge between 11 and 14. No triangle formed.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10 and are connected. No direct edge between 1 and 14. No triangle formed.

* Node 11:
    * No eligible pairs for triangle formation with nodes greater than 11.

* Node 12:
    * No eligible pairs for triangle formation with higher numbered nodes.

* Node 13:
    * No eligible pairs for triangle formation with higher numbered nodes.

* Node 14:
    * No eligible pairs for triangle formation with higher numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
