Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 4, 18>.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Not considered as 1 is greater than 5.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 9, 21>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not considered as 5 is greater than 9.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 4, 28>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 23) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 4, 23>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 28) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 4, 28>.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 21) -> Not considered as 3 is smaller than 21.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Not considered as 3 is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 3: (3, 19) -> Not considered as 3 is smaller than 19.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 23) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 23, 14>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 28) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 28, 18>.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> Not considered as 5 is smaller than 17.
    * Pair 2: (5, 21) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: <5, 21, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 26) -> Not considered as 5 is smaller than 26.
    * Pair 4: (5, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 5, 9>.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <6, 10, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 19) -> not considered as 6 is smaller than 19.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 22) -> Not considered as 7 is smaller than 22.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> Not considered as 7 is smaller than 12.
    * Pair 3: (7, 15) -> Not considered as 7 is smaller than 15.
    * Pair 4: (7, 26) -> Not considered as 7 is smaller than 26.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Not considered as 8 is smaller than 13.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: <5, 8, 13>.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: <6, 9, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 21) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: <5, 9, 21>.
    * Pair 3: (9, 24) -> Not considered as 9 is smaller than 24.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 5: (9, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: <9, 19, 12>.

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) -> Not considered as 10 is smaller than 17.
    * Pair 2: (10, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: <6, 9, 10>.
    * Pair 3: (10, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: <6, 9, 10>

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 1) -> Not considered as Node 11 is larger than 1.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: <9, 12, 19>.

No additional triangles are formed involving Nodes 13 to 30.

Summarizing the triangles found:
[<0, 4, 18>, <1, 9, 21>, <2, 4, 28>, <2, 4, 23>, <2, 4, 28>, <4, 23, 14>, <4, 28, 18>, <5, 21, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <6, 10, 9>, <9, 19, 12>, <6, 9, 10>]

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
