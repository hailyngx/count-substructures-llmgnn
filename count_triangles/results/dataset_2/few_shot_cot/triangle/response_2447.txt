Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example provided, I will now count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are directly connected in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
