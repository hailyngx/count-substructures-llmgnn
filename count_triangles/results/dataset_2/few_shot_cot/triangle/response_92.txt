Response:
Following the method outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. We can form a triangle with node 0 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. We can form another triangle with node 0 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. We can form a triangle with node 1 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 2. We can form a triangle with node 2 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 2. We can form another triangle with node 2 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected but are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 4. We can form a triangle with node 4 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 6. We can form a triangle with node 6 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 will be skipped since there are no pairs of nodes greater than these nodes where triangles could be formed.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
