Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: List fully checked. Moving on.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: List fully checked. Moving on.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No more nodes left to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * List fully checked. Moving on.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * List fully checked. Moving on.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * List fully checked. Moving on.

* Nodes 7 to 19:
    * Following the same process, all nodes are checked, and no triangles are found.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
