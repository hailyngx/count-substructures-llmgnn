Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as it is not connected to any other nodes.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing the same process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
* Node 5: 5 triangles
* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 1 triangle
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 3 triangles
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 4 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 1 triangle
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20]. 
The unique triangles found are <5, 9, 12>, <7, 2, 11>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 9, 12>, <12, 13, 14>, and <1, 5, 13>.
