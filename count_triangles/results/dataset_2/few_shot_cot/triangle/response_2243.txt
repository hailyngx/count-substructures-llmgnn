Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Already counted with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 13
Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
