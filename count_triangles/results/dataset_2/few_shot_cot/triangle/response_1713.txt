Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example given, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3. Triangle <0, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8. Triangle <0, 4, 3>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4. Triangle <0, 7, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7. Triangle <1, 5, 3>.
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6. Triangle <2, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0. Triangle <2, 5, 4>.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1. Triangle <2, 5, 3>.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7. Triangle <3, 1, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4. Triangle <3, 1, 0>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they are smaller than Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 which have already been considered.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
