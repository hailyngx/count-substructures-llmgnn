Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, but 14 is not. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 2: (12, 15) -> 12 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, but not directly connected to 15. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 15) -> 18 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, but not directly connected to 15. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 0) -> 11 is a 1-hop neighbor of 7, but not directly connected to 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
