Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are not connected because (2, 17) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (16, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pair with Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (7, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (8, 18) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (9, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * All skipped due to no other nodes to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
