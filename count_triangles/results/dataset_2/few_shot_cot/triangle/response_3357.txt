Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> Triangle formed <0, 2, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Triangle formed <2, 7, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one edge.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Triangle formed <4, 8, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one edge.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Triangle formed <6, 7, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> Triangle formed <7, 15, 19>.
    * Pair 2: (12, 19) -> Triangle formed <7, 12, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one edge.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one edge.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one edge.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one edge.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one edge.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one edge.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one edge.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> Triangle formed <15, 7, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one edge.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one edge.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> Triangle formed <11, 16, 18>.
    * Pair 2: (17, 18) -> Triangle formed <17, 18, 11>.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one edge.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 2 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
