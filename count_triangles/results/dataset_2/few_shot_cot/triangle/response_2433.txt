Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 2 are connected as (8, 2) and (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 13 are connected as (2, 0) and (0, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7) and (7, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 8) and (8, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (1, 6) and (6, 1).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 14) and (14, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Next, we will continue the process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. 

After going through each node in the graph, we calculate the total number of triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. 

The unique triangles found are as follows: <7, 1, 4>, <4, 9, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <1, 6, 3>, <7, 14, 4>, and <0, 2, 13>.
