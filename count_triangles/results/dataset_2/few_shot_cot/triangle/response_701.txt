Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least two nodes greater than each to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
