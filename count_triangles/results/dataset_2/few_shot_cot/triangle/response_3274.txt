Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 28) -> 15 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 21) -> 15 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (15, 21) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (26, 13) -> 26 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0 or Node 1.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 28) -> 6 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 20) -> 6 and 20 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:

    * No new triangle can be formed with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 29:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
