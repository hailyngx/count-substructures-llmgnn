Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) from the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) from the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) from the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 9) from the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 7 are also connected as (2, 7) from the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) from the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) from the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) from the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
