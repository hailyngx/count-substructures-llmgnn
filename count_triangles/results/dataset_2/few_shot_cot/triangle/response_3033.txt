28. Node 27:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 27 as the smallest node.

29. Node 28:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 28 as the smallest node.

30. Node 29:

Calculating the total number of triangles: 
- Total triangles = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 22) = 7

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
