Response:
Following the step-by-step method outlined in the example provided, here is the calculation for the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (20, 21) -> Both 20 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (20, 18) -> Both 20 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 18) -> Both 21 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (18, 29) -> Both 18 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (18, 11) -> Both 18 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 29) -> Both 11 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (11, 29) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 25) -> Both 4 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 28) -> Both 4 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 25) -> Both 8 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 26) -> Both 5 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (26, 12) -> Both 26 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Continue finding pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20:
    * Similar steps to calculate total triangles for each of these nodes.

* Node 21:
    * Start computing pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 22:
    * Calculate pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
    * Inspect possible pairs to count triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = [Sum of triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node]
* Provide the unique triangles found inside <> as a final answer.
