Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the first example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 2) -> Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    Similar to the example, we skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Keep proceeding like this for the remaining nodes to find all the triangles and then calculate the total number of triangles.

Let's continue this process for the remaining nodes.
