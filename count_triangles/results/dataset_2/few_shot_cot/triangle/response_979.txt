    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7 through 9:
  Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) - 8 is connected to 10, 19 is connected to 10, but 8 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (11, 7) - 11 is connected to 17, 7 is connected to 17, but 11 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 18 through 22:
  Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 18, 19, 20, 21, or 22.

* Node 23:
    * Pair 1: (28, 29) - 28 is connected to 23, 29 is connected to 23, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 25 through 29:
  Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 25, 26, 27, 28, or 29.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 unique triangles in the given graph.
[<5, 1, 7>, <4, 6, 29>]
