Following the example provided, we will count the number of triangles formed in the graph given using the process described. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
[*Total triangles in the graph* = *Sum of triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node*]
[*Total triangles in the graph* = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5]

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
