Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 26) - 11 and 26 are not connected as there is no edge (11, 26) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 24) - 11 and 24 are not connected as there is no edge (11, 24) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 24) - 26 and 24 are not connected as there is no edge (26, 24) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 29) - 12 and 29 are not connected as there is no edge (12, 29) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 16) - 12 and 16 are not connected as there is no edge (12, 16) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 29) - 16 and 29 are not connected as there is no edge (16, 29) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) - 13 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 27) - 6 and 27 are not connected as there is no edge (6, 27) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip considering any pairs since there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 5 to 29.

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 20:
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 21:
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 22:
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 23:
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 24:
    * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 25:
    * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 26:
    * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 27:
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 28:
    * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 29:

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29) = [1].

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
