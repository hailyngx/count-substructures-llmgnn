Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are directly connected as (6, 3) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 7 are directly connected as (9, 7) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are directly connected as (1, 3) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5:
    * Skipped as they have only smaller neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
