Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph following the process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No edge between 4 and 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No edge between 5 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No edge between 5 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>)

* Node 1:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 6, 7>)

* Continue this process for nodes 4 through 14, and then sum the total number of triangles found.

Upon analyzing all nodes:

* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
