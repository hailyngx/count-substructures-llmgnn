Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:
    
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Pair 1: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 13 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected directly as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected directly as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7: 
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected directly as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 10.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

The unique triangles found are:

<3, 8, 5>
<0, 7, 5>
<3, 8, 9>
<0, 7, 5>
