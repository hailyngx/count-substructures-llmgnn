Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: Skip as there are no other nodes greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0
  
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: Skip as one of the nodes is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: Skip as both nodes are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 2) -> 15 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3
    * Unique triangles involving Node 4: <4, 14, 15>, <4, 9, 16>

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangle involving Node 6: <6, 12, 13>

* Node 7:
    * Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangle involving Node 9: <4, 9, 16>

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 10.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 11.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 12.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 13.

* Node 14:
    * Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 14.

* Node 15:
    * Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 15.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 17.

* Node 18:
    * Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 18.

* Node 19:
    * Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 (Node 4) + 0 + 1 (Node 6) + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 9) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [5].
