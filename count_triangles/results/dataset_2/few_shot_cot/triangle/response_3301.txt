Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (8, 17) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (1, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (1, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) -> 0 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (0, 17). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 18) -> 0 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (17, 18). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
[<0, 8, 17>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 7, 3>, <7, 17, 18>, <0, 8, 17>, <1, 3, 5>].
Thus, the final answer is [6].
