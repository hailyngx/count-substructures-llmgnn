Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
