Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2)

Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 3

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process described in the initial example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are directly connected but are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving 0 and 1.
    * No triangles found with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected but are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are directly connected but are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles found with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
