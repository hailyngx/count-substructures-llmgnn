Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 27) -> 4 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 29) -> 4 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (27, 29) -> 27 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Similar steps as above applied to pairs where 1 is the smallest node. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs including 0 and 1 are skipped as they are smaller nodes. 
    * Triangle formed: <6, 10, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Triangles formed: <5, 8, 25> 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * No triangles formed for any of these nodes as there are no pairs with higher numbered nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<6, 10, 2>, <5, 8, 25>]
