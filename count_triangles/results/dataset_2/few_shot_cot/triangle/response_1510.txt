Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 22) -> Node 8 and 22 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 25) -> Node 8 and 25 are connected and form a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (26, 27) -> Node 26 and 27 are connected and form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 25) -> Node 9 and 25 are connected and form a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (28, 20) -> Node 28 and 20 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (29, 20) -> Node 29 and 20 are connected and form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 24) -> Node 11 and 24 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (26, 24) -> Node 26 and 24 are connected and form a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: No possible pair to form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (23, 14) -> Node 23 and 14 are connected but not directly connected to Node 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible pair to form a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (21, 16) -> Node 21 and 16 are connected but not directly connected to Node 10. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 11 to 29, we will calculate the total number of triangles in the graph based on each node's perspective.
