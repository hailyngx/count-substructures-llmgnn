Response:
Following the example given, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Node 1 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Node 2 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 5>.
    - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    - Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Triangle formed: <4, 5, 8>.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles as they are smaller than these nodes.

Calculating the total number of triangles: 
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5 through 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
