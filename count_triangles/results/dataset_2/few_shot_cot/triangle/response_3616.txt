Response:
Following the same process as in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (13, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (13, 17) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (6, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (15, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, and 11:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13.
    * Pair 2: (0, 17) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 13.
    * Pair 3: (0, 19) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 13.
    * Pair 4: (7, 17) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 13.
    * Pair 5: (7, 19) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 13.
    * Pair 6: (17, 19) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14 and 15:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 16:
    * Not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (13, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
