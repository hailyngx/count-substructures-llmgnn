Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Following the steps provided in the previous example for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 3 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * ....(continue same steps for Node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9)

After calculating for all nodes, sum up the total number of triangles formed:

* Total triangles in the graph: [24] 

There are 24 triangles in the given graph.
