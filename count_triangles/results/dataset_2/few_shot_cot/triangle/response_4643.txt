Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example provided:

    * Node 0: 
        * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (7,13) -> 7 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
        * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
        * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. 
        * Pair 5: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
        * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.

    Continue this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, then sum up the total triangles found.

    Finally, provide the total number of triangles within brackets [].
