Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 0: <0, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 1: <1, 4, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 3: <1, 3, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Form a triangle with Node 4: <4, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> Form a triangle with Node 6: <4, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Form a triangle with Node 8: <4, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 9: <5, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
