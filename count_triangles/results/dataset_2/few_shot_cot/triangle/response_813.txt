Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same method as the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected, but 3 and 8 don't have a common neighbor to form a triangle. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, but 4 and 8 don't have a common neighbor to form a triangle. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected, but 2 and 9 don't have a common neighbor to form a triangle. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are connected, but 2 and 1 don't have a common neighbor to form a triangle. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, but they don't share a common neighbor to form a triangle. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected, but they don't share a common neighbor to form a triangle. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are connected, but they don't share a common neighbor to form a triangle. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are connected, but they don't share a common neighbor to form a triangle. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7 to Node 14:
    * Since the remaining nodes have fewer than 2 nodes greater than them, we skip these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles: [0] (There are no triangles in the given graph)

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
