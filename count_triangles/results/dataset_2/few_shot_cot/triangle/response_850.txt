Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the given example, let's identify the number of triangles in the graph by considering each node individually:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (1, 2).
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 4).
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (3).
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (5).
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (2).
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
