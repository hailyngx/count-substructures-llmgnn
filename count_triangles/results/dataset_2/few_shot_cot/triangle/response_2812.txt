Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, we find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Connected, no additional node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 26) -> Connected, no additional node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> Not directly connected, skip.
    * Pair 4: (3, 24) -> Not directly connected, skip.
    * Pair 5: (15, 26) -> Not directly connected, skip.
    * Pair 6: (15, 6) -> Not directly connected, skip.
    * Pair 7: (15, 24) -> Not directly connected, skip.
    * Pair 8: (26, 6) -> Connected, no additional node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 9: (26, 24) -> Not directly connected, skip.
    * Pair 10: (6, 24) -> Connected, no additional node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (26, 29) -> Connected, no additional node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (26, 14) -> Connected, but no additional node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (26, 7) -> Not directly connected, skip.
    * Pair 4: (29, 14) -> Not directly connected, skip.
    * Pair 5: (29, 7) -> Not directly connected, skip.
    * Pair 6: (14, 7) -> Not directly connected, skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involve smaller-numbered nodes, skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs involve smaller-numbered nodes, skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs involve smaller-numbered nodes, skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pairs involve smaller-numbered nodes, skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pairs involve smaller-numbered nodes, skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Connected, no additional node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) -> Connected, but no additional node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (13, 16) -> Not directly connected, skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and beyond:
    * All nodes are smaller than 8 or are isolated nodes, so no triangles can be formed with them.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8 and beyond) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
