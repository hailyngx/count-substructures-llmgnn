Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by following the step-by-step process as shown in the previous example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 6) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 3) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 15) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 12) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (15, 12) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: Skipped as it includes Node 0 which is smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 0) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 1) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 12) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (17, 0) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (17, 3) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (14, 19) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (16, 18) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (11, 13) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (11, 15) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (13, 15) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 10:
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (13, 15) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 12:

- Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (7, 14) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 14:
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 15:
    - Pair 1: (16, 11) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 16:
    - Pair 1: (15, 11) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 17:
    - Pair 1: (6, 18) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 18:
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 19:
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
The total number of triangles in the graph is 0. 

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
