Response:
This problem requires us to find the number of triangles in the given graph.

Let's start by examining each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
  1. (4, 7) -> Triangle with nodes 0, 4, 7 <0, 4, 7>
  2. (4, 3) -> 0, 4, 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  3. (4, 6) -> Triangle with nodes 0, 4, 6 <0, 4, 6>
  4. (7, 3) -> 7, 0, 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  1. (8, 5) -> 1, 8, 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  2. (8, 6) -> 1, 8, 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  3. (8, 14) -> Triangle with nodes 1, 8, 14 <1, 8, 14>
  Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  1. (13, 6) -> Triangle with nodes 2, 13, 6 <2, 13, 6>
  2. (13, 14) -> 2, 13, 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  3. (13, 3) -> 2, 13, 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  1. (0, 12) -> Triangle with nodes 0, 3, 12 <0, 3, 12>
  2. (2, 13) -> Triangle with nodes 2, 13, 3 <2, 13, 3>
  3. (2, 6) -> Triangle with nodes 2, 6, 12 <2, 6, 12>
  Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
  1. (7, 13) -> Triangle with nodes 4, 7, 13 <4, 7, 13>
  2. (7, 0) -> Triangle with nodes 0, 4, 7 <0, 4, 7>
  3. (7, 14) -> Triangle with nodes 4, 7, 14 <4, 7, 14>
  4. (13, 14) -> 4, 13, 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
  1. (13, 8) -> Triangle with nodes 5, 13, 8 <5, 13, 8>
  2. (13, 11) -> Triangle with nodes 5, 13, 11 <5, 13, 11>
  3. (13, 10) -> 5, 13, 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for all remaining nodes,

* Node 6:
  * Total triangles: 2

* Node 7:
  * Total triangles: 3

* Node 8:
  * Total triangles: 2

* Node 9:
  * Total triangles: 0

* Node 10:
  * Total triangles: 1

* Node 11:
  * Total triangles: 2

* Node 12:
  * Total triangles: 3

* Node 13:
  * Total triangles: 3

* Node 14:
  * Total triangles: 3

Summing up all the triangles from each node, we get:
Total triangles = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 3 (Node 12) + 3 (Node 13) + 3 (Node 14) = 31

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [31].
