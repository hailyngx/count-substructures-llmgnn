Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 8

Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Connected to Node 4 and Node 6, which are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Also, Node 4 and Node 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Connected to Node 4 and Node 8, which are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Also, Node 4 and Node 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Node 5 and Node 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Node 5 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Node 7 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Connected to Node 4 and Node 7, which are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2. Also, Node 4 and Node 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Node 4 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip, no triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Node 5 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skip, as there are no pairs with at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
