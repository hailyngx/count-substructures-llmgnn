Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as (1, 2) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as (2, 7) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair involving smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pair involving smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pair involving smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 3 are also connected as (7, 3) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pair involving smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 8 and 9: Skipped because there are no pairs with larger nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Output: [6]
