Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
   * Pair 1: (10, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
   * Pair 2: (10, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
   * Pair 3: (10, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
   * Pair 4: (8, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
   * Pair 5: (8, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
   * Pair 6: (3, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
   * Pair 7: (12, 3) -> No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

2. **Node 1:**
   * Pair 1: (11, 7) -> No triangle formed.
   * Pair 2: (11, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
   * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
   * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. **Node 2:**
   * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed.
   * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
   * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
   * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
   * Pair 5: (5, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
   * Pair 6: (5, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
   * Pair 7: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
   * Pair 8: (13, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
   * Pair 9: (13, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
   * Pair 10: (12, 4) -> No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 5

4. **Node 3:**
   * Pair 1: (11, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
   * Pair 2: (11, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
   * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
   * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

5. **Node 4:**
   * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
   * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Rest of the nodes do not form at least two triangles with higher numbered nodes, so we skip them.

* Summarizing the triangles:
  * Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 5 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 17

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
