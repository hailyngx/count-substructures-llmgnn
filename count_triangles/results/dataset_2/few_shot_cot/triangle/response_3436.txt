Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 11: (10, 0) -> 10 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (11, 0) -> 11 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

The calculation process would continue for the remaining nodes as demonstrated in the example provided. Once triangles for all nodes are counted, the total number of triangles in the given graph will be determined.

Let's continue this process for the remaining nodes.
