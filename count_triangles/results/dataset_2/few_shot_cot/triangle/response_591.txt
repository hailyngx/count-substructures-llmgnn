Response:
Following the step-by-step process demonstrated earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are directly connected. Checking the final node: 1, 5, 0 form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Checking the final node: 8, 9, 1 form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7: 
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Checking the final node: 4, 9, 1 form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip the pairs involving Node 1 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
