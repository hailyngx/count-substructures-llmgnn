Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 1) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 3) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 1) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) - Connected in the graph. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<5, 4, 1>)

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no connected pairs.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) - Connected in the graph. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) - Connected in the graph. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) - Connected in the graph. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 7: (8, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (<5, 4, 3>, <4, 8, 3>, <4, 6, 3>)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed for these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
