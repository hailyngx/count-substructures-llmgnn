Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as the example provided above, here are the triangles for each node and the total count of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> Triangle <0, 4, 19>
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (16, 9) -> No triangle formed

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> Triangle <0, 4, 7>

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (6, 17) -> Triangle <6, 17, 5>

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Triangle <4, 7, 13>
    
* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (11, 2) -> No triangle formed

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (18, 12) -> No triangle formed

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3
* Unique triangles are <0, 4, 19>, <4, 7, 13>, and <6, 17, 5>.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
