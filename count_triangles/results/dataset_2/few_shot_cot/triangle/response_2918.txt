Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are directly connected but not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are directly connected but not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 14 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 14, 13>.
    * Pair 6: (17, 13) -> 17 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 17 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 17, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as they contain nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they contain nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5 to 19:
    * Skipping pairs due to smaller numbered nodes. No triangles can be formed with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles found are: <2, 14, 13> and <2, 17, 13>.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
