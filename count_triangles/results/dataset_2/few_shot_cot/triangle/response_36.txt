Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the sample explanation provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 0 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 1 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
