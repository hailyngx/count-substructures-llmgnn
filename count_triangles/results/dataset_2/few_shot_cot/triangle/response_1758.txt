Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 0 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 8 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 7 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 6 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
