Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.

    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * The only pair we could consider is (13, 18), but since 13 is smaller than 18, this pair is skipped.

    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 8.
