Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same process described in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Now, we have found all the triangles that include nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3. Let's continue the process for the remaining nodes.

[<7, 1, 2>, <5, 9, 7>, <9, 7, 0>, <4, 3, 1>, <4, 3, 6>] = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
