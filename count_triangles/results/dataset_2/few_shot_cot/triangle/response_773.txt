Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 28) -> Both 11 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 22) -> Both 11 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 11) and (0, 22) are in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
