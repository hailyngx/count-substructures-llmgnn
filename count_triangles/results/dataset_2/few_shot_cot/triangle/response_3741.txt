    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 11) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
