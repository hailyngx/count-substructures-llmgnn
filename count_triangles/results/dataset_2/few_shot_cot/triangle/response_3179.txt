Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (22, 27) -> 22 and 27 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 23) -> 22 and 23 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (27, 23) -> 27 and 23 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (17, 27) -> 17 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 20) -> 17 and 20 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 22) -> 17 and 22 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (20, 22) -> 20 and 22 are connected, but 20 and 22 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 21) -> 7 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 21) -> 8 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (16, 22) -> 16 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 26) -> 16 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 3) -> 16 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (22, 26) -> 22 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 29) -> 6 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (13, 24) -> 13 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7 to Node 29:
    * All these nodes have fewer than two nodes greater than them, so no triangles can be formed with them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
