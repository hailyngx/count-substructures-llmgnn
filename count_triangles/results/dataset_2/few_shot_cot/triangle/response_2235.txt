Response:
Following the step-by-step method to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (9, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (9, 4) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
