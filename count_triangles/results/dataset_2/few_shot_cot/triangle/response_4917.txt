Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's start counting the triangles for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 1 are also directly connected.
        * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also directly connected.
        * Pair 4: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 1 are also directly connected.
        * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 8: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 9: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 10: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected.
        * Pair 8: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 9: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 10: (13, 9) -> 13 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    Continue this process for Nodes 4 to 19 and sum up the total number of triangles at the end.
