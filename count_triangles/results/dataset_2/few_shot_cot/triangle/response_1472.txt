Response:
Following the same approach as previously explained, let's count the triangles step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle <0, 4, 9> formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle <2, 3, 5> formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> Triangle <2, 3, 12> formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> Triangle <3, 12, 14> formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes with smaller numbers.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes with smaller numbers.
    * Half of the adjacent nodes have been already analyzed with Node 2 and Node 3.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Triangle <8, 7, 11> formed.
    * No other valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> Triangle <0, 9, 13> formed.
    * No other valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
