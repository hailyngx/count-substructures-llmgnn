Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 since it is smaller than Node 1.
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    - Pair 6: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 4 are also connected as (5, 4) in the edge list.
    - Pair 7: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 4 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 3, 4, or 5 since they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are also connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 since they are smaller than 3.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, 5, and 6:
    - Skipped due to smaller numbered nodes that have already been processed.

* Node 7:
    - No pairs left to form triangles with Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 3 since they are smaller than 8.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 9 are also connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8 since they are smaller than 9.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
