Response:
Following the method described in the example, I will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected (4, 7) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (16, 26) -> 16 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (10, 24) -> 10 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected (10, 24) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected (9, 13) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (0, 15) -> 0 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected (0, 15) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 27) -> 7 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected (0, 9) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected (7, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected (5, 15) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected (4, 13) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected (7, 9) in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (9, 25) -> 9 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (2, 25) -> 2 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Given the above calculations, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 2] = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
