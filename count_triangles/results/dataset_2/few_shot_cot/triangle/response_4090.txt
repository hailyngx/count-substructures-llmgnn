Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3, and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - 4, and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) - 4, and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 13) - 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) - 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) - 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) - 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) - 0 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) - 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) - 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 11) - 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) - 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) - 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 12) - 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Moving on to Nodes 6-14:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) - 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) - 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 8) - 13 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) - 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (12, 4) - 12 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than their respective node numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
