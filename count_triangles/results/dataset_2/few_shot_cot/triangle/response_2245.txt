Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, here is the breakdown of counting triangles for each node in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> Not connected
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not connected
    * Pair 3: (19, 25) -> Not connected
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    No connections, so no triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Not connected
    * Pair 2: (9, 20) -> Not connected
    * Pair 3: (9, 28) -> Not connected
    * Pair 4: (13, 20) -> Not connected
    * Pair 5: (13, 28) -> Not connected
