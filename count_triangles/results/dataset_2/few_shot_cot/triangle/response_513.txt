Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 8, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 0

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 1 are also connected as (7, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 6 are also connected as (7, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Continue the same process as Node 0 and count the total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Continue the same process as Node 0 but skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.

* Node 3 - Node 9: Follow the steps for each of these nodes.

After calculating the triangles for all nodes, sum up the total triangles counted for each node.

Finally, provide the total number of triangles in the graph inside brackets [] along with the unique triangles found <...>.
