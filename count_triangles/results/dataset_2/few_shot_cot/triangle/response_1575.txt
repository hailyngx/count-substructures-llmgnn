Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 14 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 4) -> 14 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 14 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for Nodes 4 to 14. 

After calculating the triangles for each node, calculate the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles found using the smallest numbered node for each triangle.

Finally, output the final answer inside brackets [].

In the meantime, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph.
