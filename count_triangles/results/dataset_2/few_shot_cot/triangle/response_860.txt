Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (11, 5) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (12, 5) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (11, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (15, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed as all pairs include smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (17, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (17, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (10, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (19, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangle can be formed as all pairs include smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No triangle can be formed as all pairs include smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (18, 17) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No triangle can be formed as all pairs include smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No triangle can be formed as all pairs include smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No triangle can be formed as all pairs include smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No triangle can be formed as all pairs include smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No triangle can be formed as all pairs include smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No triangle can be formed as all pairs include smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles by adding triangles formed with each node as the smallest numbered node: 
0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) 
= 0

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
