Response:
Following the process described in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 13). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (8, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (14, 4) -> 14 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (14, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
