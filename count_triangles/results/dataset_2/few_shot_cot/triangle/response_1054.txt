Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the initial example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

1. Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are considered first as they have at least two higher-numbered neighbors.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 19) - Both 1 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 26) - Both 1 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 26) - Both 19 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 23) - Both 15 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 0) - Both 15 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (23, 0) - Both 23 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (25, 24) - Both 25 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (21, 11) - Both 21 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (21, 11) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 5) - Both 21 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (21, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 5) - Both 11 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) - Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (13, 14) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 9) - Both 13 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (29, 3) - Both 29 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (29, 2) - Both 29 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) - Both 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (22, 28) - Both 22 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (22, 28) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (21, 25) - Both 21 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (21, 25) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 26) - Both 21 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (21, 26) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (20, 28) - Both 20 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (20, 28) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (20, 19) - Both 20 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (20, 19) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Now, let's continue the process for the remaining nodes 9 to 29.
