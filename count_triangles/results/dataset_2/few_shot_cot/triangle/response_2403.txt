Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 6) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 12) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 13) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 6) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (12, 13) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (12, 6) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (13, 6) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 12) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 6) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 2) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 6) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 2) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 2) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 7) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 8) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 12) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 2) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 2) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 7) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 7) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 0) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 12) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 12) -> Not a triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
