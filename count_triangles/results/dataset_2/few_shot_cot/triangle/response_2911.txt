Response:
Following the instruction provided in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that involve smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangle involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that involve smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangle involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangle involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that involve smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangle involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that involve smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangle involving Node 9.

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * No possible triangles with nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
