Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Nodes 2 and 3 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> Nodes 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> Nodes 2 and 12 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (3, 10) -> Nodes 3 and 10 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (3, 12) -> Nodes 3 and 12 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (10, 12) -> Nodes 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 10.
  * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 11.
  * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 12.
  * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 13.
  * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 14.
  * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
