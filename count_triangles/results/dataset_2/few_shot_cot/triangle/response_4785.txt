Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (13, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (13, 19) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (19, 3) -> 19 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (9, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (6, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (12, 17) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they are not part of any triangle in the given graph.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as (12, 16) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are connected as (5, 11, 18) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as they are not part of any triangle in the given graph.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
