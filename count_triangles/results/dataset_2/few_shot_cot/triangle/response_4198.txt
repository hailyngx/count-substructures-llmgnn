Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 10) - Both 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 2) - Both 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (10, 2) - Both 10 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (8, 13) - Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 10) - Both 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 2) - Both 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (8, 12) - Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (13, 12) - Both 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (0, 14) - Both 0 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 1) - Both 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 14) - Both 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 1) - Both 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (14, 1) - Both 14 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 14) - Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 10) - Both 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 0) - Both 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (14, 0) - Both 14 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (14, 10) - Both 14 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
    - Continue this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

After completing the process for each node, add up the total number of triangles formed by each node as the smallest numbered node to find the total number of triangles in the graph. Provide the final answer inside brackets.
