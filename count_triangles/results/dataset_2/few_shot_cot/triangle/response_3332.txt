Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle found: <0, 2, 7>.

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle found: <1, 2, 3>.

- Node 2:
  - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
  - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle found: <2, 5, 14>.
  - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle found: <2, 8, 9>.
  - Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle found: <2, 14, 5>.

- Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle found: <1, 3, 4>.
  
- Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.

- Node 5:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle found: <5, 14, 4>.

- Node 6:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.

- Node 7:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.

- Node 8:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.

- Node 9:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.

- Node 10:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.

- Node 11:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 10 as they are smaller than 11.

- Node 12:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 11 as they are smaller than 12.

- Node 13:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 12 as they are smaller than 13.

- Node 14:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 13 as they are smaller than 14.

Summarizing the triangles found:
[<0, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 3>, <2, 5, 14>, <2, 8, 9>, <2, 14, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <5, 14, 4>]

Therefore, there are 7 unique triangles in the given graph.
