Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the provided information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) - Node 2, 0, and 9 form a triangle <0, 2, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (2, 12) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (3, 9) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 7: (3, 10) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 8: (5, 9) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as smaller nodes do not form triangles with 1.
    * No triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Skipped as smaller nodes do not form triangles with 5.
    * No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as there is only one neighbor.
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skipped as smaller nodes do not form triangles with 7.
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
