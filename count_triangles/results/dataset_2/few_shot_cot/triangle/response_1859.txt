Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the graph. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (Triangles: <0, 2, 7> and <0, 5, 6>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (Triangles: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, and <1, 4, 6>)

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected in the graph. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <0, 2, 6>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the graph. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <1, 3, 4>)

* Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    No other nodes left to form triangles with these nodes. 

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
