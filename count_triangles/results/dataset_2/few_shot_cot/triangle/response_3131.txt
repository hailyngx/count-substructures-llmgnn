Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Following the same steps as in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
