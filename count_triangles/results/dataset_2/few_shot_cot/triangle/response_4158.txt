Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 10 are directly connected as (5, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 14 are directly connected as (5, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 10 and 14 are directly connected as (10, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 13 are directly connected as (8, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 12 are directly connected as (8, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 12 and 13 are directly connected as (12, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 12 are directly connected as (8, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[<5, 10, 14>, <8, 12, 13>]

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
