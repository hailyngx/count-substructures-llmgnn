Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by calculating triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes with smaller numbers than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 14) -> 19 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped since there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than their respective node numbers.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
