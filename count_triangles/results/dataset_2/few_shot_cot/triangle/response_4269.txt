Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as (1, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No valid triangles as 4 does not have enough larger numbered neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 by examining all possible pairs based on their adjacency, we find the total number of triangles.

* Total triangles in the graph: [10]

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 6, 14>, <1, 5, 2>, <2, 5, 13>, <2, 5, 1>, <3, 9, 11>, <5, 13, 6>, <9, 11, 3>, <13, 6, 5>.
