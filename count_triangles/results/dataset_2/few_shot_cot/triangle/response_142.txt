Response:
Following the step-by-step method from the example provided:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Nodes 9 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 19) -> Nodes 9 and 19 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (12, 19) -> Nodes 12 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip pairs as no other nodes with greater numbers than 1 are connected to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (11, 25) -> Nodes 11 and 25 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 10) -> Nodes 1 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Nodes 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 18) -> Nodes 1 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (10, 5) -> Nodes 10 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 5: (10, 18) -> Nodes 10 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 6: (5, 18) -> Nodes 5 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs as no other nodes with greater numbers than 4 are connected to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip pairs as no other nodes with greater numbers than 5 are connected to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6 to 29:
    - Skip all these nodes as there aren't at least two nodes greater than them connected to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6-29) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
