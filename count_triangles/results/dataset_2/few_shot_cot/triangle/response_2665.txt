Response:
Following the same step-by-step process to count triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (1, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes, so no valid pairs exist to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (8, 17) in the edge list.
    * No other valid pairs exist to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* The process has to continue for the remaining nodes in the graph to find all the triangles. Let's continue with Nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) - 6 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (6, 15) in the edge list.
    * No other valid pairs exist to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes, as there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as (0, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 16) -> 0 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as (1, 16) in the edge list.
    * No other valid pairs exist to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes, as there are no nodes greater than 6 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 will help find all the triangles in the graph.

Summarizing the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 3 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
