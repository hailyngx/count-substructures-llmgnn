Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected to node 0, and they are also directly connected to each other as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are connected to node 1, and they are also directly connected to each other as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are connected to node 1, but they are not directly connected according to the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 27) -> 0 and 27 are connected to node 1, but they are not directly connected according to the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are connected to node 1, but they are not directly connected according to the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are connected to node 1, but they are not directly connected according to the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 27) -> 12 and 27 are connected to node 1, but they are not directly connected according to the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (22, 10) -> 22 and 10 are connected to node 3, but they are not directly connected according to the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 7) -> 10 and 7 are connected to node 3, but they are not directly connected according to the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (21, 5) -> 21 and 5 are connected to node 4 and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Continuing the process for Nodes 10 through 29:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 10 through 29 as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
