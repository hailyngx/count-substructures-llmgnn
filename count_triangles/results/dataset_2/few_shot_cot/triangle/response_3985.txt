Response:
Following the process outlined in the example given, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> No triangle formed as 16 and 17 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (16, 12) -> No triangle formed as 16 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (16, 19) -> No triangle formed as 16 and 19 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (17, 12) -> No triangle formed as 17 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (17, 19) -> No triangle formed as 17 and 19 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (12, 19) -> Triangle formed as 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected (12, 19).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * The only pair possible is (15, 12), but since 15 is greater than 1, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs greater than their corresponding node numbers to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 18 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Triangle formed as 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected (5, 12).
    * Pair 3: (9, 18) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 18 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, and 12:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs greater than their corresponding node numbers to form triangles.

* Nodes 13, 14, and 15:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs greater than their corresponding node numbers to form triangles.

* Nodes 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs greater than their corresponding node numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
