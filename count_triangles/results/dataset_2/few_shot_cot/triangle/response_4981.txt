Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same process as in the example provided.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Triangle formed: <0, 6, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 4: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 10>.
    * Pair 7: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 14>.
    * Pair 9: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (14, 13) -> Triangle formed: <0, 13, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 10>.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 10) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 10>.
    * Pair 6: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 10>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Triangle formed: <3, 10, 0>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> Triangle formed: <4, 10, 0>.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> Triangle formed: <6, 10, 0>.
    * Pair 4: (0, 14) -> Triangle formed: <10, 14, 0>.
    * Pair 5: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 11.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 12.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 10) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
