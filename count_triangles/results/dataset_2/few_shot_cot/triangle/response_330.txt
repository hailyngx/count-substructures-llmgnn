* Node 13:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node, as there are not at least two nodes greater than 13 to form triangles.

* Node 14:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node, as there are not at least two nodes greater than 14 to form triangles.

* Node 15:

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
