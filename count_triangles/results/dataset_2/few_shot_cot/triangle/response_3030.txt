Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 23) -> 5 and 23 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (5, 23) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 20) -> 5 and 20 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (5, 20) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 11 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (23, 20) -> 23 and 20 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (23, 20) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (23, 11) -> 23 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (23, 11) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (20, 11) -> 20 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (20, 11) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0 because it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (17, 12) -> 17 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (10, 25) -> 10 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 22) -> 9 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 22 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 1 triangle
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 1 triangle
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 1 triangle
* Node 15: 1 triangle
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 0 triangles
* Node 22: 1 triangle
* Node 23: 1 triangle
* Node 24: 0 triangles
* Node 25: 0 triangles
* Node 26: 0 triangles
* Node 27: 1 triangle
* Node 28: 1 triangle
* Node 29: 2 triangles

Summarizing the triangles found for each node:
[0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 1 (Node 22) + 1 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 1 (Node 27) + 1 (Node 28) + 2 (Node 29)] = 11

Therefore, there are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph.
