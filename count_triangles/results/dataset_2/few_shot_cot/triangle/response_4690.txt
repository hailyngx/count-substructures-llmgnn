Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 15) -> 0 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 3.
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 5.
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 6 to 19:

* Node 6: 2 triangles
* Node 7: 1 triangle
* Node 8: 1 triangle
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 1 triangle
* Node 16: 1 triangle
* Node 17: 1 triangle
* Node 18: 1 triangle
* Node 19: 0 triangles

Finally, summing up the total number of triangles: 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 14.

Therefore, there are [14] triangles in the given graph.
