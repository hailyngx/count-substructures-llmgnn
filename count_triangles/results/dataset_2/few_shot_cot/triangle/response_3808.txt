Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles as there are no edges from Node 0 to any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as all pairs involve nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:

    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Passthrough Node in this step.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles as all pairs involve nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
