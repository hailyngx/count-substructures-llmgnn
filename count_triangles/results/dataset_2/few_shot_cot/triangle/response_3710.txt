Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example provided, we will now determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 29) -> Both 4 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 18) -> Both 4 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 26) -> Both 8 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> Both 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 29) -> Both 10 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Both 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 24) -> Both 7 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 3: (11, 24) -> Both 11 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 21) -> Both 8 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible pairs for triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (29, 28) -> Both 29 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 21) -> Both 3 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 4) -> Both 12 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Remaining Nodes:
    * Skipping nodes without possible triangle formation due to not having at least 2 greater numbered neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
