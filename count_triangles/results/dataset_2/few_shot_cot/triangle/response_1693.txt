Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph with 30 nodes:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 23) - Both 3 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (17, 28) - Both 17 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (17, 19) - Both 17 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (17, 3) - Both 17 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (2, 17) - Both 2 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (6, 24) - Both 6 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (9, 19) - Both 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (4, 24) - Both 4 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (15, 17) - Both 15 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (4, 24) - Both 4 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - Skip, no connected nodes to form a triangle.

This process will be continued for the remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's continue this process for all nodes and then sum up the total number of triangles present in the graph.
