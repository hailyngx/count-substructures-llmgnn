Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 10 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 14 and 19 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 14 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (19, 6) -> 19 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles involving 4 as the smallest numbered node exist.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 5: 0 triangles
* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 2 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 4 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 4 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 2 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles

Summing up the triangles for each node:
\[ 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 4 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 4 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 2 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 20 \]

Therefore, there are 20 triangles in the given graph.
\[ [20] \]
