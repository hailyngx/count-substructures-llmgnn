Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6)

Response:
Following the same approach as before, we will now count the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are connected in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are connected in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (2, 1) -> 1 and 2 are connected in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> 1 and 3 are connected in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> 0 and 3 are connected in the edge list.
  * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected in the edge list.
  * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

- Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 3 and 4 are connected in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are connected in the edge list.
  * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 5:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are connected in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are connected in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are connected in the edge list.
  * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected in the edge list.
  * Pair 5: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are connected in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 4

- Node 7:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 4 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph. [15]
