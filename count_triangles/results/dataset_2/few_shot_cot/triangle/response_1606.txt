Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (18, 28) -> Forms a triangle with Node 25: <18, 25, 28>.
    * Pair 2: (18, 25) -> Both neighbors of Node 0 but not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (18, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 28: <0, 18, 28>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 21) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14: <1, 14, 21>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 25: <1, 11, 25>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 21: <1, 14, 21>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both neighbors of Node 2 but not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15: <2, 12, 15>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <2, 5, 15>.
    * Pair 4: (2, 20) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13: <2, 13, 20>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with only one connection.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with only one connection.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 21) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <1, 5, 21>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 22: <5, 10, 22>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 22) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16: <5, 16, 22>.
    * Pair 4: (5, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17: <5, 15, 17>.
    * Pair 5: (5, 27) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16: <5, 16, 27>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with only two connections.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 21) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13: <7, 13, 21>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 29) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8: <7, 8, 29>.
    * Pair 3: (7, 24) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14: <7, 14, 24>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 28) -> Forms a triangle with Node 23: <8, 23, 28>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 29) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17: <8, 17, 29>.
    * Pair 3: (8, 22) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16: <8, 16, 22>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 25: <9, 11, 25>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <6, 9, 18>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 26) -> Forms a triangle with Node 23: <10, 23, 26>.
    * Pair 2: (10, 24) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15: <10, 15, 24>.
    * Pair 3: (10, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 22: <5, 10, 22>.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 11:
    * No new triangles found since all connected nodes have been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes may take a lot of time. Let's summarize the triangles found so far and continue the calculation for the remaining nodes.

* Total triangles found: 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 5 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 3 (Node 10) = 24

Let's continue the calculations for the remaining nodes and provide the final answer.
