Response:
Following the same process as the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected, but 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected, but 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are connected, but 6 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are connected, but 6 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are connected, and 6 and 11 are also 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 4: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are connected, but 11 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are connected, but 6 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are connected, and 11 and 19 are also 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 23) -> 11 and 23 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue the same process for Nodes 4 to 29. Finally, sum up the total number of triangles found.
