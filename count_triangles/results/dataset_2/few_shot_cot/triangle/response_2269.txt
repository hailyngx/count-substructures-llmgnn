Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the graph given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 21) -> 14 and 21 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip, no pairs to consider for triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 22) -> 7 and 22 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (26, 25) -> 26 and 25 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 23) -> 10 and 23 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 10 to 29, we find:

* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 1 triangle <14, 27, 17>
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 0 triangles
* Node 22: 0 triangles
* Node 23: 0 triangles
* Node 24: 0 triangles
* Node 25: 0 triangles
* Node 26: 0 triangles
* Node 27: 0 triangles
* Node 28: 0 triangles
* Node 29: 1 triangle <18, 29, 16>

Adding up all the triangles found for each node results in the total number of triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [2].
