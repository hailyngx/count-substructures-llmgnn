Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the sample explanation, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 4: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 5: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 6: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes: 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes: 0 and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes: 0, 1, and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes: 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 8.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.

    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 8) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
