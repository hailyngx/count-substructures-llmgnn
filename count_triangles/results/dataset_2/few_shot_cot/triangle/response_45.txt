* Node 3:
    * Triangle: <3, 6, 17>

* Node 4:
    * Triangle: <4, 7, 22>

* Node 5:
    * Triangle: <5, 16, 23>

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Triangle: <4, 7, 22>

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
