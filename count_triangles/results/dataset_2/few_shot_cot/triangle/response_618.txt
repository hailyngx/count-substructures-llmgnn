Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: [<0, 8, 14>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 14>, <4, 8, 10>, <3, 8, 14>]

The final answer is [6].
