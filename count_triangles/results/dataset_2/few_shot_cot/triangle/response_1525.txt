Response:
Following the same methodology as the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph given:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3
        - <0, 1, 4>
        - <0, 4, 6>
        - <0, 6, 9>

2. **Node 1:**
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        - <2, 4, 5>

4. **Node 3:**
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2
        - <3, 6, 13>
        - <3, 11, 14>

5. **Node 4:**
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2
        - <4, 7, 5>
        - <4, 7, 13>

6. **Node 5:**
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2
        - <6, 13, 3>
        - <6, 14, 11>

8. **Node 7:**
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2
        - <7, 4, 13>
        - <7, 13, 6>

9. **Node 8:**
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        - <9, 10, 14>

11. **Node 10:**
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. **Node 11:**
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. **Node 12:**
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. **Node 13:**
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        - <13, 6, 3>

15. **Node 14:**
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 4
        - <14, 3, 6>
        - <14, 3, 11>
        - <14, 6, 13>
        - <14, 9, 10>

Calculating the final count of triangles by summing up the triangles from all nodes:

[3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 4 (Node 14)] = 18

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [18].
