Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are connected as (0, 3), forming a triangle with Node 5 as the third node.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are connected as (0, 5), forming a triangle with Node 7 as the third node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are connected as (1, 2), forming a triangle with Node 4 as the third node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected as (2, 4), forming a triangle with Node 1 as the third node.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected as (2, 5), forming a triangle with Node 0 as the third node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected as (3, 6), forming a triangle with Node 9 as the third node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected as (4, 8), forming a triangle with Node 7 as the third node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6), forming a triangle with Node 3 as the third node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8), forming a triangle with Node 4 as the third node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 2>
<2, 4, 1>
<2, 4, 5>
<5, 6, 3>
<4, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 4>
<7, 8, 4>
