Following the same method as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Indicates that a triangle is already counted with 2 as the smallest node, so this pair is skipped.

    * Pair 6: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Indicates that a triangle is already counted with 1 as the smallest node, so this pair is skipped.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 13) -> Indicates that a triangle is already counted with 1 as the smallest node, so this pair is skipped.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Indicates that a triangle is already counted with 2 as the smallest node, so this pair is skipped.

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * These nodes have fewer than 2 nodes greater than them, so they won't form triangles with the given conditions.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
