Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 0 as there are no pairs of neighbors connected to each other directly.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1 with (9, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2 with (9, 11) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3 with (5, 11) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4 with (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes, the remaining pairs do not form any triangles involving Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1 with (29, 18) - No triangle formed.
