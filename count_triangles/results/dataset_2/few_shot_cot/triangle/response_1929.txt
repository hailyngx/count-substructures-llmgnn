Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because all other nodes are smaller.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
