Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as 2 is one of the smallest nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as 5 is one of the smallest nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as 8 is one of the smallest nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (10, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No pairs to consider as 10 is one of the smallest nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
