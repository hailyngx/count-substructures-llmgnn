Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Nodes 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> Nodes 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 11) -> Nodes 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 12) -> Nodes 5 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Nodes 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> Nodes 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> Nodes 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 4: (10, 13) -> Nodes 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Nodes 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> Nodes 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> Nodes 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> Nodes 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Nodes 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 3: (10, 13) -> Nodes 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Nodes 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> Nodes 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

Now, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to find all possible triangles and calculate the total count.
