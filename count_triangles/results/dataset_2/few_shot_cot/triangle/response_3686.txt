Response:
Following the instructions provided in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Form a triangle with node 8: <0, 1, 8>
    - Pair 2: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (14, 15) -> Form a triangle with node 14: <1, 14, 15>
    - Pair 2: (14, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (15, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 14) -> Form a triangle with node 7: <2, 7, 14>
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (10, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (12, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (11, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (9, 17) -> Form a triangle with node 9: <7, 9, 17>
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (0, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (7, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (0, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 11 to 19:
    - Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
