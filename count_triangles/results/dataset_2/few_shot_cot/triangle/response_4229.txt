Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are directly connected as (0, 4) is in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are directly connected as (0, 7) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are directly connected as (0, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as (3, 6) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected as (3, 7) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected as (6, 9) is in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
