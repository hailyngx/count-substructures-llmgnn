Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No edge between 1 and 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No edge between 1 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> Node 0 is not connected to 11. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 14) -> Node 0 is connected to 1 and 14, but there is no direct edge between 1 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> No edge between 3 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 11) -> Node 0 is not connected to 11. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 12) -> No edge between 3 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 14) -> Node 0 is connected to 6 and 14, but there is no direct edge between 6 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Proceed in a similar manner for all remaining nodes following the same steps as done for Node 0:
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Calculating the number of triangles with node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Calculating the number of triangles with node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Calculating the number of triangles with node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Calculating the number of triangles with node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <5, 0, 7>)

* Node 6:
    * Calculating the number of triangles with node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Calculating the number of triangles with node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * Skip these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 5)
Therefore, there is **1** triangle in the given graph.
