Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
