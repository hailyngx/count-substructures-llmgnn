Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip.
    
* Node 1:
    * Skip.
    
* Node 2:
    * Skip.
    
* Node 3:
    * Skip.
    
* Node 4:
    * Skip.
    
* Node 5:
    * Skip.
    
* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - Node 9 and Node 1 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) - Node 9 and Node 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip.
    
* Node 8:
    * Skip.
    
* Node 9:
    * Skip.
    
* Node 10:
    * Skip.
    
* Node 11:
    * Skip.
    
* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) - Node 3 and Node 10 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 12, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip.
    
* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (17, 10) - Node 17 and Node 10 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 14, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Skip.

* Node 16:
    * Skip.

* Node 17:
    * Skip.

* Node 18:
    * Skip.

* Node 19:
    * Skip.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
