Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.

    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 1: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as all other nodes are smaller than these nodes, and there aren't at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 9

**[9]**

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 7, 0>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 10>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 10, 14>, <6, 9, 4>, <6, 14, 10>.
