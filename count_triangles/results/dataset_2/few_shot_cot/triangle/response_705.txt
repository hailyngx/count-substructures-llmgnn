Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Pair 1: (17, 12) -> 17 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 as they are smaller than 13.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, and Node 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are as follows: 
<1, 6, 0>, <1, 11, 0>, <7, 17, 3>, <17, 12, 11>, <9, 13, 12>
