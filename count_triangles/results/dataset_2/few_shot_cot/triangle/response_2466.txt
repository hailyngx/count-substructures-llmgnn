Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example above, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [4].
