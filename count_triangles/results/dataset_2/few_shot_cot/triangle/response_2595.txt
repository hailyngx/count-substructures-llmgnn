    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> Triangle formed: <6, 10, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 6 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) = 29

Therefore, there are 29 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [29].
