Response:
Following the same method as shown in the previous example, calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 0, 8) is a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are connected as (7, 0, 19) is a triangle.
    * No more pairs to consider with node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are connected as (10, 1, 18) is a triangle.
    * No more pairs to consider with node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are connected as (10, 4, 15) is a triangle.
    * No more pairs to consider with node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 7, 17) is a triangle.
    * No more pairs to consider with node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are connected as (9, 6, 15) is a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are connected as (10, 6, 15) is a triangle.
    * No more pairs to consider with node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are connected as (5, 17, 7) is a triangle.
    * No more pairs to consider with node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are connected as (0, 7, 17) is a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs to consider with node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are connected as (4, 10, 15) is a triangle.
    * No more pairs to consider with node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with node 12.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are connected as (13, 14, 9) is a triangle.
    * No more pairs to consider with node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with node 14.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with node 15.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with node 16.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are connected as (7, 17, 16) is a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are connected as (7, 17, 19) is a triangle.
    * No more pairs to consider with node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with node 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 17) = 16.

Therefore, there are [16] triangles in the given graph.
