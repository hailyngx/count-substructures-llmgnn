Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the new graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are connected as (3, 0) and (0, 14) shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are directly connected as (4, 10) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (7, 11) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are connected as (7, 1) and (1, 14) shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (11, 13) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are directly connected as (4, 10) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are directly connected as (6, 11) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 5 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
