* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (16, 4) -> 16 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 15) -> 16 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as there is only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * No pairs to consider as there is only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No pairs to consider as there is only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (12, 4) -> 12 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 16, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.

    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
