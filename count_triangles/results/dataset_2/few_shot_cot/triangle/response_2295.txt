Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 8

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are connected to node 0, but they are not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of node 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No triangle involves Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No triangle involves Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No triangle involves Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No triangle involves Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 8 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 8 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 1) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of node 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, which is the triangle <1, 2, 5>.

The final answer is [1].
