Response:
Following the step-by-step process demonstrated in the first example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (25, 22) -> 25 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skipping other pairs involving nodes smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (25, 24) -> 25 and 24 are connected, satisfying the triangle condition with 1.
    * Skipping other pairs involving nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 20) -> 13 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skipping other pairs involving nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs involving nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (19, 24) -> 19 and 24 are connected, satisfying the triangle condition with 4.
    * Pair 2: (19, 21) -> 19 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected.
    * Skipping other pairs involving nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skipping other pairs involving nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 28) -> 6 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skipping other pairs involving nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are connected, satisfying the triangle condition with 7.
    * Skipping other pairs involving nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (15, 8) -> 15 and 8 are connected, satisfying the triangle condition with 8.
    * Skipping other pairs involving nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1
