Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node in the graph, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph.

Here are the calculations for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 13.
    * Pair 2: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Pair 4: (6, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 5: (13, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 15.
    * Pair 2: (6, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) -> Triangle formed with Node 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (13, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (16, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> Triangle formed with Node 10.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> Triangle formed with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 2 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 17.

Therefore, there are [17] triangles in the given graph.
