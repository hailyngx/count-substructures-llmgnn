Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, we will now find the number of triangles in the graph and list the unique triangles found:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (10, 14). Triangle formed.
    * No more possible pairs to consider for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 14). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (12, 14). Triangle formed.
    * No more possible pairs to consider for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (0, 5). Triangle formed.
    * No more possible pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (4, 14). Triangle formed.
    * No more possible pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

I will continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8, and provide the final count of triangles once completed.
