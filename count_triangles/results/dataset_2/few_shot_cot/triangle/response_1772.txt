Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 3) -> 10 and 3 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, connected as (7, 17), triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (17, 11) -> 17 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* For Nodes 8 to 19, no triangles are formed because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 4)
Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
