Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are linked as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not linked in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> Already considered when looking at Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Already considered when looking at Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Already considered when looking at Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> Already considered when looking at Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 13. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 14. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
