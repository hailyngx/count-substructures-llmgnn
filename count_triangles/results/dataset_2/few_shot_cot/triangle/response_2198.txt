* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles as there is only one connected node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No triangles possible as there are no other nodes greater than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No triangles possible as there are no other nodes greater than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13: 
    * No triangles possible as there are no other nodes greater than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14: 
    * No triangles possible as there are no other nodes greater than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph. 

The final answer is [0].
