Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, here is the calculation for the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (16, 9) -> 16 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (17, 9) -> 17 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11, 12, 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (16, 2) -> 16 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15, 16, 17, 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
