Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 12.

        Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
