Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 23) -> 6 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 4: (6, 29) -> 6 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 23) -> 9 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 29) -> 9 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (23, 14) -> 23 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (23, 29) -> 23 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (14, 29) -> 14 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (Triangles <6, 0, 14> and <6, 0, 29>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <4, 1, 16>)

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (17, 3) -> 17 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <5, 2, 17>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <11, 3, 12>)

* Remaining nodes do not form triangles as the remaining pairs involve nodes smaller than themselves.

Combining the total triangles from each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
