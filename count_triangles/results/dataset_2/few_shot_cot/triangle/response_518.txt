Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as demonstrated in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
