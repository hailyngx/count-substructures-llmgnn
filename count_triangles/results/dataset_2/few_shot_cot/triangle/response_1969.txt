Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with them as the other nodes connected to them are smaller.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed as 10 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> No triangle formed as 11 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> No triangle formed as 12 and 16 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 2 nodes greater than 13.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> No triangle formed as 14 and 15 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 15, 16, 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with them as the other nodes connected to them are smaller.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> No triangle formed as 18 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1 node greater than 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
