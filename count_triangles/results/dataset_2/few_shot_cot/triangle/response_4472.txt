Response:
Following the method described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 23) -> 14 and 23 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are connected. Continue to check if they are connected to each other.
    * Pair 3: (19, 23) -> 19 and 23 are connected. Check if they are connected to complete the triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No more potential triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are connected. Continue to check if they are connected to each other.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are connected. Check if they are connected to complete the triangle.
