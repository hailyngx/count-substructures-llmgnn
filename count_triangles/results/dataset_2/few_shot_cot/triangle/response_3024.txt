Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) - Nodes 0 and 1 are connected, forming a line.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) - Nodes 0 and 5 are connected, forming a line.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Nodes 2 and 3 are connected, forming a line.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Nodes 4 and 6 are connected, forming a line.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - Nodes 4 and 7 are connected, forming a line.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - Nodes 4 and 9 are connected, forming a line.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0.

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
