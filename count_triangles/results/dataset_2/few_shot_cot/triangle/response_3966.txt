Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

***Calculating the triangles for each node:***

* Node 0:
    * <1, 7, 9> -> 1, 7, and 9 are all connected to 0 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * <0, 7, 9> -> 0, 7, and 9 are all connected to 1 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * <0, 4, 9> -> 0, 4, and 9 are all connected to 2 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * <4, 8, 9> -> 4, 8, and 9 are all connected to 3 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * <5, 6, 8> -> 5, 6, and 8 are all connected to 4 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * <4, 6, 8> -> 4, 6, and 8 are all connected to 5 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * <4, 5, 3> -> 4, 5, and 3 are all connected to 6 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * <0, 1, 9> -> 0, 1, and 9 are all connected to 7 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * <4, 5, 0> -> 4, 5, and 0 are all connected to 8 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * <0, 2, 7> -> 0, 2, and 7 are all connected to 9 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0. 

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
