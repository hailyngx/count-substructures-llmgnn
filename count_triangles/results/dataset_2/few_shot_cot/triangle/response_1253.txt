Response:
Following the step-by-step process, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No edge exists between 1 and 3.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> There is an edge between 1 and 4.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> No edge exists between 1 and 2.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No edge exists between 1 and 8.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> No edge exists between 3 and 4.
    * Pair 6: (3, 2) -> No edge exists between 3 and 2.
    * Pair 7: (3, 8) -> There is an edge between 3 and 8.
    * Pair 8: (4, 2) -> No edge exists between 4 and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No edge exists between 4 and 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> There is an edge between 4 and 9.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> There is an edge between 4 and 1.
    * Pair 4: (4, 0) -> There is an edge between 4 and 0.
    * Pair 5: (7, 5) -> There is an edge between 7 and 5.
    * Pair 6: (7, 6) -> There is an edge between 7 and 6.
    * Pair 7: (7, 2) -> There is an edge between 7 and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> There is an edge between 7 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
