Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are: <3, 4, 6>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 7>.

So, the final answer is [6].
