Response:
Following the instructions from the provided example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Triangle formed with node 2 and 4.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) - Triangle formed with node 4 and 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) - Triangle formed with node 0 and 3.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) - Triangle formed with node 0 and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) - Triangle formed with node 0 and 2.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 17) - Triangle formed with node 2 and 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) - Triangle formed with node 9 and 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No pairs can be considered with nodes greater than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (18, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No pairs can be considered with nodes greater than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) - Triangle formed with node 4 and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * No pairs can be considered with nodes greater than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No pairs can be considered with nodes greater than 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No pairs can be considered with nodes greater than 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) - Triangle formed with node 4 and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:
    * No pairs can be considered with nodes greater than 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
