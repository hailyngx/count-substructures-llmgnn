Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 2) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 16) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 0) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 0) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 6) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 18) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 18) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 1) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 0) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 0) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 12) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Nodes 9-19) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
