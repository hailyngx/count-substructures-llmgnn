Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 1) -> 16 and 1 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are connected, forming a pair with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are connected, forming a pair with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 16, 19>

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs related to Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs related to Node 0 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Skip all pairs related to Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are connected, forming a pair with Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are connected, forming a pair with Node 2.
    * Pair 4: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (15, 3) -> 15 and 3 are connected, forming a pair with Node 2.
    * Pair 6: (19, 3) -> 19 and 3 are connected, forming a pair with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3
    * Unique triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 9, 19>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 19>

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are connected, but they are smaller than Node 3. No triangle formed.
    * More pairs do not exist to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * More pairs do not exist to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs related to Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are connected, but they are smaller than Node 5. No triangle formed.
    * More pairs do not exist to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are connected, forming a pair with Node 6.
    * More pairs do not exist to form triangles with Node 6.

* Continue this process for Nodes 7 to 19 in a similar manner.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total number of triangles: 4
* Unique triangles: <0, 16, 19>, <2, 9, 19>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 19>

Therefore, the final answer within brackets is [4].
