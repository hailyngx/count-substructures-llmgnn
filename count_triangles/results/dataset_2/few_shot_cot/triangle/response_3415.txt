Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided for counting triangles in a graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (19, 20) -> 19 and 20 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 23) -> 7 and 23 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 29) -> 3 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: No pairs to consider as 5 is not connected to any nodes that could form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (27, 23) -> 27 and 23 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: No pairs to consider as 8 is not connected to any nodes that could form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: No pairs to consider as 10 is not connected to any nodes that could form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11 to 29:
    * Following the same process for each node from 11 to 29, no triangles are found with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Nodes 11 to 29) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
