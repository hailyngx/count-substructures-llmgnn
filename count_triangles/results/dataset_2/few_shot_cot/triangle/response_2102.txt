Response:
Following the same process as in the example with step-by-step triangle counting for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 18) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 3) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are connected. 3 and 18 are connected with 2 as well. Triangle formed <2, 3, 18>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 16) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 15) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are connected. 7 and 12 are connected with 3 as well. Triangle formed <3, 7, 12>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are connected. 7 and 2 are connected with 3 as well. Triangle formed <2, 3, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are connected. 8 and 5 are connected with 4 as well. Triangle formed <4, 5, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are connected. 8 and 6 are connected with 4 as well. Triangle formed <4, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (15, 9) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 11) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are connected. 11 and 13 are connected with 7 as well. Triangle formed <7, 11, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (11, 7) -> Not considered as 7 is smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue the process for nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 2 (Node 19) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
