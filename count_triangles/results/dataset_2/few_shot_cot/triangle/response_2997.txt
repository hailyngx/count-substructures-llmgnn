Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected as there is no edge (3, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are not connected as there is no edge (3, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are connected as (4, 12) in the edge list and also 1-hop neighbors of 0 forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list and also 1-hop neighbors of 1 forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list and also 1-hop neighbors of 2 forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list and also 1-hop neighbors of 3 forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are connected as (8, 11) in the edge list and also 1-hop neighbors of 8 forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list and also 1-hop neighbors of 9 forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are connected as (4, 0) in the edge list and also 1-hop neighbors of 12 forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 as they are smaller than 13.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:

    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list and also 1-hop neighbors of 14 forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: 
[<0, 4, 12>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 14>, <8, 11, 12>, <4, 9, 0>, <5, 14, 2>, <8, 11, 12>, <4, 9, 0>]
