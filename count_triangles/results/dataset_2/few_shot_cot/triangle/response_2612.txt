Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected as shown, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected as shown, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are directly connected as shown, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller.
    * No triangles were found with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are directly connected as shown, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles found with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles found with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles found with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles found with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles found with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are directly connected as shown, forming a triangle with Node 12.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles found with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles were found with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles were found with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles were found with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles were found with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18 and Node 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 18 or 19 to form triangles with them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 12) = 4

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
