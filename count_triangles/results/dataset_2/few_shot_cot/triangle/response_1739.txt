Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process like in the example above, we find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - <5, 9, 0> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - <3, 1, 9> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - <0, 2, 6> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

5. Node 4:
    - <3, 4, 5> forms a triangle.
    - <4, 7, 9> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. Node 5:
    - <0, 5, 3> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Node 6:
    - <2, 6, 1> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

9. Node 8:
    - <1, 8, 6> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Node 9:
    - <4, 7, 9> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
