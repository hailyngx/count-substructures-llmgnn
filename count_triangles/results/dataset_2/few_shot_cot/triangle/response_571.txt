Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3

Response:
Following the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph by analyzing each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the edge list (0, 3).
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the edge list (4, 7).
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the edge list (1, 9).
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected in the edge list (5, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list (0, 6).
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list (3, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4 - Node 9:
    * Continue with the same process for Nodes 4 to 9.

After going through each node, we find the following triangles:
[<0, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 7>]

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
