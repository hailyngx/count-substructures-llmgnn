Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Form a triangle with 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 14) -> Form a triangle with 0.
    * Pair 6: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 [<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 14>]

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Form a triangle with 1.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Form a triangle with 1.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Form a triangle with 1.
    * Pair 7: (6, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> Form a triangle with 1.
    * Pair 9: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3 [<1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 8>]

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 14>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 8>]
