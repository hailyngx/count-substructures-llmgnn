Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. Let's count the number of triangles in this graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> forms a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> forms a triangle <0, 2, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> forms a triangle <0, 7, 3>.
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) -> does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> forms a triangle <1, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> forms a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> forms a triangle <2, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> forms a triangle <1, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 4: (2, 0) -> forms a triangle <0, 2, 7>.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> forms a triangle <3, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> forms a triangle <0, 3, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> forms a triangle <6, 7, 8>.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 7, 8, 9:
    * Since there are no nodes with numbers greater than 9, no triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
