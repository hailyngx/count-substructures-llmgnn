Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (25, 26) -> 25 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 2) -> 15 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

4. Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 13:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 25) -> 13 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

15. Node 14:

28. Node 27:
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

29. Node 28:
    * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 0

30. Node 29:
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 13) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
