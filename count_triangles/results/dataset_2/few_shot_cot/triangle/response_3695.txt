Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (13, 2) in the edge list. Check for the third node connected to both 2 and 13.
      * (2, 0) and (0, 13) are not considered as the nodes are already included in the pair.
      * Therefore, a triangle is formed with nodes {0, 2, 13}.
        * Triangles found: <0, 2, 13>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (8, 11) in the edge list. Check for the third node connected to both 8 and 11.
      * (8, 1) is not considered as the node is already included in the pair.
      * Therefore, a triangle is formed with nodes {1, 8, 11}.
        * Triangles found: <1, 8, 11>

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 0) -> 11 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (0, 11) in the edge list. Check for the third node connected to both 11 and 0.
      * (11, 2) is not considered as the node is already included in the pair.
      * Therefore, a triangle is formed with nodes {0, 2, 11}.
        * Triangles found: <0, 2, 11>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (8, 5) in the edge list. Check for the third node connected to both 8 and 5.
      * (8, 3) is not considered as the node is already included in the pair.
      * Therefore, a triangle is formed with nodes {3, 5, 8}.
        * Triangles found: <3, 5, 8>

There are no additional triangles to form for Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 as all possibilities have been exhausted.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (4, 10) in the edge list. Check for the third node connected to both 4 and 10.
      * (4, 8) is not considered as the node is already included in the pair.
      * Therefore, a triangle is formed with nodes {4, 8, 10}.
        * Triangles found: <4, 8, 10>

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (13, 10) in the edge list. Check for the third node connected to both 13 and 10.
      * (13, 9) is not considered as the node is already included in the pair.
      * Therefore, a triangle is formed with nodes {9, 10, 13}.
        * Triangles found: <9, 10, 13>

There are no additional triangles to form for Nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14 as all possibilities have been exhausted.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
