Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 1) -> Both 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
