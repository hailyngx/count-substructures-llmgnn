Response:
Following the method used in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue the process for Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on until Node 14. Then count the total number of triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node and calculate the final answer.

The final answer would be the total count of triangles in the graph.  
Could you please find the total number of triangles present in the graph and output it within brackets?
