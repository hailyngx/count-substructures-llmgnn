Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0: No triangles can be formed as it only has one connection.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 3) -> 16 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 3) -> 17 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Follow the same steps for Nodes 3 to 18.

* Node 19:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 19, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = [5]
* Unique triangles: <2, 16, 17>, <3, 2, 17>, <4, 9, 15>, <7, 12, 18>, <9, 10, 15>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. The answer is [5].
