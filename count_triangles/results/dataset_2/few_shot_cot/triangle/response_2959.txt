Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected (7, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 10) -> 15 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (16, 13) -> 16 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2 as they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (19, 8) -> 19 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 as they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4 as they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7 as they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (17, 3) -> 17 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Since there wasn't a triangle with any of the considered nodes as the smallest numbered node, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 0.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
