Response:
Following the same approach as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 1 are connected as (6, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 0 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 0 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> This pair was already considered when processing Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> This pair was already considered when processing Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 6 are connected as (7, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 1 are connected as (9, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 3 are connected as (7, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 0 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 0 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 9 are connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as all potential neighbors are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as all potential neighbors are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as all potential neighbors are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are:
<4, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <9, 1, 5>, <7, 3, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <0, 2, 6>, <4, 0, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
