Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided:
      
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Direct connection between 7 and 9. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair (1, 3) since 1 is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (1, 26) -> Direct connection between 1 and 26. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 27) -> Direct connection between 1 and 27. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> No direct connection between 10 and 19. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 22) -> No direct connection between 10 and 22. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 29) -> No direct connection between 13 and 29. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (16, 25) -> No direct connection between 16 and 25. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for the remaining nodes.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 6) -> Direct connection between 12 and 6. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 15) -> Direct connection between 14 and 15. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 21) -> No direct connection between 15 and 21. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for the remaining nodes.

* Node 29:
    * Pair 1: (13, 21) -> No direct connection between 13 and 21. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (remaining nodes) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [5].
