    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11 to 30:
    * Skipping analysis as they have smaller numerical labels compared to the above nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (all others) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
