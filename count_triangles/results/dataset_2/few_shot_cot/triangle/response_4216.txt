Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - Nodes 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) - Nodes 1 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) - Nodes 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) - Nodes 7 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) - Nodes 7 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 16) - Nodes 12 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) - Nodes 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors and are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 18>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) - Nodes 12 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) - Nodes 12 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 15) - Nodes 13 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) - Nodes 10 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors and are connected. Triangle formed: <6, 10, 18>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 1: (9, 19) - Nodes 9 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) - Nodes 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors and are connected. Triangle formed: <8, 14, 17>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than Node 11.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
