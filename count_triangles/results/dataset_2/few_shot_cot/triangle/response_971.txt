Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and there is a direct edge between them. 
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and there is a direct edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and there is a direct edge between them.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and there is a direct edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and there is a direct edge between them.
    * Pair 2: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and there is a direct edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and there is a direct edge between them.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and there is a direct edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
