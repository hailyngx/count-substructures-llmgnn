Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (6, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (2, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (6, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Since there are no triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node, we can stop here and move on to the remaining nodes.

        Continue the process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 following the same steps.

        Calculating the total number of triangles by adding up the triangles from each node:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

        Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
