Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 5) -> 10 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Continuing this process for nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, the total number of triangles in the given graph is found to be 51.
