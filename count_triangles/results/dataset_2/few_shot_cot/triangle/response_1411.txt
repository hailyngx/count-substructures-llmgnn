Response:
Following the instructions, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 7 are also connected as (14, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 4 are connected as (11, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 11 and 5 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they do not share an edge in the adjacency list or the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (11, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (1 is smaller than 4).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (1, 2, 3, 4 are smaller than 5).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are smaller than 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0 is smaller than 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 are smaller than 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (2 and 8 are smaller than 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (16 is smaller than 10).
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (1, 2, 9 are smaller than 11).
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (3, 8, 5, 6, 7, 11 are smaller than 12).
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 13 to form a triangle.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 6, 7 are smaller than 14).
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (10, 5, 2, 3, 17, 12 and 6 are smaller than 15).
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (10, 4, 11 are smaller than 16).
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (12, 3, 15, 6 are smaller than 17).
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (8, 10 are smaller than 18).
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 19 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
