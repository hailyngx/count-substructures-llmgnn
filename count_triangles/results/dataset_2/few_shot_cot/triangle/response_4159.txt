Response:
Following the step-by-step process detailed in the previous example, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pair with smaller nodes than Node 1.
  * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair with smaller nodes than Node 2.
  * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  * No pairs for forming a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
  * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than Node 6.
  * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than Node 7.
  * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than Node 8.
  * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
  * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than Node 10.
  * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than Node 11.
  * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than Node 12.
  * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than Node 13.
  * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
  * No new triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph. The unique triangle found is <0, 5, 7>.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
