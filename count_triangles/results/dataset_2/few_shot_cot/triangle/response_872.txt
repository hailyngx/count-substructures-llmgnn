Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

Continuing with Nodes 10 to 19...

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Only one 1-hop neighbor for Node 16 (Node 12). Not enough nodes to form a triangle.

* Node 17:
    * Only one 1-hop neighbor for Node 17 (Node 18). Not enough nodes to form a triangle.

* Node 18:
    * Node 18 has no 1-hop neighbors. Not enough nodes to form a triangle.

* Node 19:
    * Only one 1-hop neighbor for Node 19 (Node 15). Not enough nodes to form a triangle.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the given graph:
Total triangles = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) 
Total triangles = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
