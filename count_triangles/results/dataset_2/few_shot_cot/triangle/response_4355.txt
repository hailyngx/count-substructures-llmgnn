Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 10 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 11 are also connected as (6, 11) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 12 are also connected as (6, 12) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 10 and 11 are also connected as (10, 11) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 5: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 10 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (10, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 11 and 12 are also connected as (11, 12) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 10 and 14 are directly connected as (10, 14) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 10 and 12 are not directly connected as there is no edge (10, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 12 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (12, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skipped pairs with smaller nodes than 2.
            * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 4 are also connected as (6, 4) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 10 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 10 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (10, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 11 are also connected as (8, 11) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (8, 8) -> Not considering self-loops.
            * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        Continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 following the same steps as above, and count the total number of triangles at the end.

        Therefore, the final answer should be the total number of triangles in brackets [] at the end of the process, considering all nodes as the potential smallest numbered node.
