Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 24) -> 1 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected (1, 24) not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 25) -> 1 and 25 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (24, 25) -> 24 and 25 are directly connected as (0, 24) and (0, 25). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 26) -> 8 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are connected as (0, 1) and (0, 25). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 26) -> 0 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 29) -> 8 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 21) -> 8 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 29) -> 21 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (10, 21), but since 10 and 21 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2. 
    * Pair 1: (22, 26) -> 22 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 3) -> 14 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 3) -> 18 and 3 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11, 12, 13:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (27, 10) -> 27 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (27, 16) -> 27 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 15, 16, 17:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 18:
    * The only pair we could consider is (20, 27), but since 20 and 27 are both smaller than 18, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 19, 20:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Nodes 21, 22, 23:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Nodes 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

The unique triangle found is: <0, 24, 25>.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
