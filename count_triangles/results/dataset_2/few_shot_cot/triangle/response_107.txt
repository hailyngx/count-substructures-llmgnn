Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected because (3, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected because (3, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
