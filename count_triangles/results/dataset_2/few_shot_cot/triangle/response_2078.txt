Response:
Following the step-by-step approach mentioned in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors, and 2 and 17 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Node 3 forms a triangle with the pair (3, 5) connected directly through edge (3, 5).
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors, and 5 and 10 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8:
    - Skip, as they do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

* Node 9:
    - Skip pair (3, 15) as they are smaller nodes.
    - Node 9 forms a triangle with the pair (9, 15) connected directly through edge (9, 15).
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors, and 10 and 19 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 11.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Nodes 12, 13:
    - Skip, as they do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

* Node 14:
    - Skip, as there is only one connected node.

* Node 15: 
    - Node 15 forms a triangle with the pair (15, 16) connected directly through edge (15, 16).
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    - Skip pair (15, 16) as they are smaller nodes.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 17:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 17.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 18.
    - Pair 1: (18, 13) -> 18 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 19.
    - Pair 1: (0, 19) -> 0 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors, and 0 and 19 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
