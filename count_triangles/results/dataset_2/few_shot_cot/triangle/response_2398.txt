Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
