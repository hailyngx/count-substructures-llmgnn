Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Nodes 6 and 7 are directly connected. 
        * Triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 6, 7>
        * Triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <6, 0, 7>
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are directly connected.
        * Triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 3, 5>
        * Triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 2, 5>
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Nodes 3 and 7 are directly connected.
        * Triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 3, 7>
        * Triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 2, 7>
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are directly connected.
        * Triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 5, 7>
        * Triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: <5, 2, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are directly connected.
        * Triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 4, 7>
        * Triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 3, 7>
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are directly connected.
        * Triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 5, 7>
        * Triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: <5, 3, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

The process will continue for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 to count the triangles. Let's proceed to calculate it.
