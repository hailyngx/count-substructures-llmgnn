Response:
Following the same procedure as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle found: <0, 1, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> Triangle found: <0, 1, 11>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> Triangle found: <0, 1, 14>.
    * Pair 4: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 14) -> Triangle found: <0, 3, 14>.
    * Pair 7: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (11, 14) -> Triangle found: <0, 11, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Triangle found: <1, 3, 6>.

    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> Triangle found: <1, 6, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Triangle found: <2, 7, 8>.

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed as node 4 only has one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Triangle found: <5, 7, 11>.

    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed as node 9 only has three neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed as node 10 only has two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed as node 14 only has four neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 1, 14>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 13>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 14>, <2, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 11>, <7, 9, 11>, <0, 11, 14>]
