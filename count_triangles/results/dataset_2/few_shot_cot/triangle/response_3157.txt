Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, no direct connection between 13 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 25) -> 15 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, no direct connection between 15 and 25. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (25, 8) -> 25 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, no direct connection between 25 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (25, 21) -> 25 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, no direct connection between 25 and 21. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (22, 16) -> 22 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, no direct connection between 9 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 21) -> 3 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, no direct connection between 3 and 21. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 9), but since 6 is smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 8) -> 13 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, no direct connection between 13 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, no direct connection between 9 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skipped as each of these nodes does not have at least two other nodes greater than itself to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
