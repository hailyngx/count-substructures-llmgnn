Response:
Following the same approach as the example given earlier, let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than them as well. No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 8, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 12. No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skip these nodes as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 10)
* Total number of triangles in the graph = [3]

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
