Response:
Following the step-by-step process as demonstrated in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 5: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 6: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5 and Node 7:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 larger nodes to form a triangle with.

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 larger nodes to form a triangle with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
