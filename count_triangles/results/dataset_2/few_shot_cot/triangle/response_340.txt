Response:
Let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it has only one neighbor.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Formed triangle <1, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Formed triangle <2, 8, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Formed triangle <2, 8, 10>.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Formed triangle <2, 10, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Formed triangle <3, 9, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Formed triangle <3, 9, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4 and 5:
    * Skipped because they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 9) -> 12 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Formed triangle <7, 12, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (12, 4) -> 12 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 6>, <2, 8, 13>, <2, 8, 10>, <2, 10, 14>, <3, 9, 7>, <7, 12, 9>. 

So, the final answer is [7].
