Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 0 because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 5, 11>
    * Pair 2: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8 because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip the pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
