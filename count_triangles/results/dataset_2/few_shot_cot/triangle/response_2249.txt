Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 6) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 4: (8, 1) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 5: (8, 7) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 6: (1, 7) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least two greater-numbered nodes to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
