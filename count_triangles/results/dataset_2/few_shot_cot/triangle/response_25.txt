Response:
Alright, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the step-by-step process for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 1 are also connected as (4, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
	* No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 3 are also connected as (9, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
