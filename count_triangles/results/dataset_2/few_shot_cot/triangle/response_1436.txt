Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are connected. Forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pair involving Node 0 as it's smaller. No other pairs remain to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected. Forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are connected. Forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are connected. Forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller. 
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are connected. Forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are connected. Forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * No other pairs remain to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Continue the process for Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

After counting triangles for all nodes, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16]. 

This is the final answer, and the unique triangles found inside <> are:
<0, 7, 12>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 15, 19>, <4, 10, 11>, <6, 7, 18>, <12, 16, 19>, <4, 9, 10>, <11, 12, 16>, <3, 7, 18>, <3, 15, 16>, <3, 4, 17>, <4, 15, 16>, <4, 17, 18>, <7, 18, 19>, <14, 16, 18>, <16, 17, 18>.
