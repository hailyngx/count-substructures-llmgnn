Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Connected through edge (2, 5). Node 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 1) -> Node 0 and Node 1 are connected through edge (0, 1). Not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 8) -> Connected through edge (0, 1). Node 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Connected through edge (4, 3). Node 4 and 3 are neighbors of Node 2 but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Connected through edge (0, 5). Node 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (6, 2) -> Connected through edge (6, 2). Node 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Connected through edge (3, 5). Node 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (0, 8) -> Connected through edge (0, 5). Node 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Connected through edge (9, 7). Node 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Connected through edge (2, 8). Node 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Connected through edge (4, 6). Node 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Connected through edge (0, 1). Node 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 8. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Connected through edge (6, 8). Node 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
