Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
