Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as described in the example above, here is the breakdown for the given graph to count the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it only has one neighbor.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 18 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 13 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 14 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as it only has two neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as it only has two neighbors.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it only has two neighbors.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it only has one neighbor.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and 14 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as it only has three neighbors.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, but 2 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, but 3 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as it only has four neighbors.

* Node 16:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as it only has two neighbors.

* Node 17:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as it only has three neighbors.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 18, and 2 and 19 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 19, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
