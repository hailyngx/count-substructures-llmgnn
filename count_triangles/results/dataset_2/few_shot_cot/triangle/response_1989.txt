Therefore, there are 21 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are:
<16, 18, 23>, <4, 17, 24>, <4, 24, 9>, <9, 12, 24>, <12, 19, 22>, <12, 19, 25>, <12, 28, 13>, <19, 22, 25>, <20, 25, 9>, <20, 25, 19>, <8, 25, 21>, <16, 18, 0>, <6, 17, 21>, <8, 16, 18>, <15, 2, 4>, <16, 18, 23>, <17, 4, 24>, <17, 6, 21>, <15, 2, 21>, <15, 27, 29>, <1, 14, 29>.
