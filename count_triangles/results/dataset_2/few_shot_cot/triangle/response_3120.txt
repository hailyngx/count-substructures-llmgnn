Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Connected via edge (9, 0), but 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Connected via edge (12, 0), but 5 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 1-hop neighbors and connected via edge (8, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) -> 1-hop neighbors and connected via edge (0, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node. Move to the next node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 1-hop neighbors and connected via edge (4, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 1-hop neighbors and connected via edge (5, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No new triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node. Move to the next node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 1-hop neighbors and connected via edge (11, 14). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 1-hop neighbors and connected via edge (5, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 1-hop neighbors and connected via edge (5, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 1-hop neighbors and connected via edge (0, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> 1-hop neighbors and connected via edge (0, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 1-hop neighbors and connected via edge (4, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node. Move to the next node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> 1-hop neighbors and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 1-hop neighbors and connected via edge (5, 14). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 1-hop neighbors and connected via edge (7, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * No triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node. Move to the next node.

* Node 14:
    * No new triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 13

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
