Response:
Following the process explained in the example, we will count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 1 are also connected as (3, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 4 are also connected as (5, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 5 are also connected as (6, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 3 are also connected as (6, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 5 are also connected as (6, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 0 are also connected as (7, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 4 are also connected as (5, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 4), but since 8 and 4 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip as no pair is possible due to the absence of at least two nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
