Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 13 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 12 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's continue this process for the remaining nodes.

After counting triangles for all nodes, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 8, 0>
<5, 2, 14>
<0, 8, 5>
