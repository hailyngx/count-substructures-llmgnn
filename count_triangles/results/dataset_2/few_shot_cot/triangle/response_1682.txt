Response:
Following the same method as the example provided and using the given graph information, let's count the triangles by analyzing each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>
        * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed: <1, 5, 9>
        * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <1, 5, 7>
        * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Triangle formed: <2, 6, 10>
        * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> Triangle formed: <1, 6, 2>
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed: <4, 9, 14>
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Triangle formed: <6, 8, 10>
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Triangle formed: <7, 11, 13>
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 8.
        * Pair 1: (10, 2) -> Triangle formed: <2, 8, 10>
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
        * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> Triangle formed: <4, 9, 11>
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
        * Skipping as each only has connections with nodes smaller than themselves.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph: <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 10>, <1, 6, 2>, <4, 9, 14>, <6, 8, 10>, <7, 11, 13>, <2, 8, 10>, <4, 9, 11>.
