Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
   - <5, 6, 0>: 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
   - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
   - No triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
   - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
   - No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
   - <0, 6, 3>: 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4:**
   - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
   - No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
   - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
   - No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
   - <5, 7, 6>: 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. **Node 7:**
   - <3, 11, 7>: 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. **Node 8:**
   - No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - <5, 9, 12>: 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. **Node 10:**
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. **Node 11:**
    - <1, 7, 11>: 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

13. **Node 12:**
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. **Node 13:**
    - No triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. **Node 14:**
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 3) + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 + 1 (Node 9) + 0 + 1 (Node 11) + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
