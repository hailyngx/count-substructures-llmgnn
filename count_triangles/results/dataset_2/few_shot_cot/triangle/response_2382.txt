Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    - Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    - Pair 2: (5, 10) -> Does not form a triangle as Node 5 and Node 10 are not directly connected.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    - Pair 2: (10, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    - Pair 3: (10, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 12) -> Does not form a triangle as Node 6 and Node 12 are not directly connected.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    - Pair 2: (8, 12) -> Does not form a triangle as Node 8 and Node 12 are not directly connected.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Does not form a triangle as Node 0 and Node 9 are not directly connected.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
