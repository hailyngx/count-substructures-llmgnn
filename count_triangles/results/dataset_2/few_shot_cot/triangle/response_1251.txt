Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> Both 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> Both 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> Both 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
