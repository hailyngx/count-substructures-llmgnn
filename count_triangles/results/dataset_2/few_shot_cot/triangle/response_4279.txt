Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> These nodes are both connected to node 0, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Both nodes are connected to node 1 and are also directly connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Both nodes are connected to node 2 and directly connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> Both nodes are connected to node 2, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> These nodes are connected to node 3 and are also directly connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Both nodes are connected to node 4 and directly connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Both nodes are connected to node 5, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Both nodes are connected to node 6 and are also directly connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> These nodes are connected to node 6, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both nodes are connected to node 7 and directly connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> These nodes are connected to node 7, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> Both nodes are connected to node 8 and directly connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Both nodes are connected to node 9, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> These nodes are both connected to node 10, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Both nodes are connected to node 11 and are also directly connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> These nodes are connected to node 11, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> These nodes are connected to node 12, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> These nodes are connected to node 13, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Both nodes are connected to node 14 and directly connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Following the individual node analysis, we can summarize the total number of triangles in the graph:

* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
\[8\]
