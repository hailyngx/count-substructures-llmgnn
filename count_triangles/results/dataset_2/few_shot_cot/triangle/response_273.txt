Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 5 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 4 (Node 8) + 5 (Node 9) = 29

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 7, 0>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 3, 0>, <4, 0, 6>, <5, 1, 9>, <1, 7, 2>, <7, 2, 8>, <9, 1, 7>, <9, 1, 5>, <9, 3, 4>, <9, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 0>, <8, 4, 0>, <8, 4, 2>, <8, 2, 7>, <9, 3, 0>, <9, 3, 4>, <9, 4, 0>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 0, 3>, <4, 0, 8>, <4, 0, 6>, <5, 4, 7>, <5, 4, 9>, <5, 4, 0>, <4, 6, 0>, <7, 0, 3>, <7, 0, 8>, <7, 0, 6>
