Response:
Following the same methodology used in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than Node 3.
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles: 
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.

Let's now list the unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 3>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
