Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) - 8 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) - 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 19) - 16 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) - 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 15) - 14 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 15) - 17 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 6) - 10 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 15) - 10 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 15) - 6 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) - 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (14, 9) - 14 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 3) - 14 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) - 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 17) - 6 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 17) - 13 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 16) - 13 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 16) - 17 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
