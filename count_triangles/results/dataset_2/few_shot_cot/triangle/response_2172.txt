Response:
Following the example shown, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (15, 18) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (15, 19) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (18, 19) -> They are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 13) -> They are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 18) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (13, 18) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> They are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 17) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 17) -> They are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - There are no triangles involving Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    - Pair 1: (7, 13) -> They are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 1) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 2) -> They are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 5:
    - There are no triangles involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - There are no triangles involving Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    - Pair 1: (2, 17) -> They are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (1, 13) -> They are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 18) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

- Node 9:
    - There are no triangles involving Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 10:
    - There are no triangles involving Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

- Nodes 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than they are to form triangles.

- Node 19:
    - Pair 1: (0, 18) -> They are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 8) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 15) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 19) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.  
The triangles found are:  
[<0, 18, 19>, <1, 13, 4>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 17>, <4, 7, 13>, <4, 7, 2>, <7, 2, 17>, <8, 1, 13>, <19, 0, 18>]
