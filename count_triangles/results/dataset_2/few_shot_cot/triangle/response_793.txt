Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 21) -> 3 and 21 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 21) -> 6 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (22, 3) -> 22 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 12) -> 22 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

[Calculating the total number of triangles]

Total triangles in the graph = Sum of triangles for each node

[Calculating the total number of unique triangles]

[7 (Node 2) + 11 (Node 7) + 5 (Node 8) + 7 (Node 12) + 6 (Node 15) + 2 (Node 17) + 4 (Node 18) + 4 (Node 19) + 8 (Node 22) + 8 (Node 24) + 8 (Node 25) + 6 (Node 29) + 2*13 (Remaining nodes)] / 3 = 34 unique triangles

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [Total triangles: 108, Total unique triangles: 34].
