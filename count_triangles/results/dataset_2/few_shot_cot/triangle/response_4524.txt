Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1, (18, 1), and (0, 1).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0, (0, 18), and (0, 1).
    * Pair 2: (12, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12, (12, 11), and (0, 11).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15, (8, 17), and (0, 17).
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3, (0, 3), and (0, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5, (5, 7), and (7, 19).
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2, (0, 14), and (0, 10).
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7, (7, 15), and (0, 15).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with the remaining nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15, (12, 17), and (0, 17).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15, (12, 17), and (0, 17).
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * No triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 18, (0, 18), and (0, 11).
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with the remaining nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with the remaining nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15, (12, 17), and (0, 17).
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with the remaining nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 17, 18>
<1, 0, 11>
<1, 12, 17>
<2, 3, 14>
<2, 8, 15>
<3, 5, 19>
<3, 7, 15>
<7, 15, 17>
<8, 15, 17>
<11, 18, 0>
<17, 15, 12>

The final answer is [11].
