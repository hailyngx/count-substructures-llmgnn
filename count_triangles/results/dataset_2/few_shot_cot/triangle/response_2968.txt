Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Connected as 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 2: (11, 29) - Connected as 11 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) - Not connected as there is no edge between 12 and 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (17, 27) - Connected as 17 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 2: (6, 27) - Connected as 6 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 25) - Connected as 6 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (24, 26) - Connected as 24 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) - Connected as 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5.
    * Pair 2: (13, 25) - Connected as 13 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 5.
    * Pair 3: (21, 11) - Not connected as there is no edge between 21 and 11.
    * Pair 4: (20, 21) - Not connected as there is no edge between 20 and 21.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (17, 27) - Connected as 17 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 6.
    * Pair 2: (2, 27) - Connected as 2 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (18, 26) - Connected as 18 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 7.
    * Pair 2: (7, 27) - Connected as 7 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 22) - Connected as 11 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) - Connected as 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) - Connected as 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes...
