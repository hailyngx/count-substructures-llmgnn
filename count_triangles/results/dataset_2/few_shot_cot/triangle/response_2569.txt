Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with 1-hop neighbors smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Not connected to any other nodes. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with 1-hop neighbors smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10 to Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 10 to 19 as the smallest numbered node because they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
