Response:
Following the step-by-step approach shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (Triangles <4, 5, 6> and <4, 6, 7>)

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 or 9 as they are greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 4)
* There are 2 triangles in the given graph: <4, 5, 6> and <4, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the final answer in square brackets is: [2].
