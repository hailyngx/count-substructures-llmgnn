Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 21) -> 1 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 22) -> 1 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Next nodes to consider: 19.
    * Pair 5: (19, 21) -> 19 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (19, 16) -> 19 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (19, 22) -> 19 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. The triangle is formed: <0, 1, 19>.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Next nodes to consider: 19.
    * Pair 2: (19, 0) -> 19 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. The triangle is formed: <1, 19, 0>.

* Node 2:
    * Since Node 2 has fewer than 2 greater-numbered neighbors, no triangle can be formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (24, 10) -> 24 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Next nodes to consider: 10.
    * Pair 2: (10, 5) -> 10 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Next nodes to consider: 5.
    * Pair 3: (5, 24) -> 5 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. The triangle is formed: <3, 10, 5>.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (25, 19) -> 25 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Next nodes to consider: 19.
    * Pair 2: (19, 10) -> 19 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Next nodes to consider: 10.
    * Pair 3: (10, 24) -> 10 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. The triangle is formed: <4, 19, 10>.

The triangles found:
[<0, 1, 19>, <1, 19, 0>, <3, 10, 5>, <4, 19, 10>]
