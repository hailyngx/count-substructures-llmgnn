Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3)

Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the previous example to count the triangles in the graph given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

The analysis for the remaining nodes will be carried out in a similar manner to finally compute the total number of triangles in the given graph. Let's proceed with this process.
