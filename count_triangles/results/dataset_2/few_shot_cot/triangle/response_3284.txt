    - Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are connected.
    - Pair 3: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected.
    - Pair 4: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are connected.
    - Pair 6: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected.
    - Pair 7: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (12, 8) -> 12 and 8 are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    - Similar to Node 0, no new triangles are formed.

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Similar to Node 0, no new triangles are formed.

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are connected.
    - Pair 2: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are connected.
    - Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are connected.
    - Pair 4: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are connected.
    - Pair 8: (14, 8) -> 14 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:

* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 1 triangle

Calculating the total number of triangles: 
2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 11) + 0 = 9

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
