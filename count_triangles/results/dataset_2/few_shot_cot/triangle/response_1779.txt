Response:
Following the step-by-step method illustrated in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 12 are also connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 14 are also connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 4 and 11 are also connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 11>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 12 are also connected. Triangle formed: <6, 7, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 4 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 through Node 14:
    Due to their node IDs being larger than 7, 8, and 6, they do not have at least two other nodes higher than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8-14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
[<2, 4, 12>, <2, 3, 14>, <4, 5, 11>, <6, 7, 12>]
