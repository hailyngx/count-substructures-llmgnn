This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0)

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph based on each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> No edge between them.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip the pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> No edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip the pairs with Nodes 2 and 8 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip the pairs with Nodes 4 and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip the pairs with Nodes 6 and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
