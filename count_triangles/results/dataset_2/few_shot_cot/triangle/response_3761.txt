Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <6, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
