Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the given adjacency list and edge list:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 24) -> 12 and 24 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 29) -> 12 and 29 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (24, 29) -> 24 and 29 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 23) -> 17 and 23 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 27) -> 4 and 27 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 23) -> 5 and 23 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 24) -> 2 and 24 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 22) -> 7 and 22 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 26) -> 7 and 26 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 29) -> 8 and 29 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as there is only 1 node connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9: 0

Continuing for the remaining nodes:

* Node 10: Total triangles = 0
* Node 11: Total triangles = 0
* Node 13: Total triangles = 0
* Node 14: Total triangles = 0
* Node 15: Total triangles = 0
* Node 16: Total triangles = 0
* Node 17: Total triangles = 0
* Node 18: Total triangles = 0
* Node 19: Total triangles = 0
* Node 20: Total triangles = 0
* Node 21: Total triangles = 0
* Node 22: Total triangles = 0
* Node 23: Total triangles = 0
* Node 24: Total triangles = 0
* Node 25: Total triangles = 0
* Node 26: Total triangles = 0
* Node 27: Total triangles = 0
* Node 28: Total triangles = 0
* Node 29: Total triangles = 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the given graph = 3 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 16

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
