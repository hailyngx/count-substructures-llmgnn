Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected through (2, 6) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected through (4, 7) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected through (4, 1) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected through (4, 6) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected through (6, 9) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected through (7, 9) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected through (3, 8) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected through (4, 8) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected through (8, 2) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and connected through (6, 7) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and connected through (6, 1) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and connected through (7, 1) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * There are no other nodes connected to Node 5. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, we continue the process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 to find the total number of triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and connected through (7, 9) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and connected through (9, 1) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 and connected through (0, 2) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 and connected through (1, 7) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
