Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 21) - Triangle formed with 0, 4, and 21.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 21) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (19, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 20) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 20) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 28) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (29, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (29, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (20, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (20, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (27, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (27, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (25, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (25, 22) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 22) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (27, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (27, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles starting with Node 10.

The process is continued for the remaining nodes:

* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 1 triangle
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 1 triangle
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 1 triangle
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 0 triangles
* Node 22: 0 triangles
* Node 23: 0 triangles
* Node 24: 0 triangles
* Node 25: 0 triangles
* Node 26: 0 triangles
* Node 27: 0 triangles
* Node 28: 0 triangles
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
