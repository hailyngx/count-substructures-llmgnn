Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (16, 21) -> 16 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 24) -> 6 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 22) -> 12 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Skipping Nodes 8 to 29 as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

So, the output in brackets [] is [3].
