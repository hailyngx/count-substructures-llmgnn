Response:
Following the step-by-step approach as shown in the example:

1. Node 0:
    - <11, 12, 13>
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - <2, 5, 6>
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - <5, 12, 14>
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - <5, 9, 14>
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Skip as all other nodes connected are smaller

6. Node 5:
    - Skip as all other nodes connected are smaller

7. Node 6:
    - <0, 1, 3>
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - Skip as all other nodes connected are smaller

9. Node 8:
    - Skip as all other nodes connected are smaller

10. Node 9:
    - <7, 11, 14>
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. Node 10:
    - Skip as all other nodes connected are smaller

12. Node 11:
    - <0, 7, 8>
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

13. Node 12:
    - Skip as all other nodes connected are smaller

14. Node 13:
    - Skip as all other nodes connected are smaller

15. Node 14:
    - Skip as all other nodes connected are smaller

Summing up the triangles from each node:
[1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 11) = 7]

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
