Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 2

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (as shown by the edges (1, 5) and (2, 5)).
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 (as shown by the edges (1, 2) and (8, 2)).
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 (as shown by the edges (1, 8) and (6, 8)).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 (as shown by the edges (3, 6) and (8, 6)).
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (as shown by the edges (3, 5) and (2, 5)).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 (as shown by the edges (5, 6) and (8, 6)).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
