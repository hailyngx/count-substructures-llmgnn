Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 through 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0
* Answer: [0]

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
