Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8)

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 1 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 4 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.

I used "<>" to denote a triangle where the vertices are inside the "<>".
