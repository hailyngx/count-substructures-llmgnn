Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> Both 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (9, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
