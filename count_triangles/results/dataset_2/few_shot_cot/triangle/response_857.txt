Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they share node 1 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they share node 1 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they share node 1 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they share node 0 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they share node 0 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they share node 0 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they share node 0 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they share node 0 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

5. Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (0, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (0, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they share node 1 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

7. Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are both directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    * The only pair to consider is (1, 3), but those nodes are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
