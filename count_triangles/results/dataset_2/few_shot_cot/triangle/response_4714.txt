Response:
Following the steps provided in the example and taking into consideration the adjacency list for each node, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected as there is no edge (4, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (5, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (9, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (0, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as (2, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected as there is no edge (6, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as (7, 0) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
