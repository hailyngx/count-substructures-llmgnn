Response:
Following the same process as the provided example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> No triangle formed as Node 12 is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> No triangle formed as Node 18 is smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 25) -> No triangle formed as Nodes 3 and 25 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 22) -> No triangle formed as Node 22 is not directly connected to Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.

    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 28) -> Triangle formed with Node 28.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed as Node 13 is smaller than 11.
    * Pair 2: (11, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 11.
    * Pair 3: (13, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2 

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0  

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (10, 27) -> No triangle formed as Nodes 10 and 27 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (10, 28) -> Triangle formed with Node 28.
    * Pair 3: (10, 18) -> No triangle formed as Nodes 10 and 18 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0
