Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be considered as all other nodes are smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be considered as all other nodes are smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
