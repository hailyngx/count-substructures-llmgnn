Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 5

Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the same steps as shown in the example, here are the triangles found for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
