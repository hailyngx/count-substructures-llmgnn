Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 14.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.
  
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
