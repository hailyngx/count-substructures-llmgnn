Response:
Following the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

1. **Node 0:**
   - <17, 16, 1> is not a triangle as 17 and 16 are not directly connected.
   - No other possible triangles for Node 0.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:**
   - <9, 1, 0> is not a triangle as 9 and 1 are not directly connected.
   - No other possible triangles for Node 1.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
   - <8, 2, 12> is a triangle as all three nodes are directly connected.
   - No other possible triangles for Node 2.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3:**
   - <4, 3, 10> is not a triangle as 4 and 10 are not directly connected.
   - <3, 19, 15> is not a triangle as 19 and 15 are not directly connected.
   - No other possible triangles for Node 3.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
   - <7, 4, 3> is not a triangle as 7 and 3 are not directly connected.
   - No other possible triangles for Node 4.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
   - <18, 5, 11> is not a triangle as 18 and 11 are not directly connected.
   - No other possible triangles for Node 5.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
   - No possible triangles for Node 6.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
   - No possible triangles for Node 7.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
   - No possible triangles for Node 8.
   - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - No possible triangles for Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. **Node 10:**
    - No possible triangles for Node 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. **Node 11:**
    - No possible triangles for Node 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. **Node 12:**
    - <13, 12, 2> is a triangle as all three nodes are directly connected.
    - No other possible triangles for Node 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

14. Nodes 13, 14, 15, and 16 have no triangles.
15. **Node 17:**
    - <9, 17, 12> is a triangle as all three nodes are directly connected.
    - No other possible triangles for Node 17.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

16. **Node 18:**
    - No possible triangles for Node 18.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

17. Node 19 has no triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
