Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same process as described in the example:

1. **Node 0**:
   - <13, 0, 7>
   - No other triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

2. **Node 1**:
   - <7, 1, 3>
   - No other triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. **Node 2**:
   - <1, 2, 12>
   - No other triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. **Node 3**:
   - No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. **Node 4**:
   - No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. **Node 5**:
   - <5, 13, 3>
   - No other triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6**:
   - No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. **Node 7**:
   - No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. **Node 8**:
   - No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. **Node 9**:
    - No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. **Node 10**:
    - No triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. **Node 11**:
    - No triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. **Node 12**:
    - No triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

14. **Node 13**:
    - <13, 17, 5>
    - No other triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. **Node 14**:
    - No triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

16. **Node 15**:
    - No triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

17. **Node 16**:
    - No triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

18. **Node 17**:
    - No triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

19. **Node 18**:
    - No triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

20. **Node 19**:
    - No triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Calculate the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles found for each node: 
[<13, 0, 7>, <7, 1, 3>, <1, 2, 12>, <5, 13, 3>, <13, 17, 5>] = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
