Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 8). Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (8, 10, 16). Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 9). Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (9, 8, 16). Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 9) -> 17 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (17, 1) -> 17 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (17, 9, 1). Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (9, 8, 16). Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (1, 9, 17). Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Pair 3: (16, 13) -> 16 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 7.

    * Pair 2: (10, 9) -> 10 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (17, 1) -> 17 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (17, 9, 1). Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
