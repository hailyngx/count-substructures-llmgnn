Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 1, 2) and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - Pair 1: (2, 17) -> Both 2 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 2) and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 3) and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (10, 5) -> Both 10 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4 and 5:
    - No triangles formed with Nodes 4 or 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - Pair 1: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    - No triangles formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - No triangles formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - No triangles formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - No triangles formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - No triangles formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 16, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - No triangles formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - No triangles formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes and pairs where there is no direct edge.
    - No triangles formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
