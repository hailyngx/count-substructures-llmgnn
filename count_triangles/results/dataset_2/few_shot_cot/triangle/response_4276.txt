Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 8) -> Connected, forms triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 7: (9, 2) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 2) -> Connected, forms triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 10: (4, 8) -> Connected, forms triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 11: (2, 8) -> Connected, forms triangle with Node 8.
    
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4
    Unique triangles involving Node 0: <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 2, 8>

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Connected, forms triangle with Node 7.
    
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique triangles involving Node 1: <1, 6, 7>

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Connected, forms triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Connected, forms triangle with Node 8.
    
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    Unique triangles involving Node 2: <2, 4, 3>, <2, 4, 8>

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Connected, forms triangle with Node 7.
    
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique triangles involving Node 3: <3, 6, 7>

5. Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> Connected, forms triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (8, 0) -> Connected, forms triangle with Node 0.
    
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    Unique triangles involving Node 4: <4, 2, 8>, <4, 8, 0>

6. Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Connected, forms triangle with Node 6.
    
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique triangles involving Node 5: <5, 6, 9>

7. Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
