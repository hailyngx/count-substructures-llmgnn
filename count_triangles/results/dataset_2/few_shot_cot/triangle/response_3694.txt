Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph.
