Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example given, let's count the triangles in the graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 2>
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 1>
    * Pair 4: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 3) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 3>
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 4) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 8>
    * Pair 5: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
