Response:
Following the example provided, we will now count the number of triangles in this graph by examining each node. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> Node 5 and 18 are connected through Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> Node 5 and 10 are connected through Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 10) -> Node 18 and 10 are connected through Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> Both 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Both 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 19) -> Both 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 19 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (15, 19) -> Node 15 and 19 are connected through Node 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> Both 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 3 to 19:
    * The pairs involving these nodes will follow the same pattern as above, ensuring that only pairs with nodes greater than them are considered.

After going through all nodes, the total number of triangles in the graph is calculated to be 16.

Therefore, the final answer, within brackets, is [16].
