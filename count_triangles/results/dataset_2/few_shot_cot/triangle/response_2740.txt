Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Both 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) -> Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Both 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> Both 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Both 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> Both 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> Both 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are considered in a similar manner.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [17]. The unique triangles found are <3, 1, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 6, 5>, <8, 4, 5>, <8, 6, 5>, <8, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 9, 2>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, and <5, 8, 6>.
