Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example using the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (8, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (2, 3) -> Node 2 and Node 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also directly connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The triangle involving Node 0 has already been counted.
    * No other triangles to form with nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip triangles with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip triangles with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No other triangles to form with nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip triangles with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No other triangles to form with nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The single triangle involving Node 1 has already been counted.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * The triangle involving Node 1 has already been counted.
    * No other triangles to form with nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip triangles with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No other triangles to form with nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
