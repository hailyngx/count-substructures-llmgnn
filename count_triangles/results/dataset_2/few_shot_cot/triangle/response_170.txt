Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 29) -> 9 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 26) -> 1 and 26 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (29, 5) -> 29 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (29, 28) -> 29 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 23) -> 13 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (15, 2) -> 15 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 16:
    * Skipped as other nodes are larger.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (22, 21) -> 22 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for Nodes 10 to 29. 

After counting triangles for all nodes, sum up the total triangles:

[Total number of triangles in the graph: 10]
[List of unique triangles: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 9, 29>, <0, 18, 21>, <2, 5, 15>, <2, 1, 29>, <3, 28, 29>, <4, 13, 23>, <5, 15, 2>, <9, 19, 23>, <9, 21, 22>]
