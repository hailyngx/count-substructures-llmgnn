Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Connected (1-hop neighbors)
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> Connected (1-hop neighbors)
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Connected (1-hop neighbors)
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Connected (1-hop neighbors)
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Connected (1-hop neighbors)
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> Not connected
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Connected (1-hop neighbors)
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (2, 7, 8)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> Not connected
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Not connected
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Connected (1-hop neighbors)
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> Connected (1-hop neighbors)
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> Connected (1-hop neighbors)
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (8, 9, 11), (8, 9, 14), (8, 11, 14)

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Connected (1-hop neighbors)
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Connected (1-hop neighbors)
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> Connected (1-hop neighbors)
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Connected (1-hop neighbors)
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> Connected (1-hop neighbors)
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (14, 3) -> Not connected
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
