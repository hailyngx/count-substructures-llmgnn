Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Skipped as there are no triangles involving Node 0.

2. **Node 1:**
    - Skipped as there are no triangles involving Node 1.

3. **Node 2:**
    - Skipped as there are no triangles involving Node 2.

4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (7, 11) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (19, 3) in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 because (15, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4:**
    - Skipped as there are no triangles involving Node 4.

6. **Node 5:**
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (16, 5) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

7. **Node 6:**
    - Skipped as there are no triangles involving Node 6.

8. **Node 7:**
    - Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Already counted when examining Node 3.
    - Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
    - Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (16, 8) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. **Node 9:**
    - Skipped as there are no triangles involving Node 9.

11. **Node 10:**
    - Skipped as there are no triangles involving Node 10.

12. **Node 11:**
    - Skipped as there are no triangles involving Node 11.

13. **Node 12:**
    - Skipped as there are no triangles involving Node 12.

14. **Node 13:**
    - Skipped as there are no triangles involving Node 13.

15. **Node 14:**
    - Skipped as there are no triangles involving Node 14.

16. **Node 15:**
    - Skipped as there are no triangles involving Node 15.

17. **Node 16:**
    - Pair 1: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 16, and they are connected as (16, 18) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

18. **Node 17:**
    - Skipped as there are no triangles involving Node 17.

19. **Node 18:**
    - Pair 1: (18, 16) -> Already counted when examining Node 16.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

20. **Node 19:**
    - Skipped as there are no triangles involving Node 19.

Calculating the total number of triangles: 
Total triangles = 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 16) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5 triangles] in the given graph.
