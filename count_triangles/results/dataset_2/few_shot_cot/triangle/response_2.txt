Response:
Following the same methodology as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 4, 7 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 7, 12 as they are smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No connections, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8, 10, 11, and 13 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 10, 12, and 13 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9, 11, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 as it is smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 5, 7, and 14 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 12 as it is smaller than 11.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 14 as it is smaller than 12.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 13.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No connections, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

So, the number of triangles in the graph is [2].
