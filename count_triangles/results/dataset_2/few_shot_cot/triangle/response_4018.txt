Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided: 

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 since they are smaller than 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 6:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. 
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.

            * Pair 5: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 5

        * Node 8:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. 
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.

        * Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15:
            * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

        * Node 16:
            * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 17:
            * Pair 1: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Nodes 18 and 19:
            * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 5 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Nodes 10-15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Nodes 18, 19) = 15.

        Therefore, there are [15] triangles in the given graph. 

        Here are the unique triangles found: 
        <0, 2, 7>
