Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will now find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Skip as they are not directly connected.
    * Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 14>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> Skip as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Skip as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> Skip as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (0, 2) -> Skip as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 5) -> Skip as they are not directly connected.
    * Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 2>

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Skip as they are not directly connected.
    * Triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: <7, 10, 14>

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Skip as they are not directly connected.
    * Triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: <8, 9, 11>

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> Skip as they are not directly connected.
    * No other pairs to consider with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No triangles formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * No triangles formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Skip as they are not directly connected.
    * Triangle formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 4, 12>

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to consider with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Skip as they are not directly connected.
    * Triangle formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 14>

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
