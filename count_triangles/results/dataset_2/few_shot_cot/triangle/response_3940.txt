Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 2
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 5
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 2
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 1
    * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 5
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 2
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 3
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 8
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 0
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 5
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can form triangles with Node 6
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can form triangles with Node 7
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 8
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 2
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 9
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
