Response:
Considering each node and its 1-hop neighbors to find the triangles:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 2 and 9.
            * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2, 7, and 0 form a triangle <0, 2, 7>.
            * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 2 and 3.
            * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 9 and 7.
            * Pair 5: (9, 3) -> 9, 3, and 0 form a triangle <0, 9, 3>.
            * Pair 6: (7, 3) -> 7, 3, and 0 form a triangle <0, 7, 3>.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4, 8, and 1 form a triangle <1, 4, 8>.
            * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 4 and 7.
            * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8, 7, and 1 form a triangle <1, 7, 8>.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 4 and 8.
            * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 4 and 3.
            * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 8 and 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 5 and 9.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 5 and 8.
            * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 9 and 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 5 and 6.
            * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 5 and 2.
            * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 5 and 1.
            * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 6 and 2.
            * Pair 5: (6, 1) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 6 and 1.
            * Pair 6: (2, 1) -> Not a triangle; no edge between 2 and 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * No pairs to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * No pairs to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * No pairs to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 5.

        Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

        The triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <0, 9, 3>, <0, 7, 3>, <1, 4, 8>, and <1, 7, 8>.

        The final answer is [5].
