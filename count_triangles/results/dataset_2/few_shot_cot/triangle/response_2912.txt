Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. They are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. They are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (15, 1) -> 15 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (17, 1) -> 17 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (17, 11) -> 17 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. They are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (17, 7) -> 17 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. They are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2. They are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2. They are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. They are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. They are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4. They are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing with the same process for the rest of the nodes:

* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 1 triangle
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 1 triangle
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
