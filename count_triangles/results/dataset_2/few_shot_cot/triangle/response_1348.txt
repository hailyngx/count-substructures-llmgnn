Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above to count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 10 are also connected  (6, 10) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 11 are also connected  (5, 11) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected  (5, 9) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 13 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 11 are also connected  (9, 11) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 8 are also connected  (5, 8) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 9) -> 13 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 13 and 9 are also connected  (13, 9) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Already counted as a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 0 and 12 are also connected  (0, 12) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Already counted as a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Already counted as a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> Already counted as a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
