Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same process as the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Nodes 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Nodes 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Nodes 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> Nodes 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> Nodes 3 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> Nodes 3 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 14) -> Nodes 11 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 0) -> Nodes 11 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (11, 8) -> Nodes 11 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (14, 0) -> Nodes 14 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (14, 8) -> Nodes 14 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (0, 8) -> Nodes 0 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> Nodes 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 12>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Continuing this process for all the remaining nodes, we find the triangles formed:

* Node 0: <0, 2, 6>
* Node 1: <0, 1, 8>
* Node 2: <2, 3, 12>
* Node 9: <5, 9, 13>
* Node 13: <5, 9, 13>
  
Counting the unique triangles, we get a total of [5].
