Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count triangles in the graph: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both connected to 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (16, 4) -> 16 and 4 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are both connected to 10. No triangle formed.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 17. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Node 18 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 19. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Sum of all nodes) 

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [0].
