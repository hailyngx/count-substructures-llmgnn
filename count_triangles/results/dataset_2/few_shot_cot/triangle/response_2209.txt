Response:
Let's count the triangles in the provided graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) - Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) - Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) - No triangle can be formed.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) - Forms a triangle with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) - No triangle can be formed.

* Node 14:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 10) = 4

Therefore, the final answer is: [4].
