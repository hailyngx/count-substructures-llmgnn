Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs involving nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs involving nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (17, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than the node.

The process is skipped for Nodes 11 to 18 due to the absence of possible triangles.

* Node 19:
    * No pairs can be formed since there are no nodes greater than Node 19.

Summarizing, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 0.
