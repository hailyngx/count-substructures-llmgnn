Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the sample, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 23) -> 16 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 28) -> 16 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 8) -> 16 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (23, 28) -> 23 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no direct edge connecting them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipped pair with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipped pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 20) -> 7 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 20) -> 16 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipped pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipped pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipped pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 20) -> 3 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 20) -> 16 and 20 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7 as there is no direct edge connecting them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skipped pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 29:
    * There are no triangles possible with nodes 10 to 29 as the smallest numbered node. 

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
