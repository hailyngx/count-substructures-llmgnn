Response:
Following the same process as described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> This pair was already considered.
    * Pair 5: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The only possible pair is (8, 6), but as both nodes are smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7 through 14:
    * No pairs that involve nodes greater than 6. All skipped.
    * Total triangles with each of these nodes as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Nodes 7-14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 14>, <3, 4, 12>, <2, 5, 13>, <3, 4, 10>,  <1, 3, 4>.
Output: [5]
