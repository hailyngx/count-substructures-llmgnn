Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

Starting from Node 0:
- Pair 1: (4, 16) -> Both 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 16) shown in the edge list.
- Pair 2: (4, 18) -> Both 4 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 18) shown in the edge list.
- Pair 3: (16, 18) -> Both 16 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Moving on to Node 1:
- Pair 1: (3, 25) -> Both 3 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 25) shown in the edge list.
- No more possible pairs for Node 1 as all other nodes are smaller.

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, we have:
- Node 2: 0 triangles
- Node 3: 0 triangles
- Node 4: 0 triangles
- Node 5: 1 triangle: (25, 7, 5)
- Node 6: 0 triangles
- Node 7: 0 triangles
- Node 8: 1 triangle: (9, 2, 8)
- Node 9: 3 triangles: (14, 5, 9), (10, 5, 9), (14, 10, 9)
- Node 10: 0 triangles
- Node 11: 2 triangles: (27, 2, 11), (11, 26, 10)
- Node 12: 0 triangles
- Node 13: 2 triangles: (17, 13, 7), (18, 13, 7)
- Node 14: 1 triangle: (26, 14, 9)
- Node 15: 2 triangles: (21, 15, 17), (15, 16, 18)
- Node 16: 0 triangles
- Node 17: 2 triangles: (2, 17, 3), (13, 17, 15)
- Node 18: 0 triangles
- Node 19: 1 triangle: (27, 19, 23)
- Node 20: 0 triangles
- Node 21: 1 triangle: (15, 21, 3)
- Node 22: 0 triangles
- Node 23: 0 triangles
- Node 24: 2 triangles: (24, 19, 27), (24, 19, 23)
- Node 25: 1 triangle: (20, 25, 5)
- Node 26: 0 triangles
- Node 27: 0 triangles
- Node 28: 0 triangles
- Node 29: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles found for each node:
[Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 11) + 2 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 2 (Node 15) + 2 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 21) + 2 (Node 24) + 1 (Node 25) = 18]

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.
