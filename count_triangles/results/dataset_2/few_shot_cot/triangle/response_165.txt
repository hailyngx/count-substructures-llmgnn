Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> (4, 9) is an edge in the graph; they are also 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No third node connected to both in 1-hop. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> (0, 9) is an edge in the graph; they are also 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Node 4 is the third node connected to both in 1-hop. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) -> (0, 4) is an edge in the graph; they are also 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No third node connected to both in 1-hop. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 1) -> (0, 1) is an edge in the graph; they are also 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Node 9 is the third node connected to both in 1-hop. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0) as both endpoints.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1) as one of the endpoints.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> (2, 5) is an edge in the graph; they are also 1-hop neighbors of Node 2. Node 4 is the third node connected to both in 1-hop. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2) as one of the endpoints.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> (3, 5) is an edge in the graph; they are also 1-hop neighbors of Node 3. No third node connected to both in 1-hop. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3) as one of the endpoints.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> (4, 5) is an edge in the graph; they are also 1-hop neighbors of Node 4. Node 3 is the third node connected to both in 1-hop. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) as one of the endpoints.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) as one of the endpoints.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) as one of the endpoints.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) as one of the endpoints.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) as one of the endpoints.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
