Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8)

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> Connected to 4 and 1, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Connected to 4 and 8, and they are also 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Connected to 4 and 2, and they are also 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 2) -> Connected to 8 and 2, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 1) -> Connected to 8 and 1, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Connected to 9 and 4, and they are also 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Connected to 5 and 7, and they are also 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Connected to 5 and 0, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Connected to 5 and 9, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Connected to 5 and 7, and they are also 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Connected to 5 and 8, and they are also 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Connected to 9 and 1, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). No unique triangles can be formed with the remaining nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 5 as they are smaller. No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Connected to 5 and 4, and they are also 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
