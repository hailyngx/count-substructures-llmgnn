Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0: 
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) - This pair forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node since 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 13 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) - This pair forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node since 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 14 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) - This pair forms a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node since 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 12 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - This pair forms a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node since 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 6 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
  
* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - This pair forms a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node since 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
