Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 22) -> 9 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 26) -> 13 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 28) -> 13 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs are available for Node 5. No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (16, 26) -> 16 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 17) -> 1 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 16) -> 0 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 do not have enough higher-numbered neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 21:
    * Pair 1: (12, 27) -> 12 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 21, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 21, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 22:
    * Pair 1: (1, 22) -> 1 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 22, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 22) -> 2 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 22, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (19, 22) -> 19 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 22, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph: 11
Triangles: <0, 6, 8>, <2, 9, 22>, <3, 7, 14>, <4, 13, 26>, <6, 16, 26>, <7, 9, 17>, <8, 16, 0>, <9, 17, 7>, <12, 21, 27>, <21, 22, 1>, <22, 19, 1>
