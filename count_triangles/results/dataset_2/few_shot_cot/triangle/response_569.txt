Response:
Following the step-by-step process given in the example, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph based on the adjacency list and edge information:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 13) - Forms a triangle with Node 0.

        * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
