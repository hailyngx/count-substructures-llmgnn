Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph: 

* Node 0: 
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 16) -> 17 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 9) -> 17 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 9) -> 16 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 0) -> 15 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (19, 15) -> 19 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (19, 7) -> 19 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 7) -> 15 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Already counted when considering Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Already counted when considering Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Already counted when considering Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Already counted when considering Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 19 do not have at least two nodes with higher numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
