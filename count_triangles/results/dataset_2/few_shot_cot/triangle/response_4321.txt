Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with 20 nodes and 60 edges provided, we will determine the number of triangles in the graph. Each triangle will be listed only once in the final answer inside brackets [].

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (12, 19) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (12, 4) -> 12 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (4, 12) in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (4, 19) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    - Unique triangles: <4, 12, 19>

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles: <6, 7, 1>

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (13, 16) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles: <13, 16, 2>

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (11, 15) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles: <11, 15, 3>

5. Nodes 4, 5, and 6 to follow the same process as Nodes 0, 1, and 2.

6. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as (8, 15) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles: <8, 15, 11>

8. Nodes 9 to 19 can be processed using the same method.

9. Summarizing the triangles:
    - Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Nodes 9 to 19) = 11.
    - Final answer: [11]
    - Unique triangles: <4, 12, 19>, <6, 7, 1>, <13, 16, 2>, <11, 15, 3>, <4, 12, 2>, <4, 15, 5>, <0, 12, 19>, <13, 16, 6>, <1, 7, 9>, <8, 15, 11>, <0, 17, 19>.
