Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 10 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, 18 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, and 4 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 18) -> 2 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, 18 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, and 2 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 18) -> 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, 18 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, and 5 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, 14 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, and 8 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, 12 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, and 10 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 16) -> 10 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, 16 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, and 10 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 17) -> 10 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, 17 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, and 10 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 16) -> 12 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, 16 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, and 12 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 17) -> 12 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, 17 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, and 12 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 17) -> 16 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, 17 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, and 16 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, and 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> 7 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, 19 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, and 7 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, 13 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, and 7 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 19) -> 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, 19 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, and 9 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 13) -> 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, 13 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, and 9 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (19, 13) -> 19 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, 13 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, and 19 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Since these nodes didn't form any triangles, we'll continue the process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 in subsequent messages. Let's proceed with Node 5.
