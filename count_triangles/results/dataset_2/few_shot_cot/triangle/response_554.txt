Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example before:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, they are connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, they are connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, they are connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, they are connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <2, 9, 3>.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Next, we will continue with the same process for Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Finally, we will count the total number of unique triangles found and provide the answer. Let's continue with the calculations.
