Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
