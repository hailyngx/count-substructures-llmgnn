Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the step-by-step process for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (13, 9) -> 13 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * These nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with each of these nodes as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles found are as follows:
[<6, 9, 13>, <7, 12, 14>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 10>, <3, 7, 9>]
