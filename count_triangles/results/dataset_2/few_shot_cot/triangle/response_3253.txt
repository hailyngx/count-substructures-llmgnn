Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the graph by examining each node's 1-hop neighbors and forming triangles step-by-step. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 6: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as there are fewer than 2 nodes greater than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 27) -> 5 and 27 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 10) -> 17 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 6: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (20, 6) -> 20 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (20, 0) -> 20 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 3: (20, 7) -> 20 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Given the size and complexity of the graph, it's clear that we should continue this process node by node until all nodes have been examined to find the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed with this methodology.
