Response:
Following the same process as described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 29) -> 16 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 27) -> 16 and 27 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (16, 27) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (16, 19) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (27, 19) -> 27 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (27, 19) is in the edge list. Triangle formed: <0, 19, 27>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs that involve nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs that involve nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs that involve nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 27:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 28:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 29:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are: [<0, 19, 27>, <4, 11, 18>].
