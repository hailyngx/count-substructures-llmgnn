Response:
Following the same process as in the previous example, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected through (2, 3, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are connected through (17, 7, 19). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are connected through (14, 7, 17). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 18) -> 0 and 18 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 11.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are connected through (6, 15, 16). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are connected through (8, 14, 17). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 15.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected through (2, 16, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * No other nodes to form a triangle with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No other nodes to form a triangle with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No other nodes to form a triangle with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [5].
