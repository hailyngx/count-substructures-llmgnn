Response:
Following the same process as the example shown above, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 18) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 18 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 19) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (17, 18) -> No triangle formed as 17 and 18 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (17, 19) -> No triangle formed as 17 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (17, 6) -> No triangle formed as 17 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (18, 19) -> No triangle formed as 18 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (18, 6) -> No triangle formed as 18 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (19, 6) -> No triangle formed as 19 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one neighbor node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with only two neighbor nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 15 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (15, 5) -> No triangle formed as 15 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 8, 9, 12, and 16:
    * Doesn't have enough connections to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Nodes 4, 8, 9, 12, and 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (15, 8) -> No triangle formed as 15 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (15, 10) -> No triangle formed as 15 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 19) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 18) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 18 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (19, 18) -> No triangle formed as 19 and 18 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (19, 13) -> No triangle formed as 19 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (18, 13) -> No triangle formed as 18 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

And so on for the remaining nodes. After following this process for all nodes, the final answer would be: 
[0]
