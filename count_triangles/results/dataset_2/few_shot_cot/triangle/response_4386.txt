Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, I will now calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the provided graph is [1].
