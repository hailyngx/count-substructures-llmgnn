Response:
Following the same process explained in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 16) -> 0 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and so on:
    * Follow the same process as shown above for each node.

After calculating the triangles for each node, sum up the total triangles for all nodes in the graph and provide the answer within brackets [].
