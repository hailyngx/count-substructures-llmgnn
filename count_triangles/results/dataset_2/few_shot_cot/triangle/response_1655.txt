Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph using the information provided.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 11 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
