Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected, but 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected, but 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are connected, and 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <2, 11, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip the pair with Node 2 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are connected, but 3 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are connected, but 4 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are connected, and 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 16>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are connected, and 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <5, 17, 18>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are connected, but 5 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, but 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are connected, and 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <6, 16, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip the pair with Node 6 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected, but 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected, but 8 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are connected, and 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <8, 14, 11>.
    * Pair 3: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are connected, and 8 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <8, 17, 18>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15:
    * No triangles formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 17, 18, and 19:
    * No triangles formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
