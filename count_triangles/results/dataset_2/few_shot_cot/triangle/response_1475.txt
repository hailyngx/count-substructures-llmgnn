Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) - 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) - 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) - 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) - 0 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 16.

* Node 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
