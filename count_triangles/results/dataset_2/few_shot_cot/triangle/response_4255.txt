Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example to count triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 12: <0, 4, 7>
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <0, 7, 12>

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 13.

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
