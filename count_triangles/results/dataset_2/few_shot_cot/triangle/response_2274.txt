Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are connected as (9, 3) in the edge list. Now, checking for a third node connected to both 3 and 9. (3, 0) - 3 and 0 are connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <0, 9, 3>.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 3) -> 13 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (13, 1) -> 13 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are connected as (7, 3) in the edge list. Now, checking for a third node connected to both 3 and 7. (3, 0) - 3 and 0 are connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <0, 7, 3>.
    * Pair 9: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as it does not share edges with any pair of nodes greater than itself.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are connected as (6, 2) in the edge list. Now, checking for a third node connected to both 4 and 6. (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <2, 6, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 3, 4, 5: No triangles possible as each does not share edges with at least two nodes greater than themselves.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are connected as (9, 8) in the edge list. Now, checking for a third node connected to both 8 and 9. (8, 6) - 8 and 6 are connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <6, 9, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> Already checked when processing Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected as (8, 13) in the edge list. Now, checking for a third node connected to both 13 and 8. (13, 12) - 13 and 12 are connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <6, 8, 13>.
    * Pair 6: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are connected as (8, 5) in the edge list. Now, checking for a third node connected to both 5 and 8. (5, 4) - 5 and 4 are connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <2, 8, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 7, 8, 9: No triangles possible as each does not share edges with at least two nodes greater than themselves.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are connected as (8, 10) in the edge list. Now, checking for a third node connected to both 14 and 8. (14, 7) - 14 and 7 are connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <7, 8, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 11, 12: No triangles possible as they do not share edges with at least two nodes greater than themselves.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are connected as (8, 13) and (13, 12) in the edge list. Now, checking for a third node connected to both 12 and 8. (12, 7) - 12 and 7 are connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <7, 8, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are connected as (7, 12) in the edge list. Now, checking for a third node connected to both 12 and 7. (12, 14) - 12 and 14 are connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <7, 12, 14>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are connected as (7, 10) in the edge list. Now, checking for a third node connected to both 10 and 7. (10, 8) - 10 and 8 are connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <7, 10, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
