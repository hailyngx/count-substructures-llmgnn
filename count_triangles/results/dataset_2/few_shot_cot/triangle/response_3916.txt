Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will now find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) - 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (11, 13). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) - 11 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 6) - 13 and 6 are directly connected as (13, 6), and they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) - 9 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) - 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (9, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) - 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (9, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) - 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 8) - 12 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 6) - 12 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (12, 13) - 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 6) - 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (8, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (8, 13) - 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 13) - 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (6, 13). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs that include nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) - 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (6, 10). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) - 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 3) - 10 and 3 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No more pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skipping smaller nodes, there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skipping all pairs with smaller nodes.

* Node 6:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
