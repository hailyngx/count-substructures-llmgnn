Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 3

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected directly as (2, 3). 
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected directly as (5, 7). 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected directly as (6, 7). 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected directly as (5, 9).
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected directly as (5, 6).
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are connected directly as (9, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are connected directly as (7, 1).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [6].
