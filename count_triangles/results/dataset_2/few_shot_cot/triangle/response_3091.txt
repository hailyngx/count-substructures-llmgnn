Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 9) and (9, 0) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> Both 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Already counted in Pair 1.
    * Pair 4: (0, 12) -> Both 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 12) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Already counted in Pair 1.
    * Pair 4: (6, 11) -> Both 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> Both 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 11) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> Both 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 5, 6, or 7 to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> Both 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (7, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> Both 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> Both 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> Both 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 2) -> Both 10 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (11, 2) -> Both 11 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are connected as (11, 2) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles from each node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, the answer is [4].
