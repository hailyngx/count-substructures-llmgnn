Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 14 are also connected as (0, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 8 are also connected as (0, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 13 are also connected as (1, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 19 are also connected as (1, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 15 and 17 are also connected as (15, 17) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 10 and 12 are also connected as (10, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 16 and 19 are also connected as (16, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 10 and 18 are also connected as (10, 18) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 17 are also connected as (8, 17) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3 and 11 are also connected as (3, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Given the above analysis for the mentioned nodes, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 14>, <0, 8, 10>, <1, 9, 13>, <1, 13, 19>, <2, 15, 17>, <4, 10, 12>, and <7, 16, 19>.
