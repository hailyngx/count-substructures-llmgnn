Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (5, 10) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 4: (9, 13) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 5: (9, 10) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 6: (10, 13) -> Node 13 is connected to both 0 and 10, forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (17, 6) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (17, 2) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (17, 16) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 4: (17, 12) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 5: (6, 2) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 6: (6, 16) -> Node 16 is connected to both 1 and 6, forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 17) -> Node 4 is connected to both 2 and 17, forming a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (17, 1) -> Not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (5, 10) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (14, 10) -> Not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (7, 19) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (7, 13) -> Node 7 is connected to both 4 and 13, forming a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (7, 17) -> Node 7 is connected to both 4 and 17, forming a triangle.
    - Pair 4: (2, 17) -> Node 4 is connected to both 2 and 17, forming a triangle.
    - Pair 5: (2, 1) -> Not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (15, 16) -> Not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (0, 13) -> Node 0 is connected to both 5 and 13, forming a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (0, 10) -> Node 0 is connected to both 5 and 10, forming a triangle.
    - Pair 4: (0, 9) -> Not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    - These nodes do not form triangles with at least 2 other nodes greater than themselves.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) = 8

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
