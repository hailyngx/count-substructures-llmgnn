Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12:
  * Can't form triangles as there are no pairs greater than them.
  * Total triangles with Node 10, 11, and 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 13, 14, 15:
  * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 13, 14, and 15 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

* Nodes 16, 17, 18:
  * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 16, 17, and 18 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

* Nodes 19, 20, 21:
  * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 19, 20, and 21 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

* Nodes 22, 23, 24:
  * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 22, 23, and 24 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

* Nodes 25, 26, 27:
  * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 25, 26, and 27 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

* Nodes 28, 29:
  * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 28 and 29 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [0].
