Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> Both 2 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 26) -> 12 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 5) -> 26 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 25) -> Both 2 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 16) -> Both 2 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 21) -> Both 2 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (20, 24) -> 20 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 27) -> 8 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continuing this process for the remaining nodes...

After calculating for all nodes, we find that the triangles are:
[<1, 12, 26>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 14, 26>, <2, 15, 21>, <4, 20, 24>, <5, 10, 14>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
