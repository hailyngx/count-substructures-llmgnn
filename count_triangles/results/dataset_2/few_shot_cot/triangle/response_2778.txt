Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph with the given information.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 25) -> Both 1 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 1 are also directly connected as (0, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 16) -> 0 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 27) -> Both 17 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 27) -> 1 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 27 are also directly connected as (1, 27) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 0 are also directly connected as (1, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 29) -> Both 3 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 29) -> 2 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 29 are also directly connected as (2, 29) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 19 are also directly connected as (2, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 23) -> Both 15 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 15 and 23 are also directly connected as (15, 23) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 2 are also directly connected as (3, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Let's continue this process for the remaining nodes.
