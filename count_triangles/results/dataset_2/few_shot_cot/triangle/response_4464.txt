Response:
Following the same step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> Both 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 4: (4, 12) -> Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 6: (12, 8) -> Both 12 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> Both 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * No other triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> Both 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> Both 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (10, 15) -> Both 10 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * No other triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 6:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
        * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.
