Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (19, 11) -> 19 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangles with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangles with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
