Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (28, 29) -> 28 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (28, 19) -> 28 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 28 and 19 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (29, 19) -> 29 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 29 and 19 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 3) -> 17 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 17 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (17, 9) -> 17 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 17 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 17 and 19 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no other nodes to form a triangle with.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 25) -> 1 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 25 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (25, 8) -> 25 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (25, 20) -> 25 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 25 and 20 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (25, 29) -> 25 and 29 have no direct connection. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 29) -> 20 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 20 and 29 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.

    * Pair 2: (11, 24) -> 11 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 24) -> 16 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (16, 11) -> 16 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 12) -> 16 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 23) -> 12 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 26) -> 3 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 3 and 26 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 15) -> 26 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (17, 1) -> 17 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 17 and 1 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (17, 20) -> 17 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 22) -> 17 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

(The process continues for nodes 10 to 29; however, with the available data, no additional triangles can be formed with remaining nodes.)

Summarizing the triangles found:
[<0, 19, 28>, <0, 19, 29>, <1, 9, 17>, <1, 17, 19>, <1, 17, 3>, <3, 8, 25>, <4, 20, 25>, <4, 20, 29>, <8, 26, 3>, <9, 17, 1>] 

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
