Response:
Following the same approach as outlined in the example, here is the count of triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Nodes 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected (listed in the edges). Triangle formed: <0, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Nodes 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected (listed in the edges). Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) - Nodes 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected (listed in the edges). Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) - Nodes 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected (listed in the edges). Triangle formed: <1, 8, 0>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Nodes 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected (listed in the edges). Triangle formed: <2, 5, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) - Nodes 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected (listed in the edges). Triangle formed: <2, 13, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - Nodes 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected (listed in the edges). Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - Nodes 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected (listed in the edges). Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - Nodes 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected (listed in the edges). Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - Nodes 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected (listed in the edges). Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) - Nodes 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected (listed in the edges). Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (10, 4) - Nodes 10 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected (listed in the edges). Triangle formed: <4, 10, 5>.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) - Nodes 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected (listed in the edges). Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) - Nodes 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, however, they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 10:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 11:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 12:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 13:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 14:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
        
The answer is [13].
