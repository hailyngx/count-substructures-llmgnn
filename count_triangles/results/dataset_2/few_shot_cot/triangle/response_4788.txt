Response:
Following the method in the example, we will count the triangles for each node in the graph.

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Skipped other pairs with nodes smaller than 0.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Skipped other pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (4, 12) - Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Skipped other pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 0 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Skipped other pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Skipped other pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * Skipped other pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> Both 1 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Skipped other pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 to 19:
  * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
