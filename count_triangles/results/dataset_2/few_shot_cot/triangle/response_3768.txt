Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Now, we need to find a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of both 1 and 11.
        * Possible triangles: <0, 1, 11>
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as there is no edge (6, 3). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 2 to 14 based on the adjacency list provided.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Direct edge, triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 2-hop path: (2, 5), (5, 6), (2, 6). Triangle formed: <2, 5, 6>
    * ...
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: X

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1-hop path found. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 13>
    * ...
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: X

Continue this process for Nodes 4 to 14.

Finally, sum up all the triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node to get the total number of triangles in the graph. Output the final answer inside brackets, e.g., [X].
