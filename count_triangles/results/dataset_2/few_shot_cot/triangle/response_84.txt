Response:
Following the same method used in the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 20) -> 11 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 24) -> 11 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 26) -> 11 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected to each other directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 20) -> 14 and 20 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because there is no edge (14, 20) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
