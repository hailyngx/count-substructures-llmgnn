Response:
Following the example from the previous solution, let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (1, 12) shown in the edge list.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 2 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
So, the final answer is [10].
