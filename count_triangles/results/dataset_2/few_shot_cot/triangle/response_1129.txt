Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip as there is no pair involving a larger node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there is no pair involving a larger node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip as there is no pair involving a larger node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (17, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (16, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip as there is no pair involving a larger node.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip the single pair with Node 15.

* Node 17:
    * Skip as there is no pair involving a larger node.

* Node 18:
    * Skip the pairs involving Nodes 15 and 19.

* Node 19:
    * Skip as there is no pair involving a larger node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) =  0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
