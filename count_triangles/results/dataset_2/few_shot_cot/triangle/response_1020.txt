Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Repeat this process for the rest of the nodes until all nodes are covered.

Continuing the process for Nodes 2 to 14, we get the following triangle counts:

* Node 2: 1
* Node 3: 0
* Node 4: 0
* Node 5: 1
* Node 6: 1
* Node 7: 1
* Node 8: 1
* Node 9: 2
* Node 10: 0
* Node 11: 1
* Node 12: 3
* Node 13: 2
* Node 14: 0

Finally, summing up all the triangle counts:
* Total number of triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 3 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 14

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
