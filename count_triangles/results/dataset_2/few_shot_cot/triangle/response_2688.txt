Response:
Following the same process as in the previous example to count triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> Connected as 0 → 14 → 16 → 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 24) -> Connected as 0 → 14 → 24 → 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 24) -> Connected as 0 → 16 → 24 → 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (16, 11) -> Connected as 0 → 16 → 11 → 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (24, 11) -> Connected as 0 → 24 → 11 → 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Connected as 1 → 6 → 10 → 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (21, 25) -> Connected as 2 → 21 → 25 → 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Now continuing the process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 3:  
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:  
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:  
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:  
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:  
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:  
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:  
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:  
  * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Pair 1: (18, 27) -> Connected as 11 → 18 → 27 → 11. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:  
  * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:  
  * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:  
  * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:  
  * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:  
  * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:  
  * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:  
  * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:  
  * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 20:  
  * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 21:  
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 21.
    * Pair 1: (28, 4) -> Connected as 21 → 28 → 4 → 21. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 22:  
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 22.
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 23:  
  * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 24:  
  * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 25:  
  * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 26:  
  * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 27:  
  * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 28:  
  * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 29:  
  * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3-29) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
