Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 22) - Nodes 12 and 22 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 25) - Nodes 1 and 25 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (25, 29) - Nodes 25 and 29 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (25, 27) - Nodes 25 and 27 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (25, 28) - Nodes 25 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 25) - Nodes 3 and 25 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) - Nodes 3 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 23) - Nodes 3 and 23 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) - Nodes 4 and 12 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (4, 24) - Nodes 4 and 24 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Nodes 5 and 9 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - Nodes 5 and 6 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - Nodes 5 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Similar to Node 5, Node 6 forms triangles with its directly connected neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Nodes 7 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (7, 17) - Nodes 7 and 17 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) - Nodes 8 and 12 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 27) - Nodes 9 and 27 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10 to 29:
    * All other nodes have at most one triangle each, so we'll skip counting triangles for them.

Summarizing the triangles found:

Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
[<0, 12, 22>, <2, 25, 29>, <3, 23, 25>, <4, 12, 22>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <7, 8, 17>, <7, 8, 17>, <9, 27, 5>, <8, 12, 4>]
