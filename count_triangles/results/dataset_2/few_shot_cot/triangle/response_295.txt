Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's identify the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) -> 0 and 17 are connected and 0 and 17 are also connected (17, 0). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 20) -> 0 and 20 are connected and 0 and 20 are also connected (20, 0). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 26) -> 0 and 26 are connected, but 0 and 26 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are connected, but 1 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are connected and 1 and 16 are also connected (16, 1). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 3 to 29:
    * Skipping these nodes as they have smaller numbered connected nodes.

Summarizing the count of triangles for each node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 + ... + 0 (Nodes 2 to 29) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the final answer is [3].
