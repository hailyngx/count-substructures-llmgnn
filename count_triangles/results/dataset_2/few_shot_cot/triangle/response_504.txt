Response:
Following the process outlined in the initial example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <0, 1, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 1, 15>
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> Already counted with Node 0
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 4, 15>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
