Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0. Triangle: <0, 2, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0 and Node 1).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3. Triangle: <3, 5, 9>
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3. Triangle: <3, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, Node 1, and Node 2).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, and Node 4).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 5).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
