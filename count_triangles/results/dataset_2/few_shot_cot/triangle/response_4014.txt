Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Connected through edge (1, 5).
    * Pair 2: (1, 29) -> Connected through edge (1, 29).
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> Connected through edge (1, 0).
    * Pair 4: (5, 29) -> Connected through edge (5, 29).
    * Pair 5: (5, 0) -> Connected through edge (5, 1) and (1, 0).
    * Pair 6: (5, 18) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (29, 0) -> Connected through edge (29, 1) and (1, 0).
    * Pair 8: (29, 18) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (0, 18) -> Connected through edge (0, 17) and (17, 11) and (11, 18).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 29) -> Connected through edge (5, 29).
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Connected through edge (5, 1) and (1, 0).
    * Pair 3: (5, 18) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (29, 18) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 25) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 19) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (25, 19) -> Connected through edge (25, 2) and (2, 19).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> Connected through edge (6, 5) and (5, 14).
    * Pair 2: (14, 18) -> Connected through edge (14, 25) and (25, 2) and (2, 19) and (19, 27) and (27, 18).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * Skipped because they are smaller than Node 9.
  
* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (23, 12) -> Connected through edge (23, 20) and (20, 4) and (4, 10) and (10, 21) and (21, 29) and (29, 24) and (24, 18) and (18, 3) and (3, 6) and (6, 5) and (5, 1) and (1, 0) and (0, 11) and (11, 22) and (22, 14) and (14, 25) and (25, 2) and (2, 13) and (13, 21) and (21, 29) and (29, 1) and (1, 5) and (5, 20) and (20, 23).
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The rest of the nodes don't have at least two higher-numbered neighbors to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 29>, <0, 5, 29>, <0, 1, 0>, <0, 5, 18>, <0, 29, 0>, <0, 29, 18>, <0, 0, 18>, <1, 5, 29>, <1, 5, 0>. 
So, the final answer is [10].
