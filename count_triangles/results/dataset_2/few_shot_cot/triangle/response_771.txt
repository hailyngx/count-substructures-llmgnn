Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0).
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1).
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2).
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
