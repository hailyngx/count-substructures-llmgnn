Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 27) - Connected, and forms a triangle with Node 23.
    * Pair 2: (11, 29) - Connected, but does not form a triangle with Node 23.
    * Pair 3: (27, 29) - Connected, but does not form a triangle with Node 23.
    * Pair 4: (27, 23) - Connected, and forms a triangle with Node 11.
    * Pair 5: (29, 23) - Connected, but does not form a triangle with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) - Connected, but does not form a triangle with any other nodes.
    * Pair 2: (15, 18) - Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (19, 18) - Connected, but does not form a triangle with any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping Node 0 and Node 1.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (10, 13) - Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) - Connected, and forms a triangle with Node 22.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) - Connected, and forms a triangle with Node 12.
    * Pair 3: (8, 25) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 12) - Connected, but does not form a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 5: (9, 20) - Not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (19, 22) - Connected, but does not form a triangle with Node 8 or Node 12.
    * Pair 7: (19, 26) - Connected, but does not form a triangle with any other nodes.
    * Pair 8: (19, 1) - Connected, but does not form a triangle with any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5, 6, 7 are all skipped as they have no pairs that form triangles with other nodes.

Continuing this analysis for the remaining nodes, we find the following:
- Node 8: 0 triangles
- Node 9: 1 triangle
- Node 10: 0 triangles
- Node 11: 1 triangle
- Node 12: 0 triangles
- Node 13: 0 triangles
- Node 14: 1 triangle
- Node 15: 0 triangles
- Node 16: 0 triangles
- Node 17: 0 triangles
- Node 18: 0 triangles
- Node 19: 0 triangles
- Node 20: 0 triangles
- Node 21: 0 triangles
- Node 22: 1 triangle
- Node 23: 0 triangles
- Node 24: 0 triangles
- Node 25: 0 triangles
- Node 26: 0 triangles
- Node 27: 0 triangles
- Node 28: 0 triangles
- Node 29: 0 triangles

Adding up the total number of triangles found for each node:
[2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 1 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29)] = [7].

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
