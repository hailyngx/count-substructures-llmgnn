Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 12 are also connected as (5, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 0) -> 12 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 12 and 0 are not directly connected as there is no edge (12, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
