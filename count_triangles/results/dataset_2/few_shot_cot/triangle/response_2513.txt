Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> <0, 1, 9>
    * Pair 2: (0, 17) -> <0, 17, 18>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Skip, 0 is smaller than 1
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> <1, 13, 15>
    * Pair 3: (1, 23) -> <1, 23, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pairs are skipped as all other nodes connected to Node 2 are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs are skipped as all other nodes connected to Node 3 are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs are skipped as all other nodes connected to Node 4 are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pairs are skipped as all other nodes connected to Node 5 are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pairs are skipped as all other nodes connected to Node 6 are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Skip, 1 is smaller than 7
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> <7, 19, 28>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pairs are skipped as all other nodes connected to Node 8 are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pairs are skipped as all other nodes connected to Node 9 are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pairs are skipped as all other nodes connected to Node 10 are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Skip, 1 is smaller than 11
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> <11, 19, 28>
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, and then summing the total triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 11) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is: [6].
