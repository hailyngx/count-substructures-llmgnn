Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node:
        * <2, 10, 12>

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node:
        * <4, 13, 16>

* Node 5:
    * Triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node:
        * <5, 13, 17>

* Node 6:
    * Triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node:
        * <6, 9, 13>

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node:
        * <9, 13, 14>

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No additional triangles can be found with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node apart from the ones already counted.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No additional triangles can be found with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node apart from the ones already counted.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
