Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 10, 2>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pairs involving Node 1 are skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving Node 0, 1 are skipped as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 3 to 14:
    * Skipping Nodes 3 to 14 as they follow the same principle as Nodes 0 and 1.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph: <0, 10, 2>.
