Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0)

Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the method described in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 2:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 3:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 4:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 5:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 8:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 9:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
