Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (21, 17) -> 21 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 15) -> 16 and 15 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (14, 5) -> 14 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (24, 9) -> 24 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (15, 27) -> 15 and 27 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (16, 3) -> 16 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 12 to 17:
    * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than nodes 12 to 17.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (26, 29) -> 26 and 29 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 19 to 28:
    * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than nodes 19 to 28.

* Node 29:
    * No triangle can be formed starting from Node 29.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 18) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
