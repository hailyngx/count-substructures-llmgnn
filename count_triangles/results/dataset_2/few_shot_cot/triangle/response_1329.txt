Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

Starting with each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are connected. Let's check their 1-hop neighbors:
        * 1-hop neighbor set of Node 0: {6, 14, 3}
        * 1-hop neighbor set of Node 6: {5, 3, 4, 0}
        * 1-hop neighbor set of Node 14: {9, 11, 8, 5, 0, 1}
        * There are no common 1-hop neighbors of 6 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipping any pair with smaller nodes than 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are connected. Let's check their 1-hop neighbors:
        * 1-hop neighbor set of Node 9: {4, 14, 3, 1}
        * 1-hop neighbor set of Node 11: {10, 14, 1, 12, 2}
        * Common 1-hop neighbor of 9 and 11: 1
        * Triangle formed: <1, 9, 11>
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 14) -> Already considered in Pair 2. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping any pair with smaller nodes than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. Let's check their 1-hop neighbors:
        * 1-hop neighbor set of Node 7: {12, 2, 5, 1, 8}
        * 1-hop neighbor set of Node 8: {7, 2, 14}
        * Common 1-hop neighbor of 7 and 8: 2
        * Triangle formed: <2, 7, 8>
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are connected. Let's check their 1-hop neighbors:
        * 1-hop neighbor set of Node 7: {12, 2, 5, 1, 8}
        * 1-hop neighbor set of Node 12: {10, 11, 7, 4}
        * Common 1-hop neighbor of 7 and 12: 12
        * Triangle formed: <7, 12, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Continuing the process for Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 6...
