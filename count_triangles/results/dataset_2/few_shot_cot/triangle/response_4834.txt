Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> Both 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 3) -> Both 14 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * The only possible pair is (7, 9), but since 7 and 9 are both smaller than 1, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> Both 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (7, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (7, 14). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> Both 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Both 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (7, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (7, 13). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> Both 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 11) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 11) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * All possible pairs are skipped as they involve nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8 to 14) = 6

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
