Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 11 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair with node 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 4) -> 13 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 8) -> 13 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
