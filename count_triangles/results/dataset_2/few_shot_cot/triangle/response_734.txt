Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 8 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip as there are no other nodes greater than 3 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4. 
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are all smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are all smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are all smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are all smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are all smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
