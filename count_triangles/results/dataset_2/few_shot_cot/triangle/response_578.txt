Response:
Following the same approach as the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

Node 0:
- Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
- Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
- Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. No third node is common. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 1:
- Pair 1: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 2:
- Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 or 3, as they are smaller than 2.
- Pair 1: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are connected. No third node is common. No triangle formed.
- Pair 2: (10, 7) -> 10 and 7 are connected. No third node is common. No triangle formed.
- Pair 3: (10, 5) -> 10 and 5 are connected. No third node is common. No triangle formed.
- Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
- Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

The unique triangle found:
