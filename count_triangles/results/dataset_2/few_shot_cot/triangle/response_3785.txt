Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided for the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 13 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 15) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> Both 0 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (0, 19) -> Both 0 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 19 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (13, 19) -> Both 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 13 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8: Not enough higher-numbered nodes to form triangles with them.

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 10:
        * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 10 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Nodes 12, 13, and 14: No triangles formed as there are not enough higher-numbered nodes to form triangles with them.

    * Node 15:
        * Pair 1: (15, 13) -> 15 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, and 15 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, and 15 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Nodes 16, 17, and 18: No triangles formed as there are not enough higher-numbered nodes to form triangles with them.

    * Node 19:
        * Pair 1: (19, 10) -> 19 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 19, and 19 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 2 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 16.

Therefore, there are [16] triangles in the given graph.
