Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (11, 10) -> 11 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    - Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    - No triangle can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
