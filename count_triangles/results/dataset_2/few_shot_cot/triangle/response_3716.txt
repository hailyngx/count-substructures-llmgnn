Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Node 1 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) - Node 1 and Node 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - Node 4 and Node 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Node 3 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) - Node 8 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as the remaining pairs include smaller nodes.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - Node 9 and Node 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) - Node 9 and Node 11 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) - Node 9 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 11) - Node 14 and Node 11 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No additional triangles can be formed.

* Nodes 6 to 10:
    * No additional triangles can be formed involving these nodes.

* Nodes 11 to 14:
    * No additional triangles can be formed involving these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
