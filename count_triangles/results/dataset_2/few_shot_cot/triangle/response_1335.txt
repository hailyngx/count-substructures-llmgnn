Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (9, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 6, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 2. Triangle: <0, 4, 5>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 2. Triangle: <1, 4, 5>

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 0) -> Does not form a triangle as there is no third node connected to both 1 and 0.
    No other pairs to consider.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 1. Triangle: <1, 4, 5>
    No other pairs to consider.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    No other pairs to consider.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    No other pairs to consider.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    No other pairs to consider.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with node 8. Triangle: <3, 6, 8>
    No other pairs to consider.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with node 7. Triangle: <3, 6, 7>
    No other pairs to consider.

* Node 9:
    No pairs to consider as there is only one connection.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
