Response:
Following the approach described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.

    * Pair 2: (11, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 9) -> No triangle formed.

    * Pair 4: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
