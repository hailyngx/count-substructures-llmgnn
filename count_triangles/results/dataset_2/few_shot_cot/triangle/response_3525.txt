Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) - 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected through the edge (5, 2).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs of nodes with higher numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
