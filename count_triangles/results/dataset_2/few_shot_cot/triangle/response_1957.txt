Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected. Checking if there is a third node that connects them:
        * (5, 7, 15) is a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are connected. Checking if there is a third node that connects them:
        * (5, 15, 7) is a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are connected. Checking if there is a third node that connects them:
        * (0, 7, 15) is a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9 skipped for now as there are nodes with lower numbers to form triangles.

We will continue this process for the remaining nodes until all possibilities are exhausted.
