Response:
Following the example provided, here's the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph considering each node:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (7, 21) -> Form a triangle with Node 29 since 7 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0.
    - Pair 2: (21, 29) -> Form a triangle with Node 1 since 21 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0.
    - Pair 3: (0, 29) -> Node 0, 29, and 15 form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3
- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (29, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 24) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
- Node 3:
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0
- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 0 since 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4.
    - Pair 3: (4, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
- Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
- Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (7, 0) -> Form a triangle with Node 17 since 0 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7.
    - Pair 2: (7, 17) -> Form a triangle with Node 4 since 7 and 17 are connected to 4.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 0 since 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3
- Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Form a triangle with Node 22 as 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1
- Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (10, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0
- Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (11, 18) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 as 11 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1
- Nodes 12 - 29:
  - Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than their value to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
