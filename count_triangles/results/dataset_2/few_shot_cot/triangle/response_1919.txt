Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (24, 25) -> 24 and 25 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (26, 17) -> 26 and 17 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (15, 25) -> 15 and 25 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 4) -> 14 and 4 are connected directly. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected directly. Triangle formed: <4, 9, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more nodes to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (17, 6) -> 17 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 17 and 6 are also connected directly. Triangle formed: <6, 17, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (15, 7) -> 15 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 15 and 7 are also connected directly. Triangle formed: <7, 15, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (12, 7) -> 12 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 12 and 7 are also connected directly. Triangle formed: <7, 12, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (19, 7) -> 19 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 19 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangle can be formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (12, 9) -> 12 and 9 are connected directly. Triangle formed: <9, 12, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (14, 9) -> 14 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 14 and 9 are also connected directly. Triangle formed: <9, 14, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 10-29:
    * Skipping further analysis for these nodes as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
