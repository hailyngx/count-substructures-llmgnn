    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pairs: (7, 14), (7, 8), (14, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pairs: (9, 11), (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pairs: (11, 12), (11, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
