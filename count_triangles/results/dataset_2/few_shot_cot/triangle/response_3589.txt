Response:
Following the instructions given in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 15) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 15) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (17, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9, 10, and 11:
    * No triangles can be formed as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17:
    * No triangles can be formed as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Nodes 18 and 19:
    * No triangles can be formed as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 12) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
