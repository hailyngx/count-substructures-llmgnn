Response:
Following the same process as the example given, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * No pairs for a triangle, as there are no 3-hop neighbors remaining.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 3) in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (1, 3) in the edge list.
            * Pair 6: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * No pairs for a triangle, as there are no 3-hop neighbors remaining.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
            * No pairs for a triangle, as there are only 1 or no 1-hop neighbors remaining for each of these nodes.

        Summarizing the triangles: 
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

        Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
