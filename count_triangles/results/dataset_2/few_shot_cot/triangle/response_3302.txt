Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
   - Pair 1: (16, 8) -> For 0, both 16 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
   - Pair 2: (0, 6) -> For 0, both 16 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle found.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1**:
   - Pair 1: (11, 7) -> For 1, both 11 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle found.
   - Pair 2: (1, 12) -> For 1, both 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2**:
   - Pair 1: (9, 14) -> For 2, both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
   
   *Skipping the rest as smaller-numbered nodes are involved in all possible pairs.*

4. **Node 3**:
   - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 3.

5. **Node 4**:
   - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 4.

6. **Node 5**:
   - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 5.

7. **Node 6**:
   - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 6.

8. **Node 7**:
   - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 7.

9. **Node 8**:
   - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 8.

10. **Node 9**:
    - Pair 1: (1, 12) -> For 9, both 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.

11. **Node 10**:
    - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 10.

12. **Node 11**:
    - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 11.

13. **Node 12**:
    - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 12.

14. **Node 13**:
    - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 13.

15. **Node 14**:
    - Pair 1: (9, 18) -> For 14, both 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle found.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

16. **Node 15**:
    - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 15.

17. **Node 16**:
    - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 16.

18. **Node 17**:
    - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 17.

19. **Node 18**:
    - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 18.

20. **Node 19**:
    - No valid pairs for triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 19.

Adding up the triangles found for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
