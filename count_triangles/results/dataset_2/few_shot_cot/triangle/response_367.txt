Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (9, 10) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 10 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 1 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Now, continue the process for Nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6 following the same steps.

Here are the total number of triangles for each node:
* Node 0: 3
* Node 1: 0
* Node 2: 1
* Node 3: 2
* Node 4: 0
* Node 5: 0
* Node 6: 2
* Node 7: 1
* Node 8: 3
* Node 9: 1
* Node 10: 0
* Node 11: 0
* Node 12: 0
* Node 13: 1
* Node 14: 3

Finally, summing up the total number of triangles for all nodes:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 3 (Node 14) = 17.

Therefore, there are [17] triangles in the given graph.
