Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> Both 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> Both 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> Both 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> Both 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> Both 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Only pairs involving nodes larger than 2 are considered.
            * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Both 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> Both 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4: 
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
            * Similar to Node 5, no other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6-14) = 7.

        Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
