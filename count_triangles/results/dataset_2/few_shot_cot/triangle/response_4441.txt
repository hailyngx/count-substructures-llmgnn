Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 28) -> 10 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 19) -> 28 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 23) -> 11 and 23 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 14 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (21, 12) -> 21 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 21 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (19, 24) -> 19 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 19 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (19, 22) -> 19 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 19 and 22 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (19, 6) -> 19 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (24, 22) -> 24 and 22 are not connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 2: (5, 20) -> 5 and 20 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (29, 20) -> 29 and 20 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skipped because they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
