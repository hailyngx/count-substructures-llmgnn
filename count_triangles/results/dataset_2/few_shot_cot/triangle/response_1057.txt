Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 7) -> 15 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are connected directly. 
    * Pair 3: (15, 1) -> 15 and 1 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 19) -> 0 and 19 are connected directly. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 24) -> 12 and 24 are connected directly. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are connected directly. 
    * Pair 2: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are connected directly. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 21) -> 3 and 21 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 5) -> 21 and 5 are connected directly. 
    * Pair 3: (21, 16) -> 21 and 16 are connected directly. 
    * Pair 4: (21, 19) -> 21 and 19 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (20, 18) -> 20 and 18 are connected directly. 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 22) -> 2 and 22 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 19) -> 0 and 19 are connected directly. 
    * Pair 2: (19, 17) -> 19 and 17 are connected directly. 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (28, 17) -> 28 and 17 are connected directly. 
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, and 13:
    * Skipped because they are smaller than the previous nodes that have already been considered.

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes will eventually lead to the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed with the calculations.
