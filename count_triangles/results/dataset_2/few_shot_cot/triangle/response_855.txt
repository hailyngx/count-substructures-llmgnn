Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> Both 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> Both 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 8) -> Both 11 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (11, 12) -> Both 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 11 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 12) -> Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as all 1-hop neighbors of 4 are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Next, we will continue the process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to find the total number of triangles in the graph.
