Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> Both 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> Both 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> Both 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 10) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
