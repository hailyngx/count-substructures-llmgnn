Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph: 

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (0, 15) -> Both 15 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 24) -> Both 15 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 24) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 2 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, and 1 and 2 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, and 1 and 4 are directly connected as (1, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, but 2 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as (2, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Continue this process for each node in the graph, checking all possible pairs within the 1-hop neighbor set of each node to see if they are directly connected. 

After calculating triangles for all nodes, count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found.
