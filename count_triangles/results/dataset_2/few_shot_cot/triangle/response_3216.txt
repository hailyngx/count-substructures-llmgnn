Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 27) -> 8 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 21) -> 8 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 8) and (0, 21). 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
