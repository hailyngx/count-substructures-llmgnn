Response:
Following the instructions in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) - 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) - 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 11) - 0 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 6) - 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 2) - 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) - 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) - 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) - 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) - 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 12) - 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 1) - 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) - 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) - 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) - 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
  ...
  continue this process for the remaining nodes 4 to 14

By following the process of counting triangles for each node, we can find the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's calculate it.
