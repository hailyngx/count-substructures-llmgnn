Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, here is the breakdown of counting triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (15, 28) -> 15 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (15, 3) -> 15 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (15, 3). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (28, 3) -> 28 and 3 are not connected because (28, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Only one pair available. No other nodes to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Same as Node 0, Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are lesser than Node 2 and are skipped.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

Repeat the process for the remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles in the graph.
