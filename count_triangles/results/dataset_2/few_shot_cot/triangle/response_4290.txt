Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, here is the breakdown for finding the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (29, 17) -> 29 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (29, 13) -> 29 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (29, 26) -> 29 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (10, 5) -> 10 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (22, 8) -> 22 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (22, 14) -> 22 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (23, 5) -> 23 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (23, 9) -> 23 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Pair 1: (10, 24) -> 10 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 23) -> 4 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (16, 20) -> 16 and 20 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (18, 21) -> 18 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (18, 27) -> 18 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (21, 27) -> 21 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (17, 13) -> 17 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (17, 29) -> 17 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20:
        * No triangles can be formed as there are not at least two nodes greater than these nodes.

    * Nodes 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
        * Skipped as there are no triangles that can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
