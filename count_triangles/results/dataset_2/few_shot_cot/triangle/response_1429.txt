Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Now, we need to find a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of 0 and is also a 1-hop neighbor of 3 and 10. Checking the adjacency list, no such node exists. No triangle formed with Node 0 as the starting node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Now, we need to find a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of 1 and is also a 1-hop neighbor of 5 and 8. Looking at the adjacency list, Node 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1 and is also connected to Nodes 5 and 8 forming a triangle <1, 5, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Now, we need to find a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of 1 and is also a 1-hop neighbor of 8 and 12. Checking the adjacency list, no such node exists. One triangle formed with Node 1 as the starting node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Now, we need to find a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of 2 and is also a 1-hop neighbor of 5 and 7. Looking at the adjacency list, Node 14 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2 and is also connected to Nodes 5 and 7 forming a triangle <2, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed with Node 2 as the starting node.

Continuing this process for Nodes 3 to 14:

* Node 3: Total Triangles = 0
* Node 4: Total Triangles = 1
* Node 5: Total Triangles = 1
* Node 6: Total Triangles = 0
* Node 7: Total Triangles = 0
* Node 8: Total Triangles = 0
* Node 9: Total Triangles = 0
* Node 10: Total Triangles = 0
* Node 11: Total Triangles = 0
* Node 12: Total Triangles = 0
* Node 13: Total Triangles = 0
* Node 14: Total Triangles = 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
