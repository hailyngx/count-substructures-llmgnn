Response:
Following the same methodology as the provided example to count triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> Connected in the edge list. 
    * Pair 5: (9, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (13, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (13, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 10) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 11) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (10, 11) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (10, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (10, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (11, 14) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 14: (11, 13) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 15: (14, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 12) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 11) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (7, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (12, 11) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (1, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped since for each of them, there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
