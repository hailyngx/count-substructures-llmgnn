Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8.
