Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Nodes 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> Nodes 3 and 7 are connected in the edge list, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are connected in the edge list, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> Nodes 4 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 5) -> Nodes 8 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> Nodes 8 and 0 are connected in the edge list, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> Nodes 8 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> Nodes 8 and 7 are connected in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 4: (0, 3) -> Nodes 0 and 3 are connected in the edge list, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 5: (0, 4) -> Nodes 0 and 4 are connected in the edge list, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 6: (0, 5) -> Nodes 0 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (0, 7) -> Nodes 0 and 7 are connected in the edge list, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Nodes 3 and 4 are connected in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are connected in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Nodes 3 and 7 are connected in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Nodes 4 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No pairs remaining to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No pairs remaining to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * No pairs remaining to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are connected in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * No pairs remaining to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
