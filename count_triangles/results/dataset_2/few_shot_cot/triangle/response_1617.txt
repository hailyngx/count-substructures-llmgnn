Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (18, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 24) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 1) -> Node 1 is not a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (25, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (25, 24) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (25, 1) -> Node 1 is not a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (26, 24) -> Node 24 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0, and 26 and 24 are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (18, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 21) -> 18 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 and are connected. 
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 21) -> 21 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 2, but 6 and 21 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (3, 21) -> 21 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 2, and 3 and 21 are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> Both 7 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 and are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (7, 24) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 24) -> Node 24 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 3, and 18 and 24 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No other nodes left to form a triangle.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Following the same process, we continue to find the number of triangles for Nodes 6 to 29.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Nodes 11-29)
* Total triangles in the graph: 3

Therefore, the number of triangles in the provided graph is [3].
