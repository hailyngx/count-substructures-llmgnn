Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 23) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 27) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 23) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 27) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

The remaining nodes follow a similar pattern where no additional triangles can be formed. Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [0].
