Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 10 are connected as (4, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 14 are connected as (4, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 10 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 10 and 14 are connected as (10, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 12) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 14 are also connected as (5, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (8, 12) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 13 are connected as (8, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (8, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, and then count the total number of triangles. 

Finally, output the final answer inside brackets [].
