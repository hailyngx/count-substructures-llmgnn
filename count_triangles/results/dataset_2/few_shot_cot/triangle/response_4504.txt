Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as illustrated in the example above, we will now count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 27) -> 1 and 27 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 27) -> 4 and 27 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (4, 27) -> 4 and 27 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 25) -> 4 and 25 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (14, 25) -> 14 and 25 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 5: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (25, 15) -> 25 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        
        * Node 3:
            * No possible triangle can be formed with Node 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, and 3.
            * Pair 1: (21, 16) -> 21 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 4.
            * Pair 1: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        Continue this process for Nodes 6 through 29. 

        * Node 6:
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7 to Node 29:
            * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs involving at least 2 nodes greater than them.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Nodes 7 to 29) = 2.

        Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
