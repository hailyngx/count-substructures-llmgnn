Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 22) -> 15 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 12) -> 15 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 29) -> 15 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 28) -> 5 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 25) -> 5 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 21) -> 5 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 4) -> 21 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (20, 19) -> 20 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (20, 14) -> 20 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (19, 25) -> 19 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than these.

- Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (17, 26) -> 17 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, we find the triangles formed. After counting all triangles, the final answer is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<20, 19, 4>
<5, 25, 1>
<5, 21, 2>
<15, 12, 0>
