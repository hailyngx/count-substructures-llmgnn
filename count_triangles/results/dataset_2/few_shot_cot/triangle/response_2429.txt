Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 11) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs related to smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs related to smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs related to smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs related to smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs related to smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs related to smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
