Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
