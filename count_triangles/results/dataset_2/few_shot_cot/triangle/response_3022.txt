Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 13) -> 15 and 13 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 14) -> 17 and 14 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (16, 8) -> 16 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (19, 10) -> 19 and 10 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 5 to 19:

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the answer is [5].
