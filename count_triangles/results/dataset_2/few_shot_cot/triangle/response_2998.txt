Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, we will now find the number of triangles in the given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
        Therefore, triangle <0, 6, 14> is formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
        Therefore, triangle <0, 11, 14> is formed.

    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 all have no triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
