Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, here are the triangles found in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they do not form at least 2 triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
