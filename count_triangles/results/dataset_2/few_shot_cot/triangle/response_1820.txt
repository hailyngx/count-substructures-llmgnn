Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 25) - 3 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 25 are connected. Now, we search for the third node to form a triangle:
        - Looking at the adjacency list of 3 and 25, we find that they are connected to node 0. Here, we form a triangle <0, 3, 25>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) - 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 4 are connected. Now, we search for the third node to form a triangle:
        - Looking at the adjacency list of 4, we find that it is connected to nodes 0 and 8. Since there is no direct edge between 0 and 8 according to the edge list, no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) - 12 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Now, we search for the third node to form a triangle:
        - Looking at the adjacency list of 16, we find that it is connected to node 1. Since 16 is already one of the nodes in our pair, we have a triangle <1, 12, 16>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 23) - Both 1 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Now, we search for the third node to form a triangle:
        - Looking at the adjacency list of 23, we find that it is connected to nodes 1, 29, 19, and 15. Since 19 and 15 are common neighbors between 1 and 23, we can form triangles <1, 19, 23> and <1, 15, 23>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 11) - 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Now, we search for the third node to form a triangle:
        - Looking at the adjacency list of 11, we find that it is connected to nodes 2 and 7. Since 2 and 7 are already connected, we have a triangle <2, 11, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 15) - 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

We continue this process for all remaining nodes and count the total number of unique triangles at the end.

Calculating the total number of triangles and listing them out:
[<0, 3, 25>, <1, 12, 16>, <1, 19, 23>, <1, 15, 23>, <2, 11, 7>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
