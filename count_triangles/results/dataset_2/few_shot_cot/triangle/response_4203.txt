Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).
    * No triangle can be formed by Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
    * No triangle can be formed by Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
    * No triangle can be formed by Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (4, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3).
    * No triangle can be formed by Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed by Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
