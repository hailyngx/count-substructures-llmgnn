Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (15, 19). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (6, 17). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (6, 15). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (17, 15) -> 17 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 10: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (12, 2). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (15, 14) -> 15 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Let's continue this process for Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on, and then sum up the total triangles to find the final answer.
