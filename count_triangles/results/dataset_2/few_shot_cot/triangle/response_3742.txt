Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip as it only has one connection.

* Node 1:
    * Skip as it only has two connections.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 28) -> 0 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 28) -> 7 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (10, 22) -> 10 and 22 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 24) -> 10 and 24 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 24) -> 11 and 24 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 20:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 21:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 22:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 23:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 24:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 25:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 26:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 27:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 28:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

* Node 29:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough connections.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
