Response:
The adjacency list and edge list provided for the graph have 15 nodes and 60 edges. Let's go through each node and count the triangles they form in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, and 8.
