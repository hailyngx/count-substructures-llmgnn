Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 2 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 0 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles.

Summing up the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
