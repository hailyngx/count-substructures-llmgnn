Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's 2-hop neighborhood:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * <1, 3, 0> is a triangle as 1, 3, and 0 are all connected to each other.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No additional triangles can be formed involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * <4, 5, 0> is a triangle as 4, 5, and 0 are all connected to each other.
    * <4, 3, 7> is a triangle as 4, 3, and 7 are all connected to each other.

* Node 5:
    * <5, 9, 0> is a triangle as 5, 9, and 0 are all connected to each other.
    * <5, 1, 3> is a triangle as 5, 1, and 3 are all connected to each other.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No additional triangles can be formed involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No additional triangles can be formed involving Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No additional triangles can be formed involving Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No additional triangles can be formed involving Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) = 5

Therefore, there are total of 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are: [<1, 3, 0>, <4, 5, 0>, <4, 3, 7>, <5, 9, 0>, <5, 1, 3>]

So, the final answer is [5].
