Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * No other pairs are possible with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are directly connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 1.
  * No other pairs are possible with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected, but 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. 
  * No other pairs are possible with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are directly connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 3.
  * No other pairs are possible with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are directly connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 4.
  * No other pairs are possible with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * No possible pairs with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected.
  * No other pairs are possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
  * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected.
  * No other pairs are possible with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
  * Pair 1: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected.
  * No other pairs are possible with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
