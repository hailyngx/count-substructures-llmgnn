    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8 have less than 2 nodes greater than them for triangle formation, so we skip them.

    * Pair 4: (3, 11) - Directly connected (3, 11) edge
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 12, 13, and 14 have less than 2 nodes greater than them for triangle formation, so we skip them.

The total number of triangles in the graph is the sum of triangles found for each node:
[3 (Node 0) + 7 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 4 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) = 26]

Therefore, there are 26 triangles in the given graph.
