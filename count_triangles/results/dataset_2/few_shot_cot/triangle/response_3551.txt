Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) - Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) - Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) - Connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - Connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) - Connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) - Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) - Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) - Connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) - Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) - Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 10.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
