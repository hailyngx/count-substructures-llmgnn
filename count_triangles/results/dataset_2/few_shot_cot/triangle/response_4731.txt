Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, we can count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Form a triangle as they are both 1-hop neighbors and also connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> Form a triangle as they are both 1-hop neighbors and also connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Form a triangle as they are both 1-hop neighbors and also connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 3) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Form a triangle as they are both 1-hop neighbors and also connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 3) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Form a triangle as they are both 1-hop neighbors and also connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> Form a triangle as they are both 1-hop neighbors and also connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 1) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 0) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Pair 6: (1, 0) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Form a triangle as they are both 1-hop neighbors and also connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Form a triangle as they are both 1-hop neighbors and also connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Form a triangle as they are both 1-hop neighbors and also connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Do not form a triangle although they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing the process for Nodes 6 to 9:
* Node 6: <5, 7, 8>
* Node 7: No new triangles can be formed.
* Node 8: No new triangles can be formed.
* Node 9: No new triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 10.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
