Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed. [0, 2, 18]

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed. [6, 7, 16]

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed. [14, 16, 17]

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles found:
[0, 2, 18], [6, 7, 16], [14, 16, 17]

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
The final answer is [3].
