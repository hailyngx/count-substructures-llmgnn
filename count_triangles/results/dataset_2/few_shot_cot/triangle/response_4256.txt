Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) - Connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) - Connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 2) - Connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 13) - Connected but not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 13) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes 0 or 1.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) - Connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) - Connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 11) - Connected but not 1-hop neighbors of Node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 13) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 13) - Connected but not 1-hop neighbors of Node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * All these nodes have at least one triangle formation with other nodes as highlighted in the pairs above.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 5

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
