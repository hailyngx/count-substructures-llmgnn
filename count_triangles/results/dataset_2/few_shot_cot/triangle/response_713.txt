Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the provided information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected. Considering Node 1 for the last node of the triangle.
        * Triangle found: <0, 1, 7>
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected. Considering Node 3 for the last node of the triangle.
        * Triangle found: <0, 3, 6>
    * Pair 6: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are connected. Considering Node 7 for the last node of the triangle.
        * Triangle found: <0, 7, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected. Considering Node 4 for the last node of the triangle.
        * Triangle found: <1, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected. Considering Node 4 for the last node of the triangle.
        * Triangle found: <2, 4, 8>
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected. Considering Node 4 for the last node of the triangle.
        * Triangle found: <2, 4, 6>
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are connected. Considering Node 8 for the last node of the triangle.
        * Triangle found: <2, 8, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are connected. Considering Node 0 for the last node of the triangle.
        * Triangle found: <3, 0, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected. Considering Node 5 for the last node of the triangle.
        * Triangle found: <4, 5, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6 and 7:
    * Skipped since these nodes have fewer than 2 nodes greater than them.

* Summarizing the triangles found:
    * Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 9.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
