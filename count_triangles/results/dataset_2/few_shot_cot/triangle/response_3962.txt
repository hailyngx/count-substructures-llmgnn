Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7), (2, 11) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7), (2, 11) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2), (7, 17) -> 2, 7, and 17 form a triangle. <2, 7, 17>
    * Pair 4: (7, 2), (7, 16) -> 2, 7, and 16 form a triangle. <2, 7, 16>
    * Pair 5: (7, 2), (7, 9) -> 2, 7, and 9 form a triangle. <2, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 17), (7, 16) -> 2, 7, and 17 form a triangle. This triangle was already counted. No new triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8), (4, 15) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8), (4, 3) -> 3, 4, and 8 form a triangle. <3, 4, 8>
    * Pair 3: (8, 11), (8, 7) -> 3, 8, and 11 form a triangle. <3, 8, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* For the rest of the nodes, the process will be similar. Let's calculate the total number of triangles now.

Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 4 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 2 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 2 (Node 19) = 27

[27] 

Therefore, there are 27 triangles in the given graph.
