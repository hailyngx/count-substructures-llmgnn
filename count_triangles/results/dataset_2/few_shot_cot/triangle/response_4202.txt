Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - <2, 8, 0> forms a triangle as 2, 8, and 0 are all connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - <1, 3, 14> forms a triangle as 1, 3, and 14 are all connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 11:
    - <3, 8, 11> forms a triangle as 3, 8, and 11 are all connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

13. Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. Node 14:
    - <1, 3, 14> forms a triangle as 1, 3, and 14 are all connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
