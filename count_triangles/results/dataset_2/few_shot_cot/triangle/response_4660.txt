Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 7 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 0 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 1 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 2 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 2 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [8].
