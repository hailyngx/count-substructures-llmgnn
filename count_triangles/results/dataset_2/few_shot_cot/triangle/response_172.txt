Response:
Following the provided example step-by-step approach to count triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are connected as shown in the provided edge list; 7 and 13 are also 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed: <0, 7, 13>.
    * Pair 4: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping as it has smaller neighboring nodes which already covered it.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping as it has smaller neighboring nodes which already covered it.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 5. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skipping as it has smaller neighboring nodes which already covered it.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed: <0, 7, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skipping as it has smaller neighboring nodes which already covered it.

* Node 9:
    * Skipping as it has smaller neighboring nodes which already covered it.

* Node 10:
    * Skipping as it has smaller neighboring nodes which already covered it.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 11. Triangle formed: <1, 11, 14>.
    * Skipping the rest as they have smaller neighboring nodes which already covered them.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 12. Triangle formed: <0, 10, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skipping as it has smaller neighboring nodes which already covered it.

* Node 14:
    * Skipping as it has smaller neighboring nodes which already covered it.

Summarizing the triangles:

[<0, 7, 13>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <4, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 14>, <1, 11, 14>, <0, 10, 12>]

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [7].
