Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided with the given graph, we can find the number of triangles in the graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected. Continuing to (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
        * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Already considered in Pair 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
        * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are connected. Continuing to (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 9, 12>.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
        * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
        * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Already considered in Node 0.
        * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are connected. Continuing to (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are connected. Triangle formed: <5, 12, 18>.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    Continue this process for Nodes 6 through 19.
