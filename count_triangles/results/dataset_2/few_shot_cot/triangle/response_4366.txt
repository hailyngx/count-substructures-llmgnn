Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 3) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 7, 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 0, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, 7, and node 1

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as demonstrated in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

1. Triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node:
    - No triangles with Node 0.

2. Triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node:
    - No triangles with Node 1.

3. Triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) - 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) - 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node:
    - No triangles with Node 3.

5. Triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node:
    - No triangles with Node 6.

8. Triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node:
    - No triangles with Node 7.

9. Triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node:
    - No triangles with Node 8.

10. Triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
