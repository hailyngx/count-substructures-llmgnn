Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Triangle not possible as 9 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> Triangle not possible as 9 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> Triangle not possible as 6 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Triangle not possible as 9 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Triangle not possible as 9 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> Triangle not possible as 6 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Triangle not possible as 5 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Triangle not possible as 5 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Triangle not possible as 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> Triangle not possible as 5 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> Triangle not possible as 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> Triangle not possible as 4 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (4, 2) -> Triangle not possible as 4 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> Triangle not possible as 4 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (2, 8) -> Triangle not possible as 2 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (2, 7) -> Triangle not possible as 2 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 11: (8, 7) -> Triangle not possible as 8 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
