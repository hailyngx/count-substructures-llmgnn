Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 5 are also connected as (11, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (9, 19), but since 9 and 19 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 11 and 19 are also connected as (11, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than their respective numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
