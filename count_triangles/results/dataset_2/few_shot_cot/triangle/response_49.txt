Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> Both 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 15 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (22, 3) -> Both 22 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 22 and 3 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (14, 9) -> Both 14 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 14 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 3 to 29, accounting for each triangle formed. Finally, sum up the total triangles from each node.

When analyzing the entire graph, the count of triangles for each node is:
Node 0: 0
Node 1: 0
Node 2: 0
Node 3: 0
Node 4: 0
Node 5: 0
Node 6: 0
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 0
Node 9: 0
Node 10: 2
Node 11: 0
Node 12: 4
Node 13: 0
Node 14: 0
Node 15: 2
Node 16: 0
Node 17: 0
Node 18: 0
Node 19: 4
Node 20: 0
Node 21: 0
Node 22: 0
Node 23: 0
Node 24: 0
Node 25: 0
Node 26: 2
Node 27: 6
Node 28: 0
Node 29: 0

Summing up all the triangles from each node, we get:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 4 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 4 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 2 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 4 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 2 (Node 26) + 6 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 20

Therefore, there are 20 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
