Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to iterate through each node and check for triangles that can be formed with that node as the smallest numbered node. Here is the step-by-step process to find the number of triangles present in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
