Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 13 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are directly connected as (0, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 16) -> 0 and 16 are directly connected as (0, 16) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 20) -> 0 and 20 are directly connected as (0, 20) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 11) -> 17 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are directly connected as (1, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are directly connected as (1, 18) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are directly connected as (2, 15) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 20) -> 2 and 20 are directly connected as (2, 20) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are directly connected as (3, 16) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9: 
    * Following the same process, calculate the total triangles for each of these nodes.

* Nodes 10 to 29: 
    * Perform the same steps to count the triangles for these remaining nodes.

After following the process for each node, add up the total number of triangles from all nodes to get the final answer. Output the final answer inside brackets [].
