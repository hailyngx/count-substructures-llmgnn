Response:
Following the step-by-step triangle counting process described in the example for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 14) -> 15 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 21) -> 15 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 8) -> 15 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 21) -> 14 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Only 1 pair available, which is (3, 12). They are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs with nodes smaller than 2 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pairs with nodes smaller than 4 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pairs with nodes smaller than 5 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (5, 20) -> 5 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6 to 29:
    * Skipping these nodes because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summing up the triangles found:
[<14, 18, 0>, <1, 12, 3>, <1, 2, 3>, <10, 23, 11>, <3, 18, 2>, <5, 20, 28>, <7, 15, 29>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
