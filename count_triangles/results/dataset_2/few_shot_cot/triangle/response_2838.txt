Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (20, 28) -> 20 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 20) -> 7 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 24) -> 9 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 24 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 5 or smaller as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2, 3, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (23, 29) -> 23 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 23 and 29 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (18, 25) -> 18 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (13, 22) -> 13 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 13 and 22 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 26:
    * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 27:
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 28:
    * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 29:
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
