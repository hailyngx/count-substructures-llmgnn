Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
