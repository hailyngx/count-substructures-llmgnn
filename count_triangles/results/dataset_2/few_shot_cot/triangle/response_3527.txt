Response:
Following the method outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (11, 18) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (14, 18) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 17) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 17) -> Connected through node 2.
    * Pair 5: (8, 12) -> Connected through node 2.
    * Pair 6: (17, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 15) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 15) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) -> Connected through node 5.
    * Pair 5: (9, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (10, 13) -> Connected through node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and onwards until Node 19:

* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 1 triangle
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 1 triangle
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles (Not connected to any other nodes)
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 1 triangle
* Node 19: 0 triangles

Summing up the total number of triangles:
\[0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0\]

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [6].
The unique triangles found are: <3, 13, 8>, <3, 6, 5>, <8, 17, 2>, <3, 6, 15>, <5, 10, 13>, <10, 13, 18>.
