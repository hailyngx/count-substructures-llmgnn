Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and a direct edge connection exists between them. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and a direct edge connection exists between them. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pairs 1 and 2 involve nodes smaller than 1. Therefore, skip those pairs.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and a direct edge connection exists between them. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs with nodes smaller than 2 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and a direct edge connection exists between them. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but there is no direct edge connection between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs with nodes smaller than 4 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, with a direct edge connection between them. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pairs with nodes smaller than 5 are skipped.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pairs with nodes smaller than 6 are skipped.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pairs with nodes smaller than 7 are skipped.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
