Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 0 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 20) -> 0 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 20 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs including nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs including nodes smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:

    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 20:
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 21:
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 23:
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 24:
    * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 25:
    * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 26:
    * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 27:
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 28:
    * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 29:
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 1 (Node 23) + 1 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [6].
