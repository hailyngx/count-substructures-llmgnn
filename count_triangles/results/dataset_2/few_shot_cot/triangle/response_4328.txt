Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11 (5, 11, 2).
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (11, 5, 2).
    * Pair 6: (10, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    Unique triangles involving Node 0: <5, 11, 2>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (11, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 (14, 5, 8).
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (14, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique triangles involving Node 2: <14, 5, 8>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 (6, 12, 9).
    * Pair 2: (12, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (12, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique triangles involving Node 3: <6, 12, 9>

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (14, 8, 5).
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (14, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (14, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (10, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique triangles involving Node 5: <14, 8, 5>

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Therefore, the final answer is: [5] (total number of triangles)  
Unique triangles found: <5, 11, 2>, <14, 5, 8>, <6, 12, 9>, <14, 8, 5>.
