Response:
Following the step-by-step triangle counting process described in the example using the provided graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 28) -> 17 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller.

* Skipping Nodes 10 through 28 as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each.

* Node 29:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

The final answer is [0].
