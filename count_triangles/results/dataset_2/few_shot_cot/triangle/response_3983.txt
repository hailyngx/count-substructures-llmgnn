Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 0 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 0) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Already counted in Node 0's triangles. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Already counted in Node 0's triangles. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Already counted in Node 3's triangles. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Already counted in Pair 2 above. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

To list the unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 4>, <3, 4, 6>, <5, 6, 9>
