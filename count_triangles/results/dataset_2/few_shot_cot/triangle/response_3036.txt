Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 8 as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> Node 0 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 1 as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Node 1 and Node 7 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12 and Node 18 as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 and Node 3 as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 and Node 3 as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14 and Node 3 as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11 and Node 4 as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 18 and Node 4 as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 4 as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 and Node 5 as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15 and Node 5 as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11 and Node 6 as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10 and Node 7 as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 7 as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 7 as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 7 as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17 and Node 8 as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 8 as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as they are used in previous calculations.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 4 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) = 19.

Therefore, there are 19 triangles in the given graph.
