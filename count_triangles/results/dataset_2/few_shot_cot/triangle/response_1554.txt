Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - <0, 5, 7>
    - No other triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - No triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - <2, 6, 7>
    - No other triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Node 10:
    - No triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 11:
    - No triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. Node 12:
    - No triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 13:
    - No triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. Node 14:
    - No triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

[<0, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 7>]
