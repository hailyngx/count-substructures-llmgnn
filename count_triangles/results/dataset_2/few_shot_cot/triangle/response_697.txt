Response:
Following the example provided, we will now compute the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 19 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 5: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (17, 19) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 13) -> 17 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (17, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [13].
