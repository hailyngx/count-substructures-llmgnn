Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided and applying it to the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Node 10, 13, and 4 form a triangle <10, 13, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (22, 24) -> Nodes 22, 24, and 0 form a triangle <22, 24, 0>.
    * Pair 3: (0, 28) -> Nodes 0, 28, and 26 form a triangle <0, 28, 26>.
    * Pair 4: (0, 10) -> Node 0, 10, and 15 form a triangle <0, 10, 15>.
    * Pair 5: (0, 13) -> Node 0, 13, and 4 form a triangle <0, 13, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Already counted when processing Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (13, 20) -> Nodes 13, 20, and 6 form a triangle <13, 20, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 23) -> Nodes 4, 23, and 25 form a triangle <4, 23, 25>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 20) -> Already counted when processing Node 4.
    * No other valid triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 27) -> Nodes 8, 27, and 3 form a triangle <8, 27, 3>.
    * No other valid triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 4) -> Already counted when processing Node 0.
    * No other valid triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> Already counted when processing Node 0.
    * No other valid triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.
  
* Nodes 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered nodes.

* Node 23:
    * Pair 1: (4, 25) -> Nodes 4, 25, and 23 form a triangle <4, 25, 23>.
    * No other valid triangles can be formed with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 24:
    * Pair 1: (0, 22) -> Nodes 0, 22, and 9 form a triangle <0, 22, 9>.
    * No other valid triangles can be formed with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 23) + 1 (Node 24) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are <10, 13, 4>, <22, 24, 0>, <0, 28, 26>, <0, 10, 15>, <13, 20, 6>, <4, 23, 25>, <8, 27, 3>, <4, 25, 23>, and <0, 22, 9>.

Hence, the final answer is [9].
