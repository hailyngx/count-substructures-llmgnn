Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip pair (1, 4) as they are both smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Already counted with Node 0.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip pair (5, 1) as they are both smaller than 8.
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>.
