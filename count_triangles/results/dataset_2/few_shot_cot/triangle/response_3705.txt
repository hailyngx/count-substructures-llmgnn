    * Skip any pair containing nodes smaller than 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No edges connected to Node 19, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
