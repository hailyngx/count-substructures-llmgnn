Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> Connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> Not connected directly in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Not connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> Not connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> Not connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (10, 7) -> Connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (10, 6) -> Connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 6) -> Connected directly in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Not connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 5) -> Connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 2) -> Not connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (14, 5) -> Not connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (14, 2) -> Not connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 2) -> Connected directly in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (13, 11) -> Connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 5) -> Not connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 2) -> Not connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 5) -> Connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (11, 2) -> Not connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 2) -> Connected directly in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 9) -> Not connected directly in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 9) -> Connected directly in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
