Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, I will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 18) -> Triangle formed as 2, 5, and 18 form a triangle.
    * Pair 7: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed.

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 4) -> No triangle formed.

    * No triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2)

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph, which consists of nodes 2, 5, and 18 (<2, 5, 18>).
