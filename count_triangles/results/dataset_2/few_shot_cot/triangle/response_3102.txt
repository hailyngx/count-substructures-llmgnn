Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 14 are also connected as (0, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 3 are also connected as (0, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 7) -> 10 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (2, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 3) -> 14 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (14, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (4, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (4, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (4, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each one of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [10].
