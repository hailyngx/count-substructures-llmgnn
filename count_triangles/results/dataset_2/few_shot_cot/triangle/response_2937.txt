Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 2: (11, 18) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 3: (16, 18) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 3: (17, 19) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
  
* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 3: (2, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (19, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (19, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 2: (6, 18) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 3: (17, 18) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> No triangle formed.

    * Pair 3: (9, 19) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 4: (17, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no connections.

    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 5: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 6: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 3: (15, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Let's continue this process for Nodes 11 to 19.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (0, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 18) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 3: (16, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as there are not enough connections.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 5) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 3: (10, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 3: (15, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
