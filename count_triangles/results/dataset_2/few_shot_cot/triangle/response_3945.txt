Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are directly connected and are also 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    - No triangle to form.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 7.
    - Pair 2: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
- Node 9:
    - No triangles to form.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
- Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are directly connected but are not 1-hop neighbors of 10. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
- Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are directly connected but are not 1-hop neighbors of 11. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
- Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
- Node 13:
    - No triangles to form.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
- Node 14:
    - No triangles to form.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
