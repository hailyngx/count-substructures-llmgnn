Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (27, 4) -> Connected to Node 4. Form a triangle with this pair.
    * Pair 2: (27, 19) -> Connected to Node 19. Form a triangle with this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Connected to Node 6 and Node 10. Form a triangle with this pair.
    * Pair 2: (6, 23) -> Connected to Node 6 and Node 23. No triangle formed with this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (18, 6) -> Connected to Node 18 and Node 6. Form a triangle with this pair.
    * Pair 2: (18, 10) -> Connected to Node 18 and Node 10. No triangle formed with this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (16, 27) -> Connected to Node 16 and Node 27. Form a triangle with this pair.
    * Pair 2: (16, 22) -> Connected to Node 16 and Node 22. No triangle formed with this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (12, 8) -> Connected to Node 12 and Node 8. Form a triangle with this pair.
    * Pair 2: (12, 28) -> Connected to Node 12 and Node 28. No triangle formed with this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> Connected to Node 16 and Node 18. Form a triangle with this pair.
    * Pair 2: (16, 1) -> Connected to Node 16 and Node 1. Form a triangle with this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (26, 24) -> Connected to Node 26 and Node 24. Form a triangle with this pair.
    * Pair 2: (26, 14) -> Connected to Node 26 and Node 14. No triangle formed with this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (12, 5) -> Connected to Node 12 and Node 5. No triangle formed with this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (26, 24) -> Connected to Node 26 and Node 24. Form a triangle with this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (23, 1) -> Connected to Node 23 and Node 1. Form a triangle with this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Now, we will repeat the process for Nodes 11 to 29 to find the total number of triangles in the graph.
