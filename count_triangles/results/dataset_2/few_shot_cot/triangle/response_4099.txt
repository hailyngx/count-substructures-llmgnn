Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Connected through node 0, forms a triangle with node 10. <7, 0, 14>
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> Connected through node 0, but no third connection for a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> Connected through node 0, forms a triangle with node 9. <7, 0, 13>
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> Connected through node 0, but no third connection for a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (14, 10) -> Connected through node 0, but no third connection for a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (14, 13) -> Connected through node 0, but no third connection for a triangle.
    * Pair 7: (14, 9) -> Connected through node 0, but no third connection for a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> Both are connected through node 1, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Connected through node 1, forms a triangle with node 4. <7, 1, 9>
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> Connected through node 1, forms a triangle with node 10. <7, 1, 12>
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Both are connected through node 1, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> Connected through node 1, forms a triangle with node 8. <3, 1, 9>
    * Pair 6: (3, 12) -> Connected through node 1, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 8) -> Connected through node 1, forms a triangle with node 5. <3, 1, 8>
    * Pair 8: (9, 12) -> Connected through node 1, but no third connection for a triangle.
    * Pair 9: (9, 8) -> Connected through node 1, forms a triangle with node 5. <9, 1, 8>
    * Pair 10: (12, 8) -> Connected through node 1, forms a triangle with node 10. <12, 1, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both are connected through node 2, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> Connected through node 2, forms a triangle with node 6. <4, 2, 11>
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> Connected through node 2, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both are connected through node 3, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> Connected through node 3, forms a triangle with node 6. <8, 3, 5>
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Connected through node 3, forms a triangle with node 4. <8, 3, 9>
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Connected through node 3, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Both are connected through node 4, forms a triangle with node 0. <9, 4, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Connected through node 6, forms a triangle with node 0. <10, 6, 14>
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> Connected through node 6, forms a triangle with node 1. <10, 6, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* The process for Nodes 7 to 14 is similar.
* Total number of triangles = Sum of triangles for all nodes.
* The answer would be the total number of triangles in brackets [].
