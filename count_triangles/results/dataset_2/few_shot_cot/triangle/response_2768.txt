Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) - No edge between 7 and 12, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) - No edge between 7 and 16, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 19) - No edge between 7 and 19, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 16) - No edge between 12 and 16, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 19) - No edge between 12 and 19, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 19) - No edge between 16 and 19, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) - No edge between 13 and 15, so no triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is: [2].
