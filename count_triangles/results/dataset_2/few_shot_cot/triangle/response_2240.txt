Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 2, 3>
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Node 4)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected, but 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13: <2, 12, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Node 13)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <0, 3, 5>
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11: <3, 9, 11>
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (Node 5, Node 11)

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14: <4, 9, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Node 14)

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <0, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Node 3)

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14: <4, 12, 14>
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Node 14)

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with at least two nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:

Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. [6]
