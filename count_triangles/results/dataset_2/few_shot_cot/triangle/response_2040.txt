    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (17, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:

    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No possible pairs for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No possible pairs for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the total number of triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
