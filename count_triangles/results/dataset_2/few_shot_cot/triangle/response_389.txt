Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> Both 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 5) -> Both 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
