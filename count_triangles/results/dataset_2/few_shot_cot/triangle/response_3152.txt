Response:
Following the same method as described in the example provided: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they share a common neighbor 9. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 1>
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 6>
    * Pair 6: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
        
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 9, 7>
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 9, 3>
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 9, 6>
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3
        
* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 7, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        
* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 9, 4>
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 7>
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 1, 9>
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 1, 6>
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 5
        
* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 9 as it is smaller than 5.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <6, 9, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        
* Node 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 5 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
