Response:
Following the example provided, let's analyze each node to find the total number of triangles:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (6, 16) - Both 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (6, 1) - Both 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (16, 1) - Both 16 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (0, 9) - Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (0, 2) - Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (0, 14) - Both 0 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (2, 9) - Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (2, 14) - Both 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 2:
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (7, 13) - Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of node 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (7, 14) - Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (13, 14) - Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (8, 13) - Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of node 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (15, 19) - Both 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of node 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (15, 9) - Both 15 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (15, 7) - Both 15 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (15, 6) - Both 15 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of node 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (4, 12) - Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of node 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of node 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Nodes 10 to 19:
            * Since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than any of these nodes, we skip these cases.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

        Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
