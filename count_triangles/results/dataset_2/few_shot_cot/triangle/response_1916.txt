Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 25) -> 13 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.

Summarizing the total number of triangles in the graph:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 20) + 1 (Node 21) + 2 (Node 22) + 1 (Node 23) + 1 (Node 24) + 7 (Node 25) + 5 (Node 26) + 1 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 1 (Node 29) = 27.
