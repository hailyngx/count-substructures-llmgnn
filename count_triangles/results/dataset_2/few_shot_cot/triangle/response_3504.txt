Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's go ahead and count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 6: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are indirectly connected through Node 0, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 7: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 9: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 7: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 8: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9: 
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
