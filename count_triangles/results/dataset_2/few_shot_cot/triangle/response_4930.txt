Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> Both 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> Both 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (16, 11) -> Both 16 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 17) -> Both 3 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 17) -> Both 8 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11:
    * These nodes have smaller numbered nodes that have already been considered. Moving on to the next nodes.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> Both 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 19) -> Both 14 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 13 and 14:
    * These nodes have smaller numbered nodes that have already been considered. Moving on to the next nodes.

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 15.
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> Both 10 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * These nodes have smaller numbered nodes that have already been considered. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 15) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
