Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are directly connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are directly connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are directly connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9:
    * The remaining nodes do not have enough larger nodes to form triangles with, so we skip them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
