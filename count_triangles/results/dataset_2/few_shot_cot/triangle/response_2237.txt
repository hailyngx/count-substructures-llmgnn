Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Form a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Form a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> Form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> Form a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> Form a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 0) -> Form a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 6: (0, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Proceeding with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
