Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 20) -> 7 and 20 are directly connected.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 and 1 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are directly connected.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are directly connected.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 and 5 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 22) -> 3 and 22 are directly connected.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 29) -> 4 and 29 are directly connected.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, and 9 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Moving on to the nodes with higher numbers:

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with them as the smallest numbered node because there are no nodes with higher numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = [15].

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
