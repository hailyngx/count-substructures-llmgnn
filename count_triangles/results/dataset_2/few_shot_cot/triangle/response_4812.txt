Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (6, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (3, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (6, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (7, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
