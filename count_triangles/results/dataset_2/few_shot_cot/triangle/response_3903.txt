Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 28) - Both 1 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) - Both 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 19) - Both 1 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (28, 11) - Both 28 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (28, 19) - Both 28 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skipping pairs involving nodes smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (14, 9) - Both 14 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 29:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0)
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
