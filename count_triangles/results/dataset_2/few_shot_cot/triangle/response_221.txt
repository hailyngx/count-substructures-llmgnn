Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 26) -> 10 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 29) -> 12 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8: Skipped as they have been accounted for in the previous pairs.

Continuing this process for all nodes in the graph:

* Node 9: 
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 4
* Node 10: 
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 11: 
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 12: 
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 13: 
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 14: 
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 15: 
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 16: 
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 17: 
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 18: 
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 2
* Node 19: 
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 20: 
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 21:
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 22:
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 23:
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 24:
    * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 25:
    * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 26:
    * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 27: 
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 28: 
    * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 29: 
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
