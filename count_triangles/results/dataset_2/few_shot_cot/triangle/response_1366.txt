    * Pair 11: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and with node 7 they form a triangle <1, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and with node 1 they form a triangle <1, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and with node 0 they form a triangle <0, 3, 1>.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and with node 1 they form a triangle <1, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and with node 1 they form a triangle <1, 0, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and with node 3 they form a triangle <3, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 3 or are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
