Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Triangle formed as both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) - Triangle formed as both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) - Triangle formed as both 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) - Triangle formed as both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Triangle formed as both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - Triangle formed as both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) - Triangle formed as both 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) - No triangle formed as 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Triangle formed as both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) - No triangle formed as 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) - Triangle formed as both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) - Triangle formed as both 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - No triangle formed as 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) - Triangle formed as both 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - Triangle formed as both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) - No triangle formed as 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - No triangle formed as 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) - Triangle formed as both 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) - No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 13

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
