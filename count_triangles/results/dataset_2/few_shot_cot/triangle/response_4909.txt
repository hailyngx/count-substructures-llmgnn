Response:
Following the step-by-step process as demonstrated in the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 27) -> 7 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (7, 27) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 27) -> 21 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 21) -> 8 and 21 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (27, 15) -> 27 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (27, 19) -> 27 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 3) -> 13 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (13, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 3) -> 17 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (17, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 28) -> 15 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (15, 28) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs including Nodes <= 4 since they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (8, 11) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 6 through 29 to determine the total number of triangles in the graph. Then provide the final answer inside brackets [] with unique triangles listed inside <> such as <1, 2, 3>.
