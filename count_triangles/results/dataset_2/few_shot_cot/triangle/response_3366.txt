Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Nodes 1 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangle formed with any other node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Nodes 1 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

9. Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangle formed with any other node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
