Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than their numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, there are [7 triangles] in the given graph.
