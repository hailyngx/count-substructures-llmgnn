Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the same process as explained in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed with node 6.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> Triangle formed with node 4.
    * Pair 6: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 0) -> Triangle formed with node 6.
    * Pair 8: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 3.
    * Pair 10: (6, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (9, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 7.
    * Pair 3: (2, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 7 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 6 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 0.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 6 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as no other nodes are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
