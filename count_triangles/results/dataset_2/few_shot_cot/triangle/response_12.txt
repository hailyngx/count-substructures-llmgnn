Response:
Following the step-by-step triangle counting process for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are connected as (9, 10). No third node shares edges with both 9 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected as (9, 12). No third node shares edges with both 9 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Similar to Node 0, no triangles are formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8). No third node shares edges with both 7 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are connected as (5, 13). No third node shares edges with both 5 and 13. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are connected as (5, 4). No third node shares edges with both 5 and 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are connected as (5, 1). The third node 10 shares edges with both 5 and 1. Triangle <1, 5, 10> formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are connected as (5, 14). The third node 11 shares edges with both 5 and 14. Triangle <5, 11, 14> formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 4) -> 13 and 4 are connected as (13, 4). No third node shares edges with both 13 and 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Similar to Nodes 0 and 1, no triangles are formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip connections to nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles are formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are connected as (10, 8). No third node shares edges with both 10 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are connected as (9, 3). No third node shares edges with both 9 and 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    Due to the lack of at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes, they do not form any triangles as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
