Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Neither 1 nor 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) - 1 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) - 4 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) - 3 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) - 2 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) - 9 and 12 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) - 7 and 11 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) - 9 and 10 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) - 8 and 14 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) - 9 and 13 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) - 4 and 10 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 9. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No possible triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11: No possible triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12: No possible triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13: No possible triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14: No possible triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
