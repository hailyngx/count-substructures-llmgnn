Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node, we calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (14, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (14, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (10, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
