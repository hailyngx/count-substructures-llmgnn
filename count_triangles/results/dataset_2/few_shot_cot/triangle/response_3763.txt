Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - No triangle as 6 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - No triangle as 6 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipping Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) - No triangle as 6 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) - No triangle as 6 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skipping all smaller nodes. No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping all smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) - No triangle as 5 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) - No triangle as 6 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) - No triangle as 6 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skipping other smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
