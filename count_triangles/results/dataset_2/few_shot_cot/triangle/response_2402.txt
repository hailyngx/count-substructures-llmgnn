Response:
Following the same process as shown in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no larger numbered nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Node 5 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * All have 1-hop neighbors that are larger and can form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up all the triangles for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 9, 12>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 11, 13>, <5, 7, 9>, <7, 9, 12>, <0, 2, 7>, <4, 11, 13>, <11, 13, 4>

So, the final answer is [8].
