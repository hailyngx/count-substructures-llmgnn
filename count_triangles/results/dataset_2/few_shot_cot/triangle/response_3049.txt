Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) - Both 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) - Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (5, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) - Both 11 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (11, 17) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) - Both 16 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (16, 19) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 5) - Both 10 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as (10, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) - Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 13) - Both 14 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as (14, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) - Both 16 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected as (16, 17) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (15, 10) - Both 15 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also directly connected as (15, 10) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
