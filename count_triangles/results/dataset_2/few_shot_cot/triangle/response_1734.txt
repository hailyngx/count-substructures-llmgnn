Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3

Node 2 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - 1 and 3 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) - 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) - 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
