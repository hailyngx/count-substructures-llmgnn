Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 29) -> 0 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (29, 0) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: No triangle formed with other pairs.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (9, 16) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: No triangle formed with other pairs.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (5, 16) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: No triangle formed with other pairs.

* Node 10:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 14:

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 20:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 21:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 22:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 23:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.

* Node 24:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 25:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.

* Node 26:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 27:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 28:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with any pair.

* Node 29:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
