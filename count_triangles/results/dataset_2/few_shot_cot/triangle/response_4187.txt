Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) <3, 4, 0>
    - Pair 2: (4, 15) → Skipped (Node 15 is greater than Node 0).
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (13, 19) → Skipped (Node 19 is greater than Node 1).
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 14) <2, 4, 14>
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 4) → Skipped (Both 0 and 4 are smaller than Node 3).
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (9, 15) <4, 9, 15>
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - There are no other nodes greater than 5 to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 19) → Skipped (Both 3 and 19 are smaller than Node 6).
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - There are no other nodes greater than 7 to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (9, 17) → Skipped (Both 9 and 17 are smaller than Node 8).
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (15, 4) <9, 15, 4>
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (12, 2) <10, 12, 2>
    - Pair 2: (12, 5) → Skipped (Node 5 is greater than Node 10).
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (16, 13) → Skipped (Both 16 and 13 are smaller than Node 11).
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (1, 18) → Skipped (Both 1 and 18 are smaller than Node 12).
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (16, 19) → Skipped (Both 16 and 19 are smaller than Node 13).
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) <14, 3, 8>
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    - There are no other nodes greater than 15 to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) <16, 9, 13>
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    - There are no other nodes greater than 17 to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    - There are no other nodes greater than 18 to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) <19, 5, 6>
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
[<3, 4, 0>, <2, 4, 14>, <4, 9, 15>, <10, 12, 2>, <14, 3, 8>, <16, 9, 13>, <19, 5, 6>]

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
