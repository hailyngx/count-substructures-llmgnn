Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (12, 8) -> 12 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 4:
        * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Proceed similarly with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to count the total number of triangles.

Upon completing the calculations for all nodes, you can sum up the total triangles. 
Finally, output the total number of triangles inside brackets [] and list the unique triangles found inside <> each only once in the answer.
