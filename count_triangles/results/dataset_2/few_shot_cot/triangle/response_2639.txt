Response:
Following the same process outlined above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 but are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7 but are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8 but are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9 and connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10 but are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11 but are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12 and connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs as there is only one connected node with a larger number than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
