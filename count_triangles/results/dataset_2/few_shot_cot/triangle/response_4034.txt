Response:
Following the same process as described in the example above, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 10 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Similar process as above.

* Skipping nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19 as they either have smaller adjacent nodes or too few higher numbered nodes to form triangles.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 18, and 16 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (16, 0) -> 16 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 18, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 18, and 0 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + Count for the remaining nodes = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
