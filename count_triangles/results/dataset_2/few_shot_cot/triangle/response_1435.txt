Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No direct edge between 9 and 13. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> No direct edge between 9 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> No direct edge between 9 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 3) -> No direct edge between 9 and 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 14) -> No direct edge between 13 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 10) -> No direct edge between 13 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (13, 3) -> Direct edge between 13 and 3. Triangle formed: <0, 13, 3>.
    * Pair 8: (14, 10) -> Direct edge between 14 and 10. Triangle formed: <0, 14, 10>.
    * Pair 9: (14, 3) -> Direct edge between 14 and 3. Triangle formed: <0, 14, 3>.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pairs involving (6, 1) and (1, 2) are skipped as 1 is smaller than both 6 and 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> No direct edge between 1 and 13. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> No direct edge between 1 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> No direct edge between 1 and 4. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that include Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Direct edge between 9 and 8. Triangle formed: <2, 9, 8>.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 12) -> Direct edge between 13 and 12. Triangle formed: <3, 13, 12>.
    * Pair 2: (13, 0) -> Direct edge between 13 and 0. Triangle formed: <3, 13, 0>.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> No direct edge between 13 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 14) -> Direct edge between 12 and 14. Triangle formed: <3, 12, 14>.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5 to 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5-14) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
