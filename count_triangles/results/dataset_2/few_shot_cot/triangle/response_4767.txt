Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 5, and 6:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (6, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
