Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (19, 29) -> 19 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (29, 12) -> 29 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (19, 21) -> 19 and 21 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 28) -> 19 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 5: (28, 10) -> 28 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * The rest of the pairs involving Node 2 are smaller than Node 2 itself, so we skip them.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
