Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 18), forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 22) -> 4 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 25) -> 4 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (19, 22) -> 19 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    * Pair 4: (19, 25) -> 19 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 29) -> 7 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (26, 29) -> 26 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (26, 29), forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (16, 24) -> 16 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (16, 25) -> 16 and 26 are directly connected as (16, 25), but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3, so no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (24, 25) -> 24 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (12, 21) -> 12 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 22) -> 1 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * No pairs to consider. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 29) -> 9 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (9, 10), forming a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 to Node 29:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes smaller than 8 or pairs where at least one Node is smaller than 8.
    * No more pairs left to consider. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8 to 29) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
