Response:
Following the provided instructions, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 because it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (16, 22) -> 16 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (18, 22) -> 18 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 26) -> 4 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 23) -> 7 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No edges connected to Node 5. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 23) -> 11 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (17, 21) -> 17 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (17, 26) -> 17 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (10, 24) -> 10 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (24, 26) -> 24 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.
 
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 6.
