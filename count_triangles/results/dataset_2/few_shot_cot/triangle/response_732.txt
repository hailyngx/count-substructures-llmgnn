Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 1: <0, 9, 4>
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <2, 5, 4>
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <2, 5, 3>
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 3: <3, 9, 11>
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 3: <2, 9, 3>
    * Pair 4: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <4, 7, 5>
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <4, 7, 8>
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <4, 7, 12>
    * Pair 4: (0, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <0, 4, 7>
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <4, 8, 5>
    * Pair 6: (4, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <2, 4, 5>
    * Pair 7: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 5: <5, 9, 7>
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 5: <5, 9, 8>
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 5: <2, 5, 9>
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 5: <5, 7, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 7: <4, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The calculation for the remaining nodes is skipped, as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 6 (Node 4) + 4 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Remaining Nodes) = 16.

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [16].
