Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided above, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 13) -> Node 9 and node 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 10) -> Node 9 and node 10 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 1) -> Node 9 and node 1 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (13, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (13, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (10, 1) -> Node 10 and node 1 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as there are no 2-hop neighbors greater than Node 1 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as there are no 2-hop neighbors greater than Node 2 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 12) -> Node 11 and node 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (11, 2) -> Node 11 and node 2 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (14, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (14, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (12, 2) -> Node 12 and node 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 11, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 11, 12>)

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Node 5 and node 9 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Node 5 and node 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) -> Node 9 and node 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 2) -> Node 13 and node 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as there are no 2-hop neighbors greater than Node 5 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Node 7 and node 13 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 3) -> Node 13 and node 3 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 12) -> Node 13 and node 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (13, 2) -> Node 13 and node 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 12) -> Node 3 and node 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (12, 2) -> Node 12 and node 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 11, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 11, 12>)

* Node 7:
    * Skipped as there are no 2-hop neighbors greater than Node 7 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 to 14:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than Nodes 8 to 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8 to 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
