Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 2: <0, 1, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 2: <0, 2, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 and Node 2: <1, 2, 0>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 5: <1, 5, 4>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 and Node 7: <1, 7, 0>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip triangles with Node 0 and Node 1 as they are smaller.
    * No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 5: <4, 5, 1>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 7: <4, 7, 1>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 9: <4, 9, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 and Node 3: <9, 3, 0>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 4: <9, 4, 1>.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 8: <9, 8, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
