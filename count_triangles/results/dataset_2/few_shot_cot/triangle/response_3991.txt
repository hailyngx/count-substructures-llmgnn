Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with nodes 0, 5, and 9.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed with nodes 0, 8, and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with nodes 1, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Already counted in previous pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> Triangle formed with nodes 1, 4, and 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes. No triangles formed.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 1) -> Triangle formed with nodes 1, 9, and 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No pairs can be formed with at least 2 other nodes greater than Node 10. No triangles formed.

* Node 11:
    * No pairs can be formed with at least 2 other nodes greater than Node 11. No triangles formed.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs can be formed with at least 2 other nodes greater than Node 13. No triangles formed.

* Node 14:
    * No pairs can be formed with at least 2 other nodes greater than Node 14. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
