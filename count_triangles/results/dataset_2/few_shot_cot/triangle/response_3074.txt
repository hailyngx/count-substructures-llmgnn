Response:
Following the same methodology as described in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (14, 10) - 14 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (14, 19) - 14 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 19 are connected as (0, 19) in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (10, 19) - 10 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 
        
    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 12) - 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 12) in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (3, 15) - 3 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (3, 6) - No triangle formed as 6 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 1.
        * Pair 4: (3, 4) - No triangle formed as 4 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 1.
        * Pair 5: (12, 15) - No triangle formed as 15 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 1.
        * Pair 6: (12, 6) - 12 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (12, 6) in the edge list.
        * Pair 7: (12, 4) - No triangle formed as 4 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 1.
        * Pair 8: (15, 6) - 15 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 9: (15, 4) - No triangle formed as 4 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 1.
        * Pair 10: (6, 4) - 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 4) in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
        
    Continue this process for Nodes 2 to 19.

    * Total triangles in the graph = Sum of triangles for each node
