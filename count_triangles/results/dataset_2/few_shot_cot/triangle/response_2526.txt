Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle possible since 1 and 2 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are directly connected, but they do not have a common neighbor for a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle possible since 1 and 5 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 4: (1, 10) -> No triangle possible since 1 and 10 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 5: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are directly connected, but they do not have a common neighbor for a triangle.
    - Pair 6: (1, 4) -> This pair is a duplicate and was previously checked.
    - Pair 7: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are directly connected, but they do not have a common neighbor for a triangle.
    - Pair 8: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are directly connected, but they do not have a common neighbor for a triangle.
    - Pair 9: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are directly connected, but they do not have a common neighbor for a triangle.
    - Pair 10: (2, 11) -> No triangle possible since 2 and 11 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 11: (2, 4) -> This pair is a duplicate and was previously checked.
    - Pair 12: (2, 5) -> This pair is a duplicate and was previously checked.
    - Pair 13: (2, 10) -> This pair is a duplicate and was previously checked.
    - Pair 14: (2, 11) -> This pair is a duplicate and was previously checked.
    - Pair 15: (5, 10) -> No triangle possible since 5 and 10 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 16: (5, 11) -> No triangle possible since 5 and 11 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 17: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are directly connected, but they do not have a common neighbor for a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Time to calculate the total number of triangles in this graph following the same process for each node and then summing them to get the final count. Let's continue with Node 1.
