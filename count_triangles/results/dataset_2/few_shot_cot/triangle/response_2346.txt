Response:
Applying the same process as demonstrated in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 22) -> 17 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 17 and 22 are also connected as (0, 22) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (23, 27) -> 23 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 9 are connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 27) -> 9 and 27 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (9, 27) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * Following the same steps as above, we find no triangles involving these nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 19 are connected as (9, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 10 (Nodes 2, 0).
    * Pair 1: (28, 26) -> 26 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 26 and 28 are also connected as (26, 28) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 20) -> 11 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 12 to 29:
    * Following the same process for the remaining nodes, we find no additional triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0
* Total triangles in the graph = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
