Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are connected by an edge (0, 2) and are 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are connected by an edge (0, 10) and are 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected by an edge (4, 7).
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected by an edge (9, 3).
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Proceeding with the same process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as all 1-hop neighbors of 9 are smaller in value.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs as all 1-hop neighbors of 10 are smaller in value.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4

Therefore, there are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 6, 10>
<2, 4, 7>
