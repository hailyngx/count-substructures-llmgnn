Response:
Following the same approach as in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 4) -> 15 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 15 and 4 are also connected as (15, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they share no common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they share no common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 10)  + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.         

The triangles are: <0, 4, 15>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 8, 10>, <2, 10, 11>, <2, 8, 11>, <4, 0, 15>, <7, 17, 18>, <10, 12, 14>, <12, 14, 16>, <15, 0, 4>, <17, 7, 18>.

The final answer is [11].
