Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 14 are also connected as (2, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 14 are also connected as (3, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (7, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> Both 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 13 are directly connected as (3, 13) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 4 for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 5 for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there are not enough nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3 to 14) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
