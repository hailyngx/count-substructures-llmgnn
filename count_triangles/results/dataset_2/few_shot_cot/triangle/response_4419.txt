Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 16.

Therefore, there are [16] triangles in the given graph.
