Response:
Following the example provided, let's identify the triangles in this graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed: <2, 6, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed: <4, 6, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 17

Therefore, there are [17] triangles in the given graph.
