Response:
Following the examples given earlier:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 20) -> 2 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (2, 20) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 22) -> 9 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 22) -> 2 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 26) -> 8 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (8, 26) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2. 
    * Pair 1: (15, 26) -> 15 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (2, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 28) -> 16 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (16, 28) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (16, 7) -> 16 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (15, 23) -> 15 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as (15, 23) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 29) -> 5 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (20, 18) -> 20 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (7, 10) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10: 
    * Skipped for the same reasons explained earlier in all examples.

Calculating the total triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Nodes 9 and 10) = 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
