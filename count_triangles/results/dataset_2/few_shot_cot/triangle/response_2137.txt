Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph provided:

*Node 0:
- Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected to Node 0, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
- Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are directly connected to Node 0, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 1:
- Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
- Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are directly connected to Node 1, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 2:
- Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected to Node 2, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 3:
- Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are directly connected to Node 3, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 4:
- Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are directly connected to Node 4, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 5:
- Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 3 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
- Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

*Node 6:
- Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are directly connected to Node 6, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 7:
- Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 7.
- Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 8:
- Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
- Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 9:
- Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected to Node 9, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
*Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.*

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
