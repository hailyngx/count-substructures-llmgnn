Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will now determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Start by examining each node and the possible triangles it can form:
   
    - Node 0:
        - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 1:
        - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 2:
        - Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 4 are connected as (0, 4) in the edge list.
        - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    - Node 3:
        - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 4:
        - Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 12 are connected as (12, 5) in the edge list.
        - Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (13, 5).
        - Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (12, 13).
        - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    - Node 5:
        - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 6:
        - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 7:
        - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 8:
        - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 9:
        - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 10:
        - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 11:
        - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 12:
        - Pair 1: (14, 4) -> 14 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected as (14, 4) in the edge list.
        - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    - Node 13:
        - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 14:
        - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Summarizing the triangles found for each smallest numbered node:
    - Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 12) = 5

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
