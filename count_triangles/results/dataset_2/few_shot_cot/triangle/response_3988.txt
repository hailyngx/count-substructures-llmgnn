Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for counting triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (10, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (12, 0) - 12 is connected to 0 and shares a neighbor (3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (12, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 12, 2>, <3, 0, 12>, <3, 2, 10>, <5, 10, 12>, <5, 12, 7>, <5, 7, 14>, and <9, 5, 14>.
The final answer is [7].
