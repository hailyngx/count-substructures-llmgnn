    * Pair 2: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 10) -> 11 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are both connected through (3, 2) and (2, 18).
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 0) -> 18 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:

    * Pair 2: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * There are no connected nodes to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are connected as shown in the edge list.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller.
    * There are no connected nodes to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * There are no connected nodes to form triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11 to 19:
    * Skipped since they have fewer than 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
