Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (0, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 3 are also connected as (5, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 14 are connected as (7, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Unable to form a triangle with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Since we have found the triangles for each node, let's calculate the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles found for each node:

Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [4].
