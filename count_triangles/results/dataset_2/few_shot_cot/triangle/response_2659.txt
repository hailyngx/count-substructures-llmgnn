Response:
Following the step-by-step approach provided in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * ...

Continue this process for every node, calculating the number of triangles with that node as the smallest numbered node. After completing the calculations for all nodes, sum up the total number of triangles found:

* Total triangles in the graph = Calculated triangles for Node 0 + Calculated triangles for Node 1 + ... + Calculated triangles for Node 14

Once you have gone through this process for all nodes and summed up the total triangles, please provide the final answer inside brackets.
