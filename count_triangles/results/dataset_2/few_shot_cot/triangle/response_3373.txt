Response:
Following the steps from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> <2, 6, 4> Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 8: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 9: (3, 1) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 10: (2, 1) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
