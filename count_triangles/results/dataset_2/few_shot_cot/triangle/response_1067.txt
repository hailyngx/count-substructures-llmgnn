Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 
    * Node 0: 3
    * Node 1: 2
    * Node 2: 1
    * Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9: 0  

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
