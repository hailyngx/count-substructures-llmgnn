Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (19, 28) -> Both 19 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 1) -> Both 19 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (1, 19). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> Both 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 2.
