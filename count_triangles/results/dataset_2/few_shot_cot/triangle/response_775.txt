Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
