Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Triangle formed: <1, 6, 10>
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> Triangle formed: <1, 8, 4>
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 13) -> Triangle formed: <1, 13, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pairs with nodes smaller than 2 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Triangle formed: <6, 1, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Triangle formed: <7, 13, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 11:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 12:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 13:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 14:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
