Response:
Following the examples provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Connected through edge (1, 9). Node 1 is connected to Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> No direct edge between 9 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Connected through edge (3, 9). Node 3 is connected to Node 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No direct edge between 9 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> No direct edge between 11 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> No direct edge between 11 and 13. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 10) -> No direct edge between 11 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Connected through edge (1, 9). Node 1 is connected to Node 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No direct edge between 9 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> No direct edge between 8 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> No direct edge between 8 and 13. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node : 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Connected through edge (14, 9). Node 14 is connected to Node 5. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:

* Node 6: 
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7: 
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8: 
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9: 
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10: 
    * No triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11: 
    * No triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12: 
    * No triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14: 
    * No triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
