Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 22) -> 13 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (13, 22) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are not directly connected although they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 as shown in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 19) -> 22 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no 1-hop neighbors greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 22) -> 8 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (8, 22) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (10, 27) -> 10 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (10, 27) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no 1-hop neighbors greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue the same process for Nodes 5 to 29. Finally, count the total number of triangles.

Please remember to list the unique triangles found in the format <...> when providing the final answer.
