Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Checking for the third node to complete the triangle.
