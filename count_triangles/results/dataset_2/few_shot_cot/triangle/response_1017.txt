Response:
Following the procedure illustrated in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 3.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
