Response:
Following the step-by-step approach to count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 21) -> 11 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 21) -> 13 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (21, 6) -> 21 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17, 18, 19, and 20:
    * No triangles can be formed as these nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them for triangle formation.

* Node 21:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 22:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 26:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 27:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 28 and 29:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
