Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are not connected because (3, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge (3, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 0) and (0, 16) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge (6, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 2) -> 16 and 2 are not connected because (16, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pairs already covered when analyzing Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 25) -> 3 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 25) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:

    * Pair 2: (12, 20) -> 12 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (12, 20) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 10) -> 11 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* The process will continue for the remaining nodes.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:

[<0, 3, 6>, <2, 0, 3>, <8, 12, 20>]

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
