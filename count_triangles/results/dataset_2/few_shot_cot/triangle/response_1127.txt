Response:
Following the same steps as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> Formed a triangle with Node 17 and Node 3 as they are directly connected and also connected to Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Formed a triangle with Node 6 and Node 10 as they are directly connected and also connected to Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> Formed a triangle with Node 6 and Node 12 as they are directly connected and also connected to Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (17, 29) -> Formed a triangle with Node 17 and Node 29 as they are directly connected and also connected to Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) -> Already counted in the triangle involving Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 24) -> Formed a triangle with Node 7 and Node 24 as they are directly connected and also connected to Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 21) -> Formed a triangle with Node 10 and Node 21 as they are directly connected and also connected to Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 27, or 28 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> Already counted in the triangle involving Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 5 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, or 25 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (20, 1) -> Formed a triangle with Node 20 and Node 1 as they are directly connected and also connected to Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 13 to 16:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 13 or 16.

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, or 27 as they are smaller than 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (21, 23) -> Formed a triangle with Node 21 and Node 23 as they are directly connected and also connected to Node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19 to Node 29:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 19 or 29.

Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
