Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2)

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 9, 6>.
    * Pair 6: (9, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 9, 1>.
    * Pair 7 (9, 7) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 9, 1>.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <6, 7, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
