Response:
Following the step-by-step process of counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

[<3, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 4>]
