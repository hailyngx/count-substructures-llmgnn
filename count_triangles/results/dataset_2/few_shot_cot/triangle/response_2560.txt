Response:
Following the described step-by-step process for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 11 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (16, 19) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 17 and 19 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Both 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 11 are directly connected as (5, 11) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 13 are directly connected as (8, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 15) -> Both 8 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 15) -> Both 13 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> Both 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> Both 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 11 and 14 are directly connected as (11, 14) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> Both 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> Both 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Both 11 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 and 5 as they are smaller than 8
    * No other nodes left to form triangles

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 4 as they are smaller than 9
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> Both 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 19: Not enough nodes to form triangles with at least two nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
