Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

Node 0:
* Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
* Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 1:
* Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
* Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 2:
* Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
* Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 3:
* Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
* Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 4:
* Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
* Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 5:
* Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected.
* Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 6:
* Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected.
* Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 7:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
* Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 8:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
* Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 9:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
* Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph [3] - There are three triangles in the given graph: <0, 2, 5>, <1, 6, 8>, and <3, 4, 8>.
