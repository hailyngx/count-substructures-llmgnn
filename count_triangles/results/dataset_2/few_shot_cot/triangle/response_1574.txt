Response:
Following the process outlined in the example for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 28) -> 1 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 28) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 17) -> 1 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (19, 17) -> 19 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 28) -> 5 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 28) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 28) -> 6 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 28) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> Both 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 15) -> 16 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (16, 15) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (19, 15) -> 19 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (25, 4) -> 25 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (25, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (25, 12) -> 25 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (3, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue the process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, and all other nodes until you have counted all triangles. Finally, sum up the total triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node.

Then, provide the final answer inside brackets [] following the format demonstrated in the initial example.
