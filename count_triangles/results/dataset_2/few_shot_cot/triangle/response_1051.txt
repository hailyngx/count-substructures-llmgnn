Response:
Following the step-by-step process as outlined in the guide with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (7, 5).  
    * Pair 4: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (15, 5) -> 15 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (15, 5).  
    * Pair 6: (18, 5) -> 18 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 16).  
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 4) -> 17 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (17, 4).  
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (11, 9).  
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (5, 7).  
    * Pair 4: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (5, 15).  
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (9, 12).  
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Since Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 do not have pairs greater than them, we skip them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8 triangles] in the given graph.
