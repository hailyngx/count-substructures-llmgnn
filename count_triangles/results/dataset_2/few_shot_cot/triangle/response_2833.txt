Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided for the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (1, 17) -> 1 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 2 are also connected as shown in the adjacency list.
        * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

    Continue this process for Nodes 6 to 19 to find all the triangles and then sum them up.

    Final triangles found:
