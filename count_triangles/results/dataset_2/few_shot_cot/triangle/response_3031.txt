Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 9, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's calculate the total number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed <1, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed <3, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
