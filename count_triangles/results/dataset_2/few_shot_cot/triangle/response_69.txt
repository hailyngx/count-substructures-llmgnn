Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, no edge between 1 and 19. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, no edge between 9 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. But there are no third neighbors connected to both 7 and 8. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip, as all the neighboring nodes are smaller than 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip, as all the neighboring nodes are smaller than 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 19, and they are connected. But there are no third neighbors connected to both 0 and 14. No triangle formed.
