Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (10, 0) and (0, 19). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 18), (18, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (13, 0) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (16, 10) -> 16 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (16, 10) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

Proceeding similarly with the remaining nodes:
* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 1 triangle
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 1 triangle
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 1 triangle
* Node 19: 0 triangles

Summing up the triangles formed at each node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
