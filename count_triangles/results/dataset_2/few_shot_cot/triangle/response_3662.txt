Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Edge (5, 7) exists, and 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed. <0, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Edge (5, 7) exists, and 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed. <1, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> There is an edge between 6 and 14. However, 6 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Edge (9, 12) exists, and 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed. <3, 9, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Edge (6, 9) exists, and 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed. <4, 6, 9>
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> Edge (9, 12) exists, and 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed. <4, 9, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Edge (0, 7) exists, and 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5. Triangle formed. <0, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Edge (1, 5) exists, and 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5. Triangle formed. <1, 5, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Edge (4, 9) exists, and 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed. <4, 6, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Edge (8, 14) exists, and 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 10. Triangle formed. <10, 8, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (13, 9) -> Edge (13, 9) exists, and 13 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 14. Triangle formed. <14, 13, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
