Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are directly connected as (9, 18) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other from node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * <0, 9, 11> and <0, 9, 18>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are directly connected as (7, 19) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * <1, 7, 19>

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * <2, 5, 12>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 4, and they are directly connected as (14, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * <4, 6, 14>

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 5, and they are directly connected as (2, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * <2, 5, 12>

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 7, and they are directly connected as (17, 18) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * <7, 17, 18>

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs of nodes greater than them to form triangles.
  
Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph: [2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8 to Node 19)] = 6
* Unique triangles: [ <0, 9, 11>, <0, 9, 18>, <1, 7, 19>, <2, 5, 12>, <4, 6, 14>, <7, 17, 18> ]

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
