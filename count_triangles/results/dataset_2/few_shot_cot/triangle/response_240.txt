Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0)

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Not connected as (4, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Not connected as (4, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 2 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Not connected as (4, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 3) -> Not connected as (4, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 6) -> Not connected as (7, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 2) -> Both 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 2 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> Not connected as (7, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 3) -> Not connected as (7, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 2) -> Both 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 2 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (6, 3) -> Not connected as (6, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (2, 8) -> Not connected as (2, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Not connected as (4, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Not connected as (4, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 3) -> Not connected as (4, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 6) -> Both 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 2) -> Not connected as (7, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> Not connected as (7, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 3) -> Not connected as (7, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 2) -> Both 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 2 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (6, 8) -> Not connected as (6, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (6, 3) -> Not connected as (6, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (2, 8) -> Not connected as (2, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Now, continue this process for Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Once done, count the total number of triangles in the graph and present the unique triangles found inside <> each only once in the answer.
