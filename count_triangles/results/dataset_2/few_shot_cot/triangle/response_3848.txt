Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the graph provided, we can determine the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 21) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 and Node 21.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 24) -> Triangle formed with Node 17 and Node 24.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (23, 21) -> Triangle formed with Node 23 and Node 21.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 1: (12, 27) -> Triangle formed with Node 12 and Node 27.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 9.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (15, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 15 and Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (22, 29) - Triangle formed with Node 22 and Node 29.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 16.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 17.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 18.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 19.

* Node 20:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 20 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 20.

* Node 21:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 21 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 21.

* Node 22:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 22 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 22.

* Node 23:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 23 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 23.

* Node 24:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 24 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 24.

* Node 25:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 25 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 25.

    * No triangles can be formed with Node 28 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 28.

* Node 29:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 29 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors greater than 29.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
