Response:
Following the step-by-step process, here are the counts of triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11 and Node 0: <0, 7, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 16) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 18: <3, 6, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one connection.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12: <6, 10, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one connection.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 and onward:
    * No triangles can be formed with less than 2 higher numbered connections.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
