Following the step-by-step process outlined previously, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not connected as there is no edge (7, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are connected as (5, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are connected as (9, 14) in the edge list.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are connected as (13, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are listed below:
[<0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 12, 13>, <4, 5, 14>, <6, 9, 14>, <7, 12, 13>]
