Response:
Let's go step by step through each node to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 5: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 4.

    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = [5].

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
