Response:
Following the method described in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip nodes smaller than Node 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> Both 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * Triangles cannot be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip nodes smaller than Node 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * Since there aren't at least two nodes greater than each of these nodes, no triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
