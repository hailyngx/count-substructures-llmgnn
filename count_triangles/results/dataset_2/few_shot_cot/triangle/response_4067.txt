Response:
Following the same process as in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 2 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed because the potential pairs do not have a common neighbor.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed because there are not enough nodes connected to Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed because the potential pairs do not have a common neighbor.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed because there are not enough nodes connected to Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
