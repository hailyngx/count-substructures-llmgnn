Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 -> <0, 2, 9>
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> No triangle as Node 1 is not connected to Node 2 or any other node in the pair.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 -> <0, 2, 9>
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> No triangle as Node 1 is not connected to Node 7 or any other node in the pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 -> <0, 1, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as Node 3 and Node 8 are not connected via an edge.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as Node 5 and Node 9 are not connected via an edge.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed as Node 5 and Node 4 are not connected via an edge.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as Node 5 and Node 7 are not connected via an edge.
    * Pair 4: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed as Node 5 and Node 1 are not connected via an edge.
    * Pair 5: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed as Node 5 and Node 2 are not connected via an edge.
    * Pair 6: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed as Node 9 and Node 4 are not connected via an edge.
    * Pair 7: (9, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 -> <0, 3, 9>
    * Pair 8: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed as Node 9 and Node 1 are not connected via an edge.
    * Pair 9: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed as Node 9 and Node 2 are not connected via an edge.
    * Pair 10: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 -> <3, 4, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 and sum up the total triangles found:

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
