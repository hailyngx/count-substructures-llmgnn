Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [9].
