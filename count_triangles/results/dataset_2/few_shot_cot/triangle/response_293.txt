Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are connected. Check the third node: 16 is connected to 1, forming a triangle <0, 12, 16>.
    * Pair 3: (12, 11) -> 12 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are connected. Check the third node: 1 is connected to 4, forming a triangle <0, 12, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected. Check the third node: 8 is connected to 1, forming a triangle <1, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are connected. Check the third node: 14 is connected to 6, forming a triangle <3, 9, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. Check the third node: 8 is connected to 1, forming a triangle <4, 7, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are connected. Check the third node: 10 is connected to 3, forming a triangle <4, 7, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are connected. Check the third node: 16 is connected to 1, forming a triangle <6, 14, 16>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are connected. Check the third node: 19 is connected to 9, forming a triangle <7, 12, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are connected. Check the third node: 19 is connected to 7, forming a triangle <3, 9, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * Node 17 is not connected to any other nodes.

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
