Response:
Following the process described in the initial example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
