Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 22) -> 9 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 20) -> 9 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (22, 20) -> 22 and 20 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (22, 17) -> 22 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (20, 17) -> 20 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (20, 17) in the edge list. Triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 1.

Therefore, there is **1 triangle** in the given graph.  
The unique triangle found is:  
[<17, 20, 0>]
