    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs with smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pairs with smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pairs with smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Pairs with smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
