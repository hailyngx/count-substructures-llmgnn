Response:
Following the same method as described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (8, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (7, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (0, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (9, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (9, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (0, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
