Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other since (10, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (18, 1) -> 18 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (16, 8) -> 16 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as (16, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as (14, 19) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (15, 4) -> 15 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest node since all its neighbors are of smaller value.

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest node since all its neighbors are of smaller value.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest node since all its neighbors are of smaller value.

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (17, 16) -> 17 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as (17, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest node since all its neighbors are of smaller value.

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest node since all its neighbors are of smaller value.

* Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest node since all its neighbors are of smaller value.

* Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest node since all its neighbors are of smaller value.

* Node 15:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest node since all its neighbors are of smaller value.

* Node 16:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest node since all its neighbors are of smaller value.

* Node 17:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest node since all its neighbors are of smaller value.

* Node 18:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest node since all its neighbors are of smaller value.

* Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest node since all its neighbors are of smaller value.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the number of triangles in the graph is [7].
