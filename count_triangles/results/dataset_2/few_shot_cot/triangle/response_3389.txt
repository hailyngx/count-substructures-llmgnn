Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (10, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (9, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (7, 10). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (1, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (9, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

I will continue this process for the remaining nodes to find all the triangles in the graph. Let's continue with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
