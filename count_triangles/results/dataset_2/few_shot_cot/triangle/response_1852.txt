Response:
Following the same process as described in the example for the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - <9, 10, 0>: 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 10 are directly connected as (9, 10) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1**:
    - <8, 9, 1>: 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Skip additional combinations involving Node 1 since other nodes with smaller numbers have already been considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2 to Node 8**:
    - Since there are no triangles formed exclusively between nodes 2 to 8, we can skip analyzing these nodes.

9. **Node 9**:
    - Skip 1-hop neighbor combinations that have nodes smaller than 9.
    - <1, 18, 9>: 1 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (1, 18) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. **Node 10**:
    - <0, 18, 10>: 0 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected as (0, 18) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. **Node 11 to Node 20**:
    - There are no new triangles between nodes 11 to 20.

21. **Node 21**:
    - Skip 1-hop neighbor combinations that have nodes smaller than 21.
    - Since there are no triangles exclusively between nodes 22 to 30, we can skip analyzing these nodes.

27. **Node 27**:
    - Skip exploring nodes smaller than 27 as they have already been considered.

28. **Node 28**:
    - <9, 24, 28>: 9 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 28, and they are directly connected as (9, 24) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Finally, summing up the total number of triangles found for each node:
\[1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 28)\] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is \[5\].
