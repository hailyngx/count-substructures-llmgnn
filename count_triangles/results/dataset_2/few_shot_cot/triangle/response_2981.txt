Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
