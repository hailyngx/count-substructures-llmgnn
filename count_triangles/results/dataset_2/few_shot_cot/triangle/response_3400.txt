Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, and node 2

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped all pairs since there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipped all pairs since there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipped since there are no nodes greater than 6 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipped since there are no nodes greater than 7 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipped since there are no nodes greater than 8 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped since there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
