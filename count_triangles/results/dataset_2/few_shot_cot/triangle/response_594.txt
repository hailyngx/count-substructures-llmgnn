Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) - 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 0) - 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) - 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 2) - 11 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 0) - 11 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 14) - 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 9) - 11 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 2) - 12 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (12, 0) - 12 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (12, 14) - 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (12, 9) - 12 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (2, 0) - 2 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (2, 14) - 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (2, 9) - 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (0, 14) - 0 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (0, 9) - 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (14, 9) - 14 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

This process will continue for the rest of the nodes to calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.
