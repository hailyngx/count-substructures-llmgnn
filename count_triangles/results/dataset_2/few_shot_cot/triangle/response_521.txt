Response:
Following the same procedure as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are connected.
    * Pair 6: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for all nodes in the graph, the total count of triangles is [4].
