Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 14 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 15 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 27) -> 10 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 10 and 27 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 14 and 18 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 24) -> 14 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 14 and 24 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pair to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 15 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 27) -> 5 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 27 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 17 and 19 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: No triangle can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (19, 28) -> 19 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 17, and 19 and 28 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are: <1, 14, 24>, <2, 4, 5>, <9, 15, 4>, <10, 27, 1>, <11, 14, 18>, <15, 0, 2>, <17, 19, 28>, <19, 28, 17>, <22, 1, 14>.
The final answer is [9].
