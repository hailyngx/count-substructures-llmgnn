Response:
Following the same steps as in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are connected in the graph. No other nodes left to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected in the graph. No other nodes left to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected in the graph. No other nodes left to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected in the graph, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected in the graph, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
