Response:
Applying the triangle counting method to each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are not connected because (1, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 14 are also connected as (4, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 1 are also connected as (4, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 6 are connected as (9, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 14 are also connected as (9, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 1 are connected as (9, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 5 and 6:
    * Continue this process for Nodes 5 and 6.

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skip these nodes as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 4)
= 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
