Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle found with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangle found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 8, 9, and 10:
    * Skipped as there are no 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * No triangle found with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 as they are smaller than 13.
    * No triangle found with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * No triangle found with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles: 
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 12) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
