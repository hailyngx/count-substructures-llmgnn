Response:
Following the step-by-step process as mentioned in the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Can form a triangle with node 12.
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> Can form a triangle with node 10.
    * Pair 3: (8, 18) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 10) -> Can form a triangle with node 10.
    * Pair 5: (12, 18) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 18) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> Can form a triangle with node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0 and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 11) -> Can form a triangle with node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (17, 11) -> Can form a triangle with node 11.
    * Pair 2: (17, 19) -> Can form a triangle with node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8, 9, 10:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8, 9, or 10.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0-12. 
    * Total triangles with 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0-13.
    * Pair 1: (17, 11) -> Both 17 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0-14.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0-15.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0-16.
    * Pair 1: (17, 11) -> Both 17 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 17, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0-17.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0-18.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8-10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.

[<8, 10, 12>, <15, 19, 1>, <8, 12, 10>, <12, 11, 4>, <17, 11, 7>, <17, 19, 7>, <17, 11, 14>, <17, 11, 7>]
