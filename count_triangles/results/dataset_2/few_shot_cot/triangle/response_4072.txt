Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:
    
    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (5, 28) -> 5 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 4: (5, 26) -> 5 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (19, 28) -> 19 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (19, 6) -> 19 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (19, 26) -> 19 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 8: (28, 6) -> 28 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 9: (28, 26) -> 28 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 10: (6, 26) -> 6 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3  [ <5, 19, 28>, <5, 6, 19>, <19, 26, 0> ]

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (21, 29) -> 21 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (11, 25) -> 11 and 25 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (11, 26) -> 11 and 26 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes as endpoints.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes as endpoints.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (9, 22) -> 9 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes as endpoints.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (21, 5) -> 21 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Skipping Nodes 10 to 29 as no triangles can be formed with at least two nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0)
    
Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
