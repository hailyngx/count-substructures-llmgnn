Response:
Following the procedure described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 4) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 11: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are both connected to node 0 but not directly to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 13: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pairs involving 0 are skipped as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2, 3, and 4:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 5) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
