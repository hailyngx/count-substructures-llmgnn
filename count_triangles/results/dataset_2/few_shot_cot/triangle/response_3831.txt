Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, we can determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 5. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or connected to node 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 9.

Therefore, the answer is [9].
