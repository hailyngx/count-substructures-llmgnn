Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now continue the process for Nodes 6 to 19, then sum up the total number of triangles found in the entire graph.

After calculating the triangles with Node 6 to 19, the final answer is: [5].
