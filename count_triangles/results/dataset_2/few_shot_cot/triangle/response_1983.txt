Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> Both 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 6) -> Both 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> Both 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> Both 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (9, 3) -> Both 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Both 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> Both 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> Both 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Now, continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, and then sum up the total triangles found for each node.

Finally, share the total number of triangles in the graph inside brackets as requested.
