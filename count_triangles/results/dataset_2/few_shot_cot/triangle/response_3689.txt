Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (7, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:

    * Pair 2: (12, 11) -> 12 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
