Response:
Following the approach described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

```
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 3) -> 13 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) = 19.
```

Therefore, there are [19] triangles in the given graph.
