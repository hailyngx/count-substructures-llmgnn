Response:
This is an example of how you can count the triangles in a graph step-by-step applied to each node in the graph: 
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 5: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as there are not at least two nodes greater than 2.

Follow the same process for Nodes 3 to 19, and finally count the total number of triangles in the graph.
