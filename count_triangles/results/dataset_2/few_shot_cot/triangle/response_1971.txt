Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (16, 19) -> 16 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, 19 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, but 16 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 17 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 23) -> 1 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 1 and 23 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7:
    * Skipped because there are no suitable pairs to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 24) -> 2 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 2 and 24 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9, 10, 11:
    * Skipped because there are no suitable pairs to form triangles.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 23) -> 14 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 13, 14, 15:
    * Skipped because there are no suitable pairs to form triangles.

* Nodes 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped because there are no suitable pairs to form triangles.

* Node 20:
    * Pair 1: (7, 27) -> 7 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 20, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 21, 22, 23:
    * Skipped because there are no suitable pairs to form triangles.

* Node 24:
    * Pair 1: (8, 27) -> 8 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 24, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 25, 26, 27:
    * Skipped because there are no suitable pairs to form triangles.

* Nodes 28, 29:
    * Skipped because there are no suitable pairs to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
