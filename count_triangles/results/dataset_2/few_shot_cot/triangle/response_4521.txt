Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
