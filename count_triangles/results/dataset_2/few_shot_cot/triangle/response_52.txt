Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- For Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- For Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    - Pair 2: (10, 7) -> 10 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- For Node 2:
    - Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes, hence no triangles can be formed.

- For Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    - Pair 4: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    - Pair 5: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- For Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    - Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- For Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    - After checking all possible pairs for each node, there are no triangles that can be formed.

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles by summing the triangles found for each node:
Total triangles = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 6

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
