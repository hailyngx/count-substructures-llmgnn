Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's possible triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forming a triangle with Node 4 and Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (4, 18) -> Not connected in a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> Not connected in a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (7, 18) -> Forming a triangle with Node 7 and Node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2 
    * Unique triangles: <2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 18>

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> Not connected in a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> Not connected in a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> Forming a triangle with Node 7 and Node 14.
    * Pair 4: (16, 19) -> Not connected in a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (16, 14) -> Not connected in a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (19, 14) -> Not connected in a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 
    * Unique triangles: <4, 7, 14>

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (19, 17) -> Forming a triangle with Node 17 and Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <17, 19, 4>

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 17) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
