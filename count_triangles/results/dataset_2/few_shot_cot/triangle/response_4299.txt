Response:
Following the same method as the given example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Not a triangle because nodes 1 and 3 are not directly connected.
  * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Not a triangle because nodes 1 and 8 are not directly connected.
  * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Not a triangle because nodes 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> Not a triangle because nodes 3 and 14 are not directly connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
