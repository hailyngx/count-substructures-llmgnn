Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (11, 15) - 11 and 15 are not connected because (11, 15) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (0, 11) - 0 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (0, 18) - 0 and 18 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (1, 10) - 1 and 10 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (13, 17) - 13 and 17 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Skip any other pairs involving Node 2 or smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (3, 18) - 3 and 18 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 11) - 3 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (4, 11) - 4 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 16) - 4 and 16 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (4, 14) - 4 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 19) - 5 and 19 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (6, 12) - 6 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (6, 17) - 6 and 17 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (7, 19) - 7 and 19 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (7, 14) - 7 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Pair 1: (8, 12) - 8 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Skip any other pairs involving Node 8 or smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Pair 1: (9, 13) - 9 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (9, 12) - 9 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 10:
            * Pair 1: (10, 14) - 10 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Skip any other pairs involving Node 10 or smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.

        Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
