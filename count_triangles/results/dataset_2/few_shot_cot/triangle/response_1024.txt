Response:
Applying the same method as shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
* Node 1:
    * Pairs involving Node 0 are already considered.
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 are already considered.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 are already considered.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, 5, and 6:
    * Nodes 0 and 1 are larger, continue to the next nodes.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pairs involving Node 1 and 7 are already considered.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (1, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.

If you need, I can provide the unique triangles found as well.
