Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's find the total number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Pair 4: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Pair 5: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Pair 4: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Pair 5: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
