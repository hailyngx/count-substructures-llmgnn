Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example with updated information for the provided graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected because (2, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
        * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles with.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
