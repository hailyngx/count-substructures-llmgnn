Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the same steps as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4. Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6. Triangle: <0, 1, 6>
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8. Triangle: <0, 1, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9. Triangle: <1, 3, 9>
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4. Triangle: <1, 3, 4>
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0. Triangle: <1, 3, 0>
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8. Triangle: <1, 3, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8. Triangle: <2, 6, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9. Triangle: <3, 4, 9>
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6. Triangle: <3, 4, 6>
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0. Triangle: <3, 4, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles possible.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 0>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 0>]
