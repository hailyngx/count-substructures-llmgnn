Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 4 are also connected as (5, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 0 are also connected as (0, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 4 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 4 are also connected as (5, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 7 are also connected as (9, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 8 are also connected as (9, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 0), but since 7 and 0 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 0 are also connected as (0, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [8].
