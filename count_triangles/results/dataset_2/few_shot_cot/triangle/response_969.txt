Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are connected as (3, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> Both 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 8 are connected as (0, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle formation as all nodes connected to node 5 are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 8 are connected as (9, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle formation as all nodes connected to node 8 are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle formation as all nodes connected to node 9 are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
