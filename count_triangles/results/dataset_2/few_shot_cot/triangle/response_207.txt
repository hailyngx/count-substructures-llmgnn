Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 14 are also connected as (5, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 14 are also connected as (8, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 13 are also connected as (3, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 13 are also connected as (4, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 14 are also connected as (5, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 14 are also connected as (7, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 12 are also connected as (6, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 13 are also connected as (6, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 13 are also connected as (1, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 11 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 will give us the total number of triangles.
