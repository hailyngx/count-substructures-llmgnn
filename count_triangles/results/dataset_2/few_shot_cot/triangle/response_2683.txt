Response:
Following the step-by-step method described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1**:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2**:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3**:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4**:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5**:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6**:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7**:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8**:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9**:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up all the triangles from each node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
The final answer is [0].
