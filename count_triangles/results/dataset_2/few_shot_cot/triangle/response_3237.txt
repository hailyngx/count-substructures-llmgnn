Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) - 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) - 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) - 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (6, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) - 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 12) - 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (11, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (11, 1) - 11 and 1 are not connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (11, 2) - 11 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (12, 1) - 12 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (12, 2) - 12 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) - 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) - 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (8, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) - 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) - 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 13) - 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (5, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (13, 14) - 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) - 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) - 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) - 9 and 3 are connected, but 9 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 7) - 12 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (12, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (12, 13) - 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 3) - 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node. No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (10, 5) - Both 10 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) - Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 13) - Both 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) - Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (13, 11) - Both 13 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process node by node:

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [8].
