Response:
Following the same steps as the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> <0, 9, 5>
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> <0, 9, 11>
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> <1, 6, 9>
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> <1, 6, 11>
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> <1, 6, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> <3, 5, 14>
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> <3, 5, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> <4, 8, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> <7, 9, 8>
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> <8, 9, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (11, 1) -> <9, 11, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 12, 13, or 14 respectively.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) = 11.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
