Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with them.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with them.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with them.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
