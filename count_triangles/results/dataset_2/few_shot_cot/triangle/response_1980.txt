Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> forms a triangle with Node 22
    * Pair 2: (1, 22) -> forms a triangle with Node 15
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> forms a triangle with Node 12
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0 is smaller)
    * Pair 1: (5, 22) -> forms a triangle with Node 15
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 23) -> forms a triangle with Node 13
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0 is smaller)
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [6].
