Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same approach as the example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 6, 7>.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) - Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 2) - Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <1, 2, 0>.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) - Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <2, 5, 0>.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) - Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <2, 8, 3>.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <3, 7, 0>.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <4, 8, 3>.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <7, 8, 3>.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
