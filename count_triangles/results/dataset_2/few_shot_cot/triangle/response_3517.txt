Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

Here are the triangles formed by each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 and 6 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not directly connected because (6, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 12 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue the process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipped because all pairs with smaller nodes have been considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 17:
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 2 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
