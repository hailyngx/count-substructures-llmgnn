Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 28) -> 0 and 28 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other valid pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No valid pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other valid pairs to consider.

    * Pair 1: (7, 24) -> 7 and 24 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other valid pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 26) -> 8 and 26 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 27) -> 8 and 27 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.

    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 28) -> 9 and 28 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other valid pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other valid pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* For Nodes 11 to 30, there are no valid pairs to consider for each node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 16.

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.
