Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will now compute the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 0) and (0, 12) are in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 25) -> 1 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 28) -> 1 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 0) and (0, 12) are in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 25) -> 2 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 28) -> 2 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 0) and (0, 28) are in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (12, 25) -> 12 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (12, 28) -> 12 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (12, 0) and (0, 28) are in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 1: (19, 27) -> 19 and 27 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:

    * Pair 4: (12, 29) -> 12 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 18, and they are directly connected as (0, 12) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:

    * Pair 1: (27, 20) -> 27 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 19, and they are directly connected as (27, 19) and (19, 20) are in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * No triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 8

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
