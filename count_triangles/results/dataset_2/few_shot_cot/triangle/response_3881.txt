Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 11 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 10 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 11 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 10 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continue this process for Nodes 6 to 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
[3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 3 (Node 11) + 2 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) = 25]

Therefore, there are 25 triangles in the given graph.
