Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0

Response:
Following the provided example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9: <0, 1, 4>
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <0, 1, 9>
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <0, 4, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8: <1, 3, 7>
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <1, 3, 9>
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <1, 7, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <2, 3, 6>
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <2, 3, 9>
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <2, 4, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <3, 4, 6>
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <3, 6, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <4, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No triangle can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    No triangle can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    No triangle can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    No triangle can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 1, 9>
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <1, 2, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are [14] triangles in the given graph.
