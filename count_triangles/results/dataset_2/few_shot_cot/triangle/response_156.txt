Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
