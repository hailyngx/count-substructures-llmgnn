Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's connections:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 1 are connected as (4, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 12 are connected as (9, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 4 are connected as (5, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 1 are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * Repeat the same process as done for Nodes 0 and 1 by skipping pairs that include smaller numbered nodes.
    * Count the total triangles for each node.

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes and count the total triangles for each node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = Sum of triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node.

Calculate the total number of triangles by adding the triangles found for each node. Provide the answer in brackets [].
