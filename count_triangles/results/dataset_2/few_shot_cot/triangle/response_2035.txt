Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5 through 14: Based on the given adjacency lists, there are no possible triangles to form with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5-14) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
