Response:
Following the initial example provided, we will now count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 17 and 8 are also connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 11 are also connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are also connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 8 and 12 are also connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 12 and 10 are also connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 2 and 8 are also connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 15 are also connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 17 are also connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
