Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed as nodes 8 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> No triangle formed as nodes 8 and 11 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 11) -> This forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

3. Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

4. Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

5. Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

6. Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

7. Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed as nodes 8 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed as nodes 6 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 6.

8. Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

9. Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

10. Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

11. Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

12. Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

13. Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

14. Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

15. Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

16. Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15.

17. Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes due to the absence of at least 2 nodes greater than these in the graph.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
