Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Not connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Not connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 4: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing the process with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [5].
