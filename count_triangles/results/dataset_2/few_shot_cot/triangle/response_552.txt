Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Following the same process as the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (1, 2, 3). No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (9). No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 3). No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (5). No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (0, 1, 2, 3). No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (5). No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
