Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above to count the triangles for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> Both 14 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (14, 11) -> Both 14 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (16, 11) -> Both 16 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 16 and 11 are not directly connected as there is no edge (16, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 10 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 10 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (10, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 13 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (10, 6) -> Both 10 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 10 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (10, 19) -> Both 10 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 10 and 19 are not directly connected as there is no edge (10, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 19) -> Both 6 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (13, 12) -> Both 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 13 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Nodes 5 to 19:
            * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 neighbors greater than their own index to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5 to 19) = 7.

        Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

        The unique triangles found are:
        <14, 0, 11>
        <10, 1, 13>
        <10, 2, 6>
        <10, 6, 19>
        <13, 1, 6>
        <13, 12, 4>
        <13, 9, 16>

        So, the final answer is [7].
