Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: <3, 24, 0> - Nodes 3, 24, and 0 are all 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: <3, 20, 2> - Nodes 3, 20, and 2 are all 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: <4, 11, 8> - Nodes 4, 11, and 8 are all 1-hop neighbors of Node 11, but they are not directly connected to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: <0, 13, 26> - Nodes 0, 13, and 26 are all 1-hop neighbors of Node 13, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 19.

* Node 20:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 20.

    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 22.

* Node 23:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 23.

* Node 24:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 24.

* Node 25:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 25.

* Node 26:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 26.

* Node 27:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 27.

* Node 28:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 28.

* Node 29:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 29.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 2.

Therefore, there are a total of 2 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [2].
