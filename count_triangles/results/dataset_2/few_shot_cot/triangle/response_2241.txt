Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
	* Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Connected to Node 1 and Node 4, which are directly connected. Triangle <0, 1, 4> formed.
	* Pair 2: (1, 24) -> Connected to Node 1 and Node 24, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
	* Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
	* Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1, as they were covered in the examination of Node 0.
	* No other pairs left to form triangles.
	* Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
	* Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2, as they were already covered.
	* No pairs left to form triangles.
	* Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
	* Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
	* No pairs left to form triangles.
	* Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
	* Pair 1: (16, 27) -> Connected to Node 16 and Node 27, which are directly connected. Triangle <4, 16, 27> formed.
	* No other pairs left to form triangles.
	* Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
	* Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
	* No pairs left to form triangles.
	* Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
	* Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
	* No pairs left to form triangles.
	* Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
	* Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
	* No pairs left to form triangles.
	* Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
	* As Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes, no triangles can be formed with it.
	* Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
	* Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
	* No pairs left to form triangles.
	* Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
	* Pair 1: (0, 17) -> Connected to Node 0 and Node 17, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
	* No other pairs left to form triangles.
	* Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continue this process for the remaining nodes to find all the triangles in the graph.
