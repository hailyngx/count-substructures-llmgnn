Response:
Following the same methodology as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14. <0, 3, 9>
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 18. <0, 3, 14>
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 18. <0, 9, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 16) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15. <2, 3, 16>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15. <3, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9. <3, 4, 15>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16. <5, 7, 17>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12. <7, 16, 17>
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 17) with Node 8, but since 7 and 17 are both smaller than 8, this pair is skipped.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 17.

* Node 18 and Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Nodes 10-19) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
