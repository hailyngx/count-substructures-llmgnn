Summarizing the triangles found:

Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 3 (Node 11) + 3 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [20].
