Response:
Following the method outlined before, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - No connection between 2 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - No connection between 3 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - No connection between 4 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) - 8 and 7 are connected as shown in the provided edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are connected as shown in the provided edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the provided edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the provided edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No connection between 5 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are connected as shown in the provided edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node. No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are |5| triangles in the given graph.
