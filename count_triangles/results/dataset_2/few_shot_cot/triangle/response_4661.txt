Response:
Following the step-by-step process as demonstrated in the example:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 1.
            * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 2.
            * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are not connected even though they are both 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 3.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 4:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
            * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 11, 12>.
            * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 5.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 6.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 7:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 7.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 8:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 8.
            * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 8, 14>.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 9:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 9.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Continue the process similarly for Nodes 10 to 19.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2

        Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
