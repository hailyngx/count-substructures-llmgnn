Response:
Following the step-by-step process described:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> Both 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (11, 9) -> Both 11 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Both 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> Both 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (11, 14) -> Both 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Both 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Both 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> Both 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> Both 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (3, 14) -> Both 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Both 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
            * No triangles can be formed as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

        Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
