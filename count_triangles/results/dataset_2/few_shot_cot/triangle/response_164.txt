    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 1, 9>, <2, 3, 13>, <4, 7, 13>, <4, 8, 7>, <6, 12, 14>, <7, 11, 13>, <11, 12, 14>, <5, 9, 12>.

So, the answer is [8].
