Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's go ahead and count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 1) - 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) - 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No further triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (9, 3). 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) - 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (7, 14).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, Node 5, Node 6:
    * Skipping these nodes for now as they are smaller than Node 7.

* Node 7:
    * No further triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No further triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 and they are directly connected as (6, 10). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 and they are directly connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 10. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * Skipping these nodes as they are smaller than Node 10.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [4].
