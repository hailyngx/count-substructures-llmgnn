Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

There are no more nodes larger than 4, so we conclude the calculations here.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
