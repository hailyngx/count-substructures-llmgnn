Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (0, 2) -> Node 0 and Node 2 are connected, but Node 0 and Node 2 do not form triangles with any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Formed a triangle with Node 6 (9-1-6).
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Formed a triangle with Node 4 (6-1-4).
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> Formed a triangle with Node 4 (3-1-4).
    * Pair 4: (1, 4) -> Formed a triangle with Node 6 (1-4-6).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Formed a triangle with Node 8 (5-2-8).
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Formed a triangle with Node 5 (2-8-5).
    * Pair 3: (2, 0) -> Node 0 and Node 2 are connected, but Node 0 and Node 2 do not form triangles with any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Formed a triangle with Node 4 (3-5-4).
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Formed a triangle with Node 6 (9-3-6).
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> Formed a triangle with Node 4 (6-3-4).
    * Pair 4: (3, 1) -> Formed a triangle with Node 4 (1-3-4).
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> Formed a triangle with Node 1 (3-4-1).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Formed a triangle with Node 3 (4-5-3).
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Formed a triangle with Node 1 (4-6-1).
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Formed a triangle with Node 5 (8-4-5).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9 respectively.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 5 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [14].
