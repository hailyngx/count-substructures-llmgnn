Response:
Following the steps from the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Node 2 is directly connected to both nodes 5 and 2 forming a triangle. Triangle formed <0, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> Node 0 is directly connected to both nodes 5 and 0 forming a triangle. Triangle formed <0, 5, 0>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Node 1 is directly connected to both nodes 5 and 7 forming a triangle. Triangle formed <1, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Node 1 is directly connected to both nodes 5 and 6 forming a triangle. Triangle formed <1, 5, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Node 2 is directly connected to both nodes 5 and 9 forming a triangle. Triangle formed <2, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Node 2 is directly connected to both nodes 5 and 7 forming a triangle. Triangle formed <2, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) -> Node 2 is directly connected to both nodes 5 and 0 forming a triangle. Triangle formed <0, 2, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Node 3 is directly connected to both nodes 4 and 7 forming a triangle. Triangle formed <3, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
