Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 1) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 2) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 3) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (5, 2) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (1, 2) - Node 1 and Node 2 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (1, 8) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (1, 2) - Node 1 and Node 2 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (1, 0) - Node 1 and Node 0 are 1-hop neighbors but not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 10: (2, 8) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 2) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 0) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 2) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (6, 3) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (2, 0) - Node 2 and Node 0 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (9, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (6, 1) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (6, 4) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5: 
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, summing up all the triangles for each node:
2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 2>
