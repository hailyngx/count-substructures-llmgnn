Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 3 are directly connected as (4, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> Both 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 3 are directly connected as (6, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 2 are directly connected as (4, 2) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> Both 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 2 are directly connected as (6, 2) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> Both 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> Both 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 8 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more possible triangles for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 5 to form a triangle.

Now, let's summarize the triangles and find the total number of triangles in the graph:

    Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
