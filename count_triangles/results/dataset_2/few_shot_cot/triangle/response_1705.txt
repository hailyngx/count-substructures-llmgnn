Response:
Following the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

- Node 0:
    1. (2, 3) and (2, 11) are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected (2, 3) and (2, 11) edges exist. Triangle formed.
    2. (2, 7) and (2, 3) are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected (2, 7) edge doesn't exist. No triangle formed.
    3. (2, 11) and (2, 4) are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected (2, 4) edge doesn't exist. No triangle formed.
    4. (3, 4) and (3, 11) are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected (3, 4) and (3, 11) edges exist. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    1. (8, 11) and (8, 1) are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected (8, 11) and (8, 1) edges exist. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    1. (9, 3) and (9, 0) are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected (9, 3) and (9, 0) edges don't exist. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    1. (5, 11) and (5, 3) are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected (5, 11) and (5, 3) edges exist. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    1. (10, 11) and (10, 4) are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected (10, 11) and (10, 4) edges exist. Triangle formed.
    2. (10, 4) and (10, 13) are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected (10, 13) edge doesn't exist. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    1. (6, 10) and (6, 5) are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected (6, 10) and (6, 5) edges exist. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    1. (5, 10) and (5, 6) are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected (5, 10) and (5, 6) edges exist. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    1. (6, 7) and (6, 10) are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected (6, 7) edge doesn't exist. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    1. (9, 8) and (9, 0) are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected (9, 8) and (9, 0) edges exist. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    1. (12, 9) and (12, 4) are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected (12, 9) and (12, 4) edges exist. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    Since no triangle can be formed with these nodes, they are skipped.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
