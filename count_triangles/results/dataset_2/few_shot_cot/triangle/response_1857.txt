Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Both 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 3 are directly connected as (0, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 5 are directly connected as (0, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> Both 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 6 are directly connected as (0, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 2) -> Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 2 are directly connected as (0, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 7) -> Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 7 are directly connected as (0, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are directly connected as (1, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 6 are directly connected as (1, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are directly connected as (1, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are directly connected as (2, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there aren't at least two nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
