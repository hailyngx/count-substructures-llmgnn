Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> 0 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 16 and 17 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<16, 17, 4>)

6. Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<5, 7, 18>)

7. Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Nodes 8, 9, and 10:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

10. Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Nodes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
