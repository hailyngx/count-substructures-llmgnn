Response:
Following the example provided, we will now systematically count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 13 are not connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 13) -> 17 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 17 and 13 are not connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 11 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 8) -> 18 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 18 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:

    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * These nodes are not the smallest, so we can skip them for now.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 11
