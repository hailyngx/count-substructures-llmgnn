Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (7, 16) -> Both 7 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected (7, 0) and (16, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 17) -> Both 0 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
