Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (triangles: <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 6>)

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (triangles: <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 8>)

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (triangles: <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 6>, <4, 9, 6>)

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 and 9 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
