    * Perform calculations for Nodes 12, 13, and 14 using the same methodology.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = [Sum of triangles for each node]
* Therefore, identify all unique triangles found inside <> and provide the final count of triangles as [total count].

Please proceed with this step-by-step process for the remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles in the graph.
