Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 5, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
