Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 9) -> 10 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 16). Potential triangle: 1-10-16.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 9). Potential triangle: 1-9-10.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider as there is only one connected node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (10, 11). Potential triangle: 4-10-11.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing the process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (6, 15). Potential triangle: 6-7-15.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Skipping Nodes 10 to 19 because they are all not the smallest numbered nodes for forming triangles.

Summarizing the triangles computed:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
