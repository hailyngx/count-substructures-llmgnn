Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

- Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Continue this process for each node, and then count the total number of triangles in the graph. We will list the unique triangles found within <> as instructed:
