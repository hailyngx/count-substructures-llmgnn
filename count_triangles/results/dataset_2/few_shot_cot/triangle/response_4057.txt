Response:
Following the steps outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 10) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 10) -> Connected. Check for common neighbors.
        * Common neighbor between 17 and 10: 1
        * Triangle formed: <0, 17, 10>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Triangle formed: <0, 17, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> Connected. Check for common neighbors.
        * Common neighbor between 10 and 19: 8

    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: <0, 17, 10>, <1, 10, 19>, <0, 17, 8>. 

Thus, the final answer is [4].
