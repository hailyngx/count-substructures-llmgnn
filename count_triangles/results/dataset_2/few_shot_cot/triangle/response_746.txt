Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - <1, 3, 6>
    - <1, 2, 12>
    - No more triangles for Node 0
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - No more triangles for Node 1
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - No more triangles for Node 2
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - No more triangles for Node 3
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - No more triangles for Node 4
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - <9, 10, 14>
    - No more triangles for Node 5
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - <7, 13, 12>
    - No more triangles for Node 6
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - No more triangles for Node 7
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - No more triangles for Node 8
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - No more triangles for Node 9
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - No more triangles for Node 10
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - No more triangles for Node 11
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - No more triangles for Node 12
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - No more triangles for Node 13
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    - No more triangles for Node 14
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[<1, 3, 6>, <1, 2, 12>, <9, 10, 14>, <7, 13, 12>]

Therefore, there are 4 unique triangles in the given graph.
