Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are connected nodes, but they don't form a triangle with node 0.
    - Pair 2: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list. They both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Node 4 is only connected to node 18 and doesn't form any triangles. No further pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - The triangles involving node 5 have already been counted in the analysis for nodes 1 and 2. No further pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. No further pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (18, 13) -> 18 and 13 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (18, 14) -> 18 and 14 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16:
    - Skipped as there are no nodes greater than them to form triangles with.

* Node 17:
    - The triangles involving node 17 have already been counted while analyzing nodes 1, 2, and 8. No further pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    - Node 18 forms triangles with other nodes, but all these triangles have been accounted for in the analysis above.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    - Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
