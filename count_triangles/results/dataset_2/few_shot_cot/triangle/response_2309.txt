Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the process demonstrated in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 6, 10>
    * Pair 2: (10, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (12, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (12, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> Triangle formed: <1, 4, 8>
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 4) -> Triangle formed: <4, 6, 10>
    * Pair 2: (10, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 6, 14>
    * Pair 6: (0, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Triangle formed: <1, 4, 8>
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10 - Node 15:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 6, 10>, <1, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 14>, <4, 6, 10>, <1, 4, 8>]
