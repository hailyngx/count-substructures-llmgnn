Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - Node 2 and Node 8 are directly connected. 
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Node 4 and Node 5 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6)- No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

The list of unique triangles found is: [<0, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 5>].

So, the final answer is [2].
