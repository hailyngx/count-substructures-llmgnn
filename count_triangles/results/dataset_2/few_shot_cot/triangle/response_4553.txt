Response:
Following the step-by-step method outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are connected through Node 0, forming a triangle <0, 5, 11>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected through Node 0, forming a triangle <0, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 4: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are connected through Node 0, forming a triangle <0, 9, 11>.
    * Pair 6: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected through Node 0, forming a triangle <0, 9, 7>.
    * Pair 7: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are connected through Node 0, forming a triangle <0, 11, 7>.
    * Pair 9: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skipping all pairs that involve nodes smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are connected through Node 2, forming a triangle <2, 6, 13>.
    * Skipping all other pairs that involve nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected through Node 3, forming a triangle <3, 9, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected through Node 3, forming a triangle <3, 9, 4>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are connected through Node 3, forming a triangle <3, 4, 10>.
    * Pair 4: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Skipping all other pairs that involve nodes smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are connected through Node 4, forming a triangle <4, 10, 1>.
    * Skipping all other pairs that involve nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7:
    * Since these nodes have been previously counted in the triangles involving other nodes, we skip them.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are connected through Node 8, forming a triangle <8, 3, 14>.
    * Skipping all other pairs that involve nodes smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Skipping Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they have been previously counted.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
