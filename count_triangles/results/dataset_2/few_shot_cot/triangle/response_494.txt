Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 3 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 3 and 9.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) - No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 3 and 4.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) - No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 4 and 6.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) - No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 6 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) - No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 0 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) - No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 1 and 9.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 1 and 4.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) - No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 1 and 6.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) - No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 6 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 9 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 1, and 8 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 1, 3, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
