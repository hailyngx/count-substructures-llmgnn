Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 5). Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no direct edge connecting them. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 6). Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 7). Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but there is no direct edge connecting them. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 8). Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 5). Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but there is no direct edge connecting them. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
            * No new triangles formed.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
            * No new triangles formed.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
            * No new triangles formed.

        * Node 7:
            * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
            * No new triangles formed.

        * Node 8:
            * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
            * No new triangles formed.

        * Node 9:
            * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
            * No new triangles formed.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 7.
        
        Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.

        The unique triangles found are:
        <3, 5, 9>
        <4, 6, 1>
        <5, 7, 2>
        <4, 8, 3>
