Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        ** (10, 14) ** - Both 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        ** (10, 16) ** - Both 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        ** (14, 16) ** - Both 14 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (14, 16). Triangle formed.
        Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        ** (14, 24) ** - Both 14 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        ** (14, 27) ** - Both 14 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        ** (24, 27) ** - Both 24 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        ** (22, 6) ** - Both 22 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (22, 6). Triangle formed.
        Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        ** (6, 23) ** - Both 6 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        ** (6, 28) ** - Both 6 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        ** (23, 28) ** - Both 23 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        ** (6, 15) ** - Both 6 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        ** (6, 22) ** - Both 6 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        ** (15, 22) ** - Both 15 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    The process will continue for the remaining nodes in the same manner, and all triangles found will be summarized at the end.
