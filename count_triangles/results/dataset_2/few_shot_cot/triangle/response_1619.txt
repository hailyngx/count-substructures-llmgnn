Response:
Following the provided example, the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph is as follows:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0. They are connected as (2, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 25) -> 2 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0. They are connected as (2, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 25) -> 7 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2. They are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 24) -> 3 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2. They are connected as (3, 24) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 24) -> 7 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (20, 22) -> 20 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 4. They are connected as (20, 22) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 7. They are connected as (7, 18) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9. They are connected as (9, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13:
    * No pairs to form triangles.

The process continues for the remaining nodes in the same manner, listing the triangles found for each node. Finally, the total number of unique triangles found in the entire graph will be counted and presented inside brackets [].
