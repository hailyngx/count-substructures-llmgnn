Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
