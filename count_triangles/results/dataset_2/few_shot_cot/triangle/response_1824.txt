Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected, forming a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected, forming a triangle <0, 4, 7>.
    - Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected, forming a triangle <0, 7, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    - No triangles possible with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - No triangles possible with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    - No triangles possible with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    - No triangles possible with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
  
* Node 6:
    - No triangles possible with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - No triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    - No triangles possible with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    - No triangles possible with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0)

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles are <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 9>.
