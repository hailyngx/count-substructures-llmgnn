Response:
Following the steps outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 7), but since 4 and 7 are both smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 triangles in the given graph.
