Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node. Triangle: <0, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node. Triangle: <0, 4, 2>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node. Triangle: <0, 4, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Does not form a triangle because Node 1 is smaller than both 6 and 9.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> Does not form a triangle because Node 1 is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Does not form a triangle because Node 2 is smaller than both 4 and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node. Triangle: <3, 9, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node. Triangle: <3, 9, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node. Triangle: <4, 9, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node. Triangle: <4, 9, 1>.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node. Triangle: <4, 8, 5>.
    * Pair 4: (0, 6) -> Does not form a triangle because Node 4 is smaller than both 0 and 6.
    * Pair 5: (0, 2) -> Does not form a triangle because Node 4 is smaller than both 0 and 2.
    * Pair 6: (0, 3) -> Does not form a triangle because Node 4 is smaller than both 0 and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node. Triangle: <6, 9, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Does not form a triangle because Node 6 is smaller than both 1 and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node. Triangle: <7, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node. Triangle: <8, 9, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
