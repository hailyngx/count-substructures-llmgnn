Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as illustrated in the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 4) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (9, 6) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (9, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 2) in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (0, 4) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5 triangles] in the given graph.
