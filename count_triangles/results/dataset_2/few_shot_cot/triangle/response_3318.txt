Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Node 2 and Node 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 18) -> Node 2 and Node 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 18) -> Node 5 and Node 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 18>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Node 5 and Node 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (13, 19) -> Node 13 and Node 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 13, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Node 2 and Node 9 are directly connected 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <2, 9, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> Node 2 and Node 3 are directly connected 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 2>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 0) -> Node 2 and Node 0 are directly connected 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 0>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 6 to 19:
    * Skipped as no triangle can be formed with at least 2 nodes greater than 6.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6 to 19) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
