Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

1. Node 0:
    - <4, 7, 13> [Triangle formed by 0, 7, and 4]
    - <7, 12, 0> [Triangle formed by 0, 7, and 12]
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - <3, 6, 10> [Triangle formed by 1, 3, and 10]
    - <3, 9, 10> [Triangle formed by 1, 3, and 10]
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes linked to Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - <1, 10, 13> [Triangle formed by 3, 1, and 10]
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes linked to Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes linked to Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - <10, 11, 6> [Triangle formed by 6, 11, and 10]
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes linked to Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes linked to Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - <9, 10, 14> [Triangle formed by 9, 10, and 14]
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes linked to Node 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes linked to Node 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes linked to Node 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 13:
    - <0, 7, 13> [Triangle formed by 13, 7, and 0]
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

15. Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes linked to Node 14.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 13) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
