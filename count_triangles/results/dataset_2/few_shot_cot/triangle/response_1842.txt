Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* The process will continue for nodes 8 to 19.
