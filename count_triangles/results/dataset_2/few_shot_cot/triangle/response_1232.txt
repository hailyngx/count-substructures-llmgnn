Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles step-by-step for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) - 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) - 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 1) - 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 14) - 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) - 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 10) - 0 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) - 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving 0, 1, and 3 are skipped as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) - 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pairs involving 0, 1, and 2 are skipped as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pairs involving 0, 1, 2, and 3 are skipped as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) - 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) - 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pairs involving 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are skipped as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (14, 10) - 14 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <8, 6, 4>, <8, 11, 4>, <13, 6, 4>, <5, 13, 2>, <0, 5, 14>, <3, 9, 4>.

So, the final answer is [6].
