Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
