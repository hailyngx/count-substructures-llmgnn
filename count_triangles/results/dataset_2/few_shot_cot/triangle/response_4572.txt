Response:
Following the step-by-step method provided in the example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 5 and 4 in the list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 5 and 7 in the list.
    - Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 5 and 3 in the list.
    - Pair 4: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 4 and 7 in the list.
    - Pair 5: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 4 and 3 in the list.
    - Pair 6: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 7 and 3 in the list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 6 and 2 in the list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 9 and 4 in the list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 9 and 7 in the list.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 4 and 7 in the list.
    - Pair 4: (4, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 2, 4, and 3.
    - Pair 5: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 7 and 3 in the list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 4 and 6 in the list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 4 and 7 in the list.
    - Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 3, 4, and 2.
    - Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 6 and 7 in the list.
    - Pair 5: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 6 and 2 in the list.
    - Pair 6: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 7 and 2 in the list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 4, 9, and 2.
    - Pair 2: (0, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 4, 0, and 3.
    - Pair 3: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 6 and 2 in the list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 9 and 0 in the list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 9 and 7 in the list.
    - Pair 3: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 9 and 3 in the list.
    - Pair 4: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 0 and 7 in the list.
    - Pair 5: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 0 and 3 in the list.
    - Pair 6: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 7 and 3 in the list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 6, 5, and 4.
    - Pair 2: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 5 and 3 in the list.
    - Pair 3: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 4 and 3 in the list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 0 and 3 in the list.
    - Pair 2: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as there are no edges between 2 and 3 in the list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8, 9:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. [6]
