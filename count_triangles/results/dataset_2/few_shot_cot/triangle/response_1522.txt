Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Nodes 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 15) -> Nodes 2 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 15) -> Nodes 3 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (9, 17) -> Nodes 9 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 19) -> Nodes 9 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.
