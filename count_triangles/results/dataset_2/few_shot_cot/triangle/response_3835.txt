Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Connected through Node 11. (11, 17) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 3) -> Connected through Node 11. (11, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> Connected through Node 15. (15, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 5) -> Connected through Node 15. (15, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Connected through Node 5. (3, 5) is in the edge list. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Connected through Node 5. (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> Connected through Node 5. (5, 10) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Connected through Node 7. (7, 10) is in the edge list. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> Connected through Node 7. (7, 12) is in the edge list. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 19) -> Connected through Node 1. (1, 19) is in the edge list. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 19>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Connected through Node 3. (3, 5) is in the edge list. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 19>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> Connected through Node 2. (2, 5) is in the edge list. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> Connected through Node 12. (12, 18) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 13) -> Connected through Node 15. (15, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> Connected through Node 15. (15, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Connected through Node 10. (10, 11) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (18, 3) -> Connected through Node 18. (18, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * No triangles can be formed as these nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
