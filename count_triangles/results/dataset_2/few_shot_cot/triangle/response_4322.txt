Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as shown in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> Connected.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped for not having at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
