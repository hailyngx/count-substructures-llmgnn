Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Not connected as (4, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Not connected as (3, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Not connected as (3, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Not connected as (0, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
