Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as before to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Forms a triangle with Node 14: <0, 6, 9>
  * Pair 2: (6, 14) - Forms a triangle with Node 8: <0, 6, 14>
  * Pair 3: (6, 8) - Does not form a triangle.
  * Pair 4: (9, 14) - Forms a triangle with Node 13: <0, 9, 14>
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 6, 1>
  * Pair 2: (6, 12) - Does not form a triangle.
  * Pair 3: (6, 7) - Forms a triangle with Node 5: <1, 5, 6>
  * Pair 4: (6, 11) - Does not form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (9, 3) - Forms a triangle with Node 13: <2, 3, 13>
  * Pair 2: (9, 13) - Forms a triangle with Node 14: <2, 9, 13>
  * Pair 3: (9, 11) - Forms a triangle with Node 6: <2, 6, 9>
  * Pair 4: (3, 13) - Forms a triangle with Node 8: <2, 3, 8>
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Does not form a triangle.
  * Pair 2: (5, 14) - Does not form a triangle.
  * Pair 3: (8, 14) - Does not form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (5, 12) - Forms a triangle with Node 1: <1, 4, 12>
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Forms a triangle with Node 1: <1, 5, 6>
  * Pair 2: (6, 14) - Does not form a triangle.
  * Pair 3: (7, 14) - Forms a triangle with Node 13: <5, 7, 14>
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (7, 13) - Does not form a triangle.
  * Pair 2: (7, 8) - Does not form a triangle.
  * Pair 3: (8, 13) - Does not form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (5, 13) - Does not form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Pair 1: (0, 14) - Forms a triangle with Node 3: <0, 3, 8>
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
  * Pair 1: (2, 13) - Forms a triangle with Node 14: <2, 9, 13>
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
  * Pair 1: (9, 12) - Does not form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
  * Pair 1: (2, 6) - Forms a triangle with Node 9: <2, 6, 11>
  * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
  * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Forms a triangle with Node 5: <1, 4, 12>

* Node 13:
  * Pair 1: (2, 14) - Does not form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
  * Pair 1: (0, 8) - Forms a triangle with Node 3: <0, 3, 14>

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = [16]

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.
