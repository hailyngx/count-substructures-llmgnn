Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (21, 8) -> 21 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 13) -> 21 and 13 are directly connected as (0, 21) and (0, 13) are in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as (1, 2) and (1, 3) are in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are also connected as (2, 8) and (2, 9) are in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 2) -> 15 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 1 are also connected as (1, 2) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 28) -> 3 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 28 are also connected as (3, 28) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 24) -> 10 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 20) -> 4 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 20 are also connected as (4, 20) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (14, 29) -> 14 and 29 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (22, 20) -> 22 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 27) -> 6 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 27 are also connected as (6, 27) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (17, 21) -> 17 and 21 are directly connected which forms a triangle with 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 25) -> 13 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 26) -> 2 and 26 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, and onward:
    * There are no pairs to consider as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 7
* The unique triangles found are <0, 13, 21>, <1, 2, 3>, <2, 8, 9>, <2, 1, 3>, <4, 20, 6>, <6, 27, 28>, and <7, 17, 21>.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
