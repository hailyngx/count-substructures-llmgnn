* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) - No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (1, 11) - No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (1, 2) - No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) - No triangle.
    * Pair 7: (5, 12) - No triangle.
    * Pair 8: (7, 12) - No triangle.
    * Pair 9: (0, 6) - No triangle.
    * Pair 10: (0, 9) - No triangle.
    * Pair 11: (0, 11) - No triangle.
    * Pair 12: (0, 2) - No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (12, 5) - No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) - No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) - No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (7, 5) - No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (7, 12) - No triangle.
    * Pair 7: (11, 14) - No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) - No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) - No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) - No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) - No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) - No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (12, 5) - No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (12, 7) - No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (12, 2) - No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) - No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) - No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) - No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) - No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) - No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) - No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) - No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) - No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (1, 7) - No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as there isn't a set of at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
