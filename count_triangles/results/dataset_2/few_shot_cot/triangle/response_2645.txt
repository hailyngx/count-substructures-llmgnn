Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 4 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <4, 7, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No direct connection. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> No direct connection. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> No direct connection. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
