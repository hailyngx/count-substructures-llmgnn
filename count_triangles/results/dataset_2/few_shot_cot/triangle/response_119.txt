Response:
Following the step-by-step approach provided in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are connected as (1, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 0) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 3 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 1 are connected as (3, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 6 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 0 are connected as (5, 0) in the edge list.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
