Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's identify the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>.
    - Pair 9: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 10: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (6, 3) -> Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>.
    - Pair 2: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed: <3, 1, 6>.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 1, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <3, 1, 6>]
