Response:
Following the same method as the previous example to count triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 10 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 14), but since 8 and 14 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and 13 and 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [5].
