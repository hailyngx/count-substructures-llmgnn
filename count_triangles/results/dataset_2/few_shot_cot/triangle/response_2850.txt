Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <0, 7, 17>
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16: <0, 5, 7>
    * Pair 3: (17, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12: <1, 3, 12>
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <1, 3, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipped because all potential pairs involve nodes smaller than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12: <1, 12, 19>
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <1, 3, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skipped because all potential pairs involve nodes smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16: <0, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (0, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skipped because all potential pairs involve nodes smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 15) -> No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <1, 3, 4>

    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <1, 3, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skipped because all potential pairs involve nodes smaller than 12.

* Node 13:
    * Not connected to any other nodes.

* Node 14:
    * Skipped because all potential pairs involve nodes smaller than 14.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10: <7, 10, 17>
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Skipped because all potential pairs involve nodes smaller than 17.

* Node 18:
    * Skipped because all potential pairs involve nodes smaller than 18.

* Node 19:

    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles: [2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) = 10]

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 7, 17>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 12, 19>, <1, 3, 12>, <7, 10, 17>, and <7, 10, 17>.
