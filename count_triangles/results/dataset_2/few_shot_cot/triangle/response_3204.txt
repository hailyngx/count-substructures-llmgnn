Response:
Following the same method explained in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) - Node 6, 1, and 14 -> Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) - Node 6, 14, and 13 -> Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<6, 1, 14>, <6, 14, 13>)

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) - Node 6, 13, and 14 -> Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<6, 13, 14>)

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) - Node 6, 3, and 5 -> Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<6, 3, 5>)

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * No triangles can be formed as they do not have at least 2 nodes with higher numbers connected to them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
[<6, 1, 14>, <6, 14, 13>, <6, 13, 14>, <6, 3, 5>].
