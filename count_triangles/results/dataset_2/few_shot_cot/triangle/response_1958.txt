Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 13>
    * Pair 2: (12, 14) -> Triangle formed: <1, 12, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 13>
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Triangle formed: <1, 3, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 3) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 13>
    * Pair 3: (13, 0) -> Triangle formed: <0, 13, 4>
    * Pair 4: (13, 2) -> Triangle formed: <2, 13, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: Skipped, as both nodes are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there are no 2 other nodes greater than each of these nodes to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5-9) + 0 (Nodes 10-14) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
