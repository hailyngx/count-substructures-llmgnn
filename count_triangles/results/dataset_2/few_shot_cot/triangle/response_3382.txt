Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 23) -> 5 and 23 are not connected in the provided edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 23) -> 0 and 23 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 29) -> 5 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 29) -> 1 and 29 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (21, 13) -> 21 and 13 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (21, 16) -> 21 and 16 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (20, 13) -> 20 and 13 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 25) -> 7 and 25 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 24) -> 8 and 24 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 9 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (10, 20) -> 10 and 20 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

The process will continue for Nodes 11 to 29. Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph after counting triangles for all nodes.

Total triangles in the graph = Sum of triangles from all nodes
Total triangles = [1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + ...]
Total triangles = [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + ...]

Total triangles = [11]

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [11].
