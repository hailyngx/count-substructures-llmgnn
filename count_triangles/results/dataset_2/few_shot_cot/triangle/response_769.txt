Response:
Following the steps described in the example using the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 8, 2>
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> Triangle formed: <0, 8, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> Triangle formed: <1, 8, 2>
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> Triangle formed: <1, 8, 10>
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> Triangle formed: <1, 8, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 1>
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Triangle formed: <3, 6, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed: <4, 9, 14>
    * Pair 2: (13, 5) -> Triangle formed: <4, 13, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> Triangle formed: <5, 6, 12>
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> Triangle formed: <5, 6, 11>
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> Triangle formed: <5, 6, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 7) -> Triangle formed: <6, 10, 7>
    * Pair 2: (10, 1) -> Triangle formed: <6, 10, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Triangle formed: <7, 10, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No pairs with higher numbered nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (14, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs with higher numbered nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No pairs with higher numbered nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles:
[<0, 8, 2>, <0, 8, 1>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 8, 10>, <1, 8, 12>, <2, 4, 1>, <3, 6, 13>, <4, 9, 14>, <4, 13, 5>, <5, 6, 12>, <5, 6, 11>, <5, 6, 14>, <6, 10, 7>, <6, 10, 1>, <7, 10, 14>]

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
