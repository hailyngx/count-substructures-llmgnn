Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 5: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Skip all pairs that include Node 2 as it is smaller than Node 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip all pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    - Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    - Skip all pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    - Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
