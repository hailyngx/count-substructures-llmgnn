Response:
Following the method shown in the example provided, we will find the number of triangles formed in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 10 are also connected as (5, 10) shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 4: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

After calculating the triangles formed starting from each node and summing them up, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the graph.
