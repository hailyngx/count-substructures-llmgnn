Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example above, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 29) -> 9 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (19, 29) -> 19 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 29) -> 17 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (17, 25) -> 17 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 4) -> 17 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (29, 25) -> 29 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 24) -> 6 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 23) -> 9 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (25, 18) -> 25 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 7, 26, 27: No triangles can be formed with them.

Continue the process for the remaining nodes...

[<4, 28, 18>, <6, 13, 21>, <8, 15, 19>, <11, 23, 9>, <16, 18, 28>, <17, 25, 1>, <21, 24, 16>, <25, 18, 10>, <0, 9, 18>, <0, 19, 15>, <1, 25, 17>, <3, 9, 0>, <3, 9, 23>, <4, 25, 18>, <6, 12, 1>, <6, 13, 17>, <6, 13, 7>, <6, 22, 25>, <14, 15, 23>, <23, 3, 21>, <29, 0, 19>]

Therefore, there are [20] triangles in the given graph.
