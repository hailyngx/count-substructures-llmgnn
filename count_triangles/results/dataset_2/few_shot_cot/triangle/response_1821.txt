Response:
Following the method shown in the example, we will count the triangles based on each node in the graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (15, 23) -> 15 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (15, 0) (0, 23) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (16, 23) -> 16 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge directly connecting them. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip pairs involving Node 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are all smaller than 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are all smaller than 4.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are all smaller than 5.

        * Node 8:
            * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are all smaller than 8.

        * Node 9:
            * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are all smaller than 9.

            * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are all smaller than 10.
            * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

        The final answer is [1].
