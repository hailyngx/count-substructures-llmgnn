Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 2>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 1) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> Triangle already counted with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Triangle formed: <7, 9, 0>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
