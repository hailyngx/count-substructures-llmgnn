Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 2: (1, 12) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 3: (1, 18) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 4: (2, 12) -> Connected.
    - Pair 5: (2, 18) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 6: (12, 18) -> Connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest: 2
    - <0, 2, 12>
    - <0, 12, 18>

* Node 1:
    - Skip any smaller nodes.
    - No possible triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any smaller nodes.
    - No possible triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any smaller nodes.
    - No possible triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Connected.
    - Pair 2: (8, 6) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest: 1
    - <4, 5, 8>

* Node 5:
    - Skip any smaller nodes.
    - No possible triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any smaller nodes.
    - No possible triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (18, 19) -> Not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Connected.
    - Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 3: (9, 13) -> Connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest: 1
    - <8, 5, 9>

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
