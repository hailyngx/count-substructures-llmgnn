Response:
Following the instructions given in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph step by step for each node:

1. Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as one of the vertices since it does not have at least two nodes greater than node 0.

2. Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as one of the vertices since it does not have at least two nodes greater than node 1.

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Both 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 13 are connected as (1, 13). Triangle formed: <1, 2, 13>.
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 5 are connected as (1, 5). Triangle formed: <1, 2, 5>.
    - Pair 3: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 13 are also connected as (2, 13). Triangle formed: <2, 1, 13>.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 2.

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (2, 13) -> Both 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 13 are connected as (2, 13). Triangle formed: <2, 3, 13>.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 3.

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 5 are connected as (1, 5). Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 4.

6. Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as one of the vertices since it does not have at least two nodes greater than node 5.

7. Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as one of the vertices since it does not have at least two nodes greater than node 6.

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as one of the vertices since it does not have at least two nodes greater than node 7.

9. Node 8:
    - Pending...

10. Node 9:
    - Pending...

11. Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but 0 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 10.

12. Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as one of the vertices since it does not have at least two nodes greater than node 11.

13. Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as one of the vertices since it does not have at least two nodes greater than node 12.

14. Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as one of the vertices since it does not have at least two nodes greater than node 13.

15. Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as one of the vertices since it does not have at least two nodes greater than node 14.

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph by summing up the triangles found with each node.
