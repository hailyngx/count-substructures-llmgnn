Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's proceed with counting the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 15 and 18 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 15 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * [Unique triangles for Node 2]: <2, 3, 15>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 18 and 19 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 14 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 14 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than their value to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
