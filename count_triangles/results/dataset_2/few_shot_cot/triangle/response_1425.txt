Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 0

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed since 0 and 9 are directly connected, but 0 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 4, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0 and 1).
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 4, 7>
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 4, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (1 and 2).
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed since 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 2, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed since 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed since 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 6, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No nodes remaining for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No nodes remaining for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed since 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: <7, 8, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No nodes remaining for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No nodes remaining for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
