Response:
Following the provided graph information, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> Both 8 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 18) -> Both 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 17) -> Both 8 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 18) -> Both 16 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (16, 17) -> Both 16 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (18, 17) -> Both 18 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pairs involving Node 1 are smaller than Node 1, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving Node 2 are smaller than Node 2, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.    
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.    
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Only one pair involving Node 7 available but it's smaller than Node 7 itself, hence no triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be formed as every other node is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Only one possible pair (7, 15), but they are both smaller than 10. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Only one possible pair (9, 2), but both are smaller than 17. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, which involves nodes 8, 18, and 0.
