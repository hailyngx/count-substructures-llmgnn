Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. However, there is no third node connected to both 0 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. However, there is no third node connected to both 3 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. However, there is no third node connected to both 5 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. However, there is no third node connected to both 7 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. However, there is no third node connected to both 3 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. However, there is no third node connected to both 6 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip this node as there are no 2 nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. However, there is no third node connected to both 1 and 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip this node as there are no 2 nodes greater than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip this node as there are no 2 nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip this node as there are no 2 nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
