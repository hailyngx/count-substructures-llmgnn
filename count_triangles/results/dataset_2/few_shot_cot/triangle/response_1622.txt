Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 20) -> 5 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 20) -> 9 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (9, 20) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (11, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (20, 8) -> 20 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (13, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (18, 29) -> 18 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (18, 29) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 24) -> 12 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (12, 24) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 20) -> 11 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

No need to calculate further since we only found triangles with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 7 as the smallest numbered node.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
