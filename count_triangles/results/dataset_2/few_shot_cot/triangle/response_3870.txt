Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph by examining each node step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) - Both 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) - Both 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) - Both 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 16) - Both 3 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) - Both 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) - Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No new triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) - Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) - Both 8 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No new triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Continuing this process for Nodes 10 to 19:

* Node 10: No new triangles formed.
* Node 11: No new triangles formed.
* Node 12: No new triangles formed.
* Node 13: No new triangles formed.
* Node 14: No new triangles formed.
* Node 15: No new triangles formed.
* Node 16: No new triangles formed.
* Node 17: No new triangles formed.
* Node 18: No new triangles formed.
* Node 19: No new triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
