Response:
Following the same process as in the example, let's count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 17) -> Triangle formed with node 4 and 17.
    - Pair 2: (4, 3) -> Triangle formed with node 4 and 3.
    - Pair 3: (17, 3) -> Nodes 17 and 3 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 11) -> Triangle formed with node 2 and 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (11, 29) -> Nodes 11 and 29 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (11, 25) -> Triangle formed with node 11 and 25.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 29) -> Triangle formed with node 0 and 29.
    - Pair 2: (0, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 0 and 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (0, 19) -> Triangle formed with node 0 and 19.
    - Pair 2: (0, 24) -> Triangle formed with node 0 and 24.
    - Pair 3: (17, 19) -> Nodes 17 and 19 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (14, 28) -> Nodes 14 and 28 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (14, 25) -> Triangle formed with node 14 and 25.
    - Pair 3: (14, 20) -> Triangle formed with node 14 and 20.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 28) -> Triangle formed with node 8 and 28.
    - Pair 2: (8, 16) -> Nodes 8 and 16 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (12, 6) -> Triangle formed with node 12 and 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (14, 23) -> Triangle formed with node 14 and 23.
    - Pair 2: (23, 26) -> Nodes 23 and 26 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (16, 13) -> Nodes 16 and 13 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (12, 6) -> Triangle formed with node 12 and 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (24, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 24 and 9.
    - Pair 2: (23, 25) -> Triangle formed with node 23 and 25.
    - Pair 3: (13, 27) -> Nodes 13 and 27 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    - Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

* Node 20:
    - Pair 1: (6, 22) -> Nodes 6 and 22 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 29) -> Triangle formed with node 6 and 29.
    - Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
    - Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 20) = 17.

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph.
