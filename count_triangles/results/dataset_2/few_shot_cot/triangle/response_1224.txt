Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 8, and node 2

Response:
Following the process from the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Form a triangle with Node 5.
  * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed with Node 7.
  * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> Form a triangle with Node 1.
  * Pair 4: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed with Node 3.
  * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> Already counted.
  * Pair 6: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed with Node 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> Form a triangle with Node 5.
  * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed with Node 9.
  * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed with Node 0.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed with Node 8.
  * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Form a triangle with Node 6.
  * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed with Node 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> No triangle formed with Node 6.
  * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> No triangle formed with Node 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Form a triangle with Node 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No triangles with Node 7 as it doesn't have any triple connections.

* Node 8:
  * No triangles with Node 8 as it doesn't have any triple connections.

* Node 9:
  * No triangles with Node 9 as it doesn't have any triple connections.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
