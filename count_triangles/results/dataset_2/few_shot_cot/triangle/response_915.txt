Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 14 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 18 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 17 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 12 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (14, 3) -> 14 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 11 and 14 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (16, 10) -> 16 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 16 and 10 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The process should now continue for Nodes 10 to 19. Let's tally up the triangles after all nodes have been accounted for.
