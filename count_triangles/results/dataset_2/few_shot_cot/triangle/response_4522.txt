Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the same steps as in the example provided with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) - Node 0, 9, and 5 form a triangle. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - Node 1, 4, and 9 form a triangle. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Node 2, 4, and 9 form a triangle. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Node 1, 4, and 9 form a triangle. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) - Node 0, 9, and 5 form a triangle. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) - Node 0, 7, and 5 form a triangle. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
