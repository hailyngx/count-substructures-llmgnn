Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 0 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0 and Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
