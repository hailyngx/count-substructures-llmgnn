Response:
Following the step-by-step process as explained in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (17, 2) -> 17 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (17, 13) -> 17 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  - Pairs involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  - Pairs involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  - Pairs involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  - Pairs involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  - Pairs involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  - Pairs involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  - Pairs involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  - Pairs involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 16:
  - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 16.

* Node 17:
  - Pairs involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
  - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 18 to 22:
  - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 22.

* Node 23:
  - Pairs involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
  - Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 24 to 28:
  - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 28.

* Node 29:
  - Pairs involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
  - Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 [ ]

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
