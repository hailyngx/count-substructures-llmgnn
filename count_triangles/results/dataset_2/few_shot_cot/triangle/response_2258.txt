Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 2, 4>.

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 4, 5>.
    
    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, or 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[<0, 2, 4>] 

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
