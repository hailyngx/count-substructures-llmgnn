Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

Node 0:
* Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
* Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 6) shown in the edge list.
* Pair 4: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
* Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Node 1:
* Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
* Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 2:
* Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
* Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Both 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
* Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 3:
* Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
* Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Both 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 3: (9, 0) -> Both 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 4: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (9, 4) shown in the edge list.
* Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 4:
* Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Both 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 5:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
* Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 6:
* Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
* Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 7:
* Skip any pairs as there are no other nodes greater than Node 7 to form triangles.
* Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 8 and Node 9:
* Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
