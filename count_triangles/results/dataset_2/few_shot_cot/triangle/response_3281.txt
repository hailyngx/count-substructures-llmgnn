Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> Already counted in the previous steps.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * No possible triangle for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (1, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (4, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (5, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * No possible triangle for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle for Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangle for Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangle for Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangle for Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangle for Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangle for Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
