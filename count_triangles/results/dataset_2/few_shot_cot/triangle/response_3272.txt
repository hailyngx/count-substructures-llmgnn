Response:
Following the step-by-step approach mentioned in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 7) -> 17 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 17 and 7 are also connected as (17, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 10 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 26) -> 3 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 28) -> 3 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 26) -> 4 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 26 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 29) -> 9 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 23) -> 11 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and 11 and 23 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19, Node 20, Node 21, Node 22, Node 23, Node 24, Node 25, Node 26, Node 27, Node 28, Node 29:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
