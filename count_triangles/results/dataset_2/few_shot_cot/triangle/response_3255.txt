Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
	* Pair 1: (6, 9) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Pair 2: (6, 5) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Pair 3: (6, 1) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Pair 4: (6, 2) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Pair 5: (9, 5) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Pair 6: (9, 1) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Pair 7: (9, 2) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Pair 8: (5, 1) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Pair 9: (5, 2) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Pair 10: (1, 2) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
	* Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
	* Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
	* Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
	* Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
	* Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
	* Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
	* Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
	* Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
	* Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
	* Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
	* Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 6.
	* Pair 1: (9, 5) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Pair 2: (9, 1) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Pair 3: (9, 2) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Pair 4: (5, 1) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Pair 5: (5, 2) - Connected, triangle formed with Node 6.
	* Pair 6: (1, 2) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
	* Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
	* Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
	* Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
	* Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
	* Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 9.
	* Pair 1: (5, 1) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Pair 2: (5, 2) - Connected, triangle formed with Node 9.
	* Pair 3: (1, 2) - Not connected, so no triangle.
	* Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
