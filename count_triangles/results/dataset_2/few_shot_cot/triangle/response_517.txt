Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0)

Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (8, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Finally, the number of triangles in the given graph is: [0].

There are no triangles in the given graph.
