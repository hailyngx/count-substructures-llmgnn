Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No edge between 5 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. 
    * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. 
    * Pair 6: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. 
    * Pair 7: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No edge between 5 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
