Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 26) -> 14 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 27) -> 14 and 27 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 26) -> 5 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 26 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 27) -> 5 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 27 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 28) -> 8 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 28 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (18, 28) -> 18 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 18 and 28 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 13 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (13, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 27) -> 7 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 27 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

[<1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 27>, <2, 8, 18>, <2, 8, 28>, <2, 18, 28>, <4, 7, 27>]
