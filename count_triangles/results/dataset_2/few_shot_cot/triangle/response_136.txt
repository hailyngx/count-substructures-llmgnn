Response:
Following the same method as the example provided earlier, we will count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node: 

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (16, 11) -> 16 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (0, 17) -> 0 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (28, 29) -> 28 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16:
            * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

        * Node 17:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
            * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) +  0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 17) = 0.

        Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

        The final answer is: [0].
