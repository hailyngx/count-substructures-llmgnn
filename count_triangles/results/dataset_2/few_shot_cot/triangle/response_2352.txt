Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (20, 22) -> 20 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (20, 18) -> 20 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 18) -> 22 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (27, 18) -> 27 and 18 are not directly connected as shown in the edges list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 22) -> 7 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 22 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to form triangles since there is only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16, 17, 18, 19, 20:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 21:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 22:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 23, 24, 25, 26:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 27:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 28:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 29:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
