Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list. Note: This edge also appears in the edge list as (9, 4).
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> Both 9 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (9, 10) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (11, 14) shown in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Both 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5 and Node 6:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 5 or 6.

Continuing for Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge directly connecting them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (12, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> Both 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are connected as (6, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Both 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected as (0, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (10, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> Both 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are connected as (3, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
