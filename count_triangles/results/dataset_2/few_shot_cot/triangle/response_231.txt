Response:
Following the example provided, I will determine the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 11.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 12.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 13.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 14.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 10) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
