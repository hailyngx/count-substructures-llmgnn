Response:
Following the same method outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0 and 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0. They are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0 and 6 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0. They are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 is not directly connected to 3. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 is not directly connected to 8. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 0) -> 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 is a 1-hop neighbor of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 is a 1-hop neighbor of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - No further triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph. 
[<0, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 0, 4>, <4, 5, 6>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 3>, <8, 3, 4>, <8, 3, 6>, <9, 7, 8>]
