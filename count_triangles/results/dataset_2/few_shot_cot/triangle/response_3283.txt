Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip remaining pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No more potential triangles with other nodes larger than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skip remaining pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No potential triangles with other nodes larger than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4 as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * No more potential triangles with other nodes larger than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more potential triangles with other nodes larger than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6 as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected.
    * No more potential triangles with other nodes larger than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No potential triangles with other nodes larger than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No potential triangles with other nodes larger than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. 
    * No more potential triangles with other nodes larger than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [5].
