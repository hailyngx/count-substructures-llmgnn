Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Form a triangle with Node 1 (0, 6, 11)
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> Form a triangle with Node 1 (0, 6, 1)
    * Pair 3: (11, 1) -> Form a triangle with Node 1 (0, 11, 1)
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 (1, 9, 5)
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> Form a triangle with Node 11 (2, 8, 11)
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 (2, 8, 5)
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 7 (2, 8, 7)
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 7 (3, 9, 7)
    * Pair 3: (13, 4) -> Form a triangle with Node 4 (3, 13, 4)
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> Form a triangle with Node 10 (5, 13, 10)
    * Pair 2: (13, 11) -> Form a triangle with Node 11 (5, 13, 11)
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> Form a triangle with Node 11 (5, 11, 8)
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 3 (7, 9, 3)
    * Pair 3: (13, 10) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as they don't form triangles with at least 2 other nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles are: 
<0, 6, 11>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 11, 1>
<1, 9, 5>
<2, 8, 11>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 8, 7>
<3, 9, 7>
<3, 13, 4>
<5, 13, 10>
<5, 13, 11>
<5, 11, 8>
<7, 9, 3>.
