Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.
