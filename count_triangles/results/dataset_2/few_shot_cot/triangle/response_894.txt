Response:
Following the same process as in the previous example, we will find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * No connections, no triangles. Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and also connected. Triangle formed <9, 6, 5>.

    * Pair 3: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and also connected. Triangle formed <9, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 8:

    * Pair 2: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node as all its neighbors are smaller. Total triangles: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node as all its neighbors are smaller. Total triangles: 0

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node as all its neighbors are smaller. Total triangles: 0

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node as all its neighbors are smaller. Total triangles: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
