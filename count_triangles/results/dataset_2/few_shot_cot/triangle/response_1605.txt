Response:
Following the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed because 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed because 1 and 10 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> No triangle formed because 1 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 10 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed because 10 and 12 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed because 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> No triangle formed because 4 and 10 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> No triangle formed because 4 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 10 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed because 10 and 12 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 11 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> No triangle formed because 14 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (14, 15) -> No triangle formed because 14 and 15 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (14, 18) -> No triangle formed because 14 and 18 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (15, 17) -> No triangle formed because 15 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (15, 18) -> No triangle formed because 15 and 18 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (17, 18) -> No triangle formed because 17 and 18 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed because 9 and 13 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 19) -> No triangle formed because 9 and 19 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (13, 19) -> No triangle formed because 13 and 19 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7 to 19:
    * These nodes do not have any pairs that form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Nodes 7 to 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's sum up the total number of triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Nodes 7 to 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
