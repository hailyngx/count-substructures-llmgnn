Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
   - Skipped because pairs with nodes smaller than 4 have already been considered.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
   - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. **Node 10:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. **Node 11:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. **Node 12:**
    - Skipped because pairs with nodes smaller than 12 have already been considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. **Node 13:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. **Node 14:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
