Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 19) -> Not connected directly.
    * Pair 4: (15, 19) -> Not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> Not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (9, 13), but since 9 and 13 are both smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 14, 5>
<2, 18, 7>
<6, 12, 17>
<5, 14, 16>
<3, 18, 15>
<1, 6, 17>
<5, 16, 14>
<0, 3, 18>
