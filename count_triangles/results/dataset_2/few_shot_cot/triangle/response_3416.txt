Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
  - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  - Pair 1: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
