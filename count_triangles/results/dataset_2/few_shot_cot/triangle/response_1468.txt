Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: Skipped because no pair can be formed with just one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Both 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Both 3 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Both 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
