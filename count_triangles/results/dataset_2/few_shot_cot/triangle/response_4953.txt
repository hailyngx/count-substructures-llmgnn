Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 3) -> 13 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 3) -> 17 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (14, 29) -> 14 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (29, 16) -> 29 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (29, 18) -> 29 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (19, 10) -> 19 and 10 are connected. Check if they have a common neighbor.
      - They share Node 8 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <2, 10, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (16, 10) -> 16 and 10 are connected. Check if they have a common neighbor.
      - They share Node 8 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <4, 10, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (28, 29) -> 28 and 29 are connected. Check if they have a common neighbor.
      - They share Node 5 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <5, 28, 29>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (15, 22) -> 15 and 22 are connected. Check if they have a common neighbor.
      - They share Node 25 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <9, 15, 22>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

These steps can be continued for the remaining nodes to calculate the total number of triangles in the graph. 
Following this method, please find the total count of triangles in the graph and list the unique triangles found inside brackets.
