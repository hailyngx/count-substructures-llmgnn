Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 4, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <1, 2, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <2, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <2, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <0, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <0, 3, 8>
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <2, 3, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Calculating the total number of triangles: 
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
