Response:
Let's start finding the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> They are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (10, 19) -> They are connected. Next, check other connections.
      - Pair 2.1: (0, 10) -> They are connected. Next, check other connections.
        - Pair 2.1.1: (0, 19) -> They are connected as well. Triangle formed: <0, 10, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
