Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 12 are connected. 
    * Pair 4: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 13 are connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 0) -> 10 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (10, 5) -> 10 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
