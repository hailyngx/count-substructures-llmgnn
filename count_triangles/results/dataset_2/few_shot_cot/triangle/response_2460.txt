Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (8, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (9, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (11, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (8, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip Node 0 and Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (6, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (9, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6 have previously formed triangles in the counting process and will not form additional triangles with larger numbered nodes.

* Node 7:
    * The previous triangles from 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will continue.

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 0, 1, 2, and 8.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) ->  6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected as (6, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 have all been involved in previous triangles but will be considered for any remaining triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 10

Therefore, the answer is [10].
