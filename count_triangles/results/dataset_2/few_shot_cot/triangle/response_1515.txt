Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 8 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 1 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
