Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the same method described earlier, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> Triangle formed as 5 and 2 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> Triangle formed as 9 and 3 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
