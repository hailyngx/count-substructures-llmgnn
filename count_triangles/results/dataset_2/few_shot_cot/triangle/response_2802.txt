Response:
Following the method shown in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 11 are also connected as (4, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 10 are also connected as (7, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 13 are also connected as (4, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 14 are also connected as (4, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * ...
    (Continue this process for Nodes 2 to 14)

After calculating for all nodes, the total number of triangles in the graph: [15]
