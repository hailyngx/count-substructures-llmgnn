Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle <0, 5, 8>.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle <1, 6, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle <3, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing the process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
