Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph for each node:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Form a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node <0, 4, 14>.
  * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Both 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> Both 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node, but no other connection with 13, so no triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (14, 1) -> Both 14 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node, but no other connection with 1, so no triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (14, 13) -> Both 14 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node, but no other connection with 13, so no triangle formed.
  * Pair 7: (14, 6) -> Both 14 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node. No direct connection between 14 and 6 or any other node connected to 6. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 8: (1, 13) -> Both 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 9: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 10: (13, 6) -> Both 13 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node. No direct connection between 13 and 6 or any other node connected to 6. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Both 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (9, 19) -> Both 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (0, 19) -> Both 0 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node, but no other connection with 19, so no triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skipped all pairs involving Node 0 or 1.
  * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node <2, 9, 3>.
  * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> Both 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> Form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node <2, 3, 11>.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Form a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node <2, 3, 6>.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skipped all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (17, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node <4, 8, 17>.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes will give the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed with the calculation.
