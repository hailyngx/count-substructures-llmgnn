Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 1) -> No triangle formed between nodes 0, 13, and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 10 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 11 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 14 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 10 and 14 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * All these nodes have smaller neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with them as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
[<3, 5, 1>, <6, 13, 4>, <6, 10, 4>, <6, 11, 4>, <6, 14, 4>]

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
