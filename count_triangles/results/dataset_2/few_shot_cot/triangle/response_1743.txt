Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as shown in the example with the provided graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 1 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 1 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 6: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 7: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (9, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 8: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 9: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 10: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
        * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 8: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 9: (14, 0) -> 14 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 14 and 0 are not directly connected as there is no edge (14, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 10: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 13 and 0 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Continue the process for Node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 up to Node 15 following the same steps as above.

After repeating the process for all nodes, the brackets [] containing the total number of unique triangles found in the graph will be [11], and the unique triangles will be listed inside <> such as <0, 4, 5>.
