Response:
Following the same logic as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) - 13 and 16 are connected to 0 and are connected to each other forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (13, 18) - 13 and 18 are connected to 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 18) - 16 and 18 are connected to 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) - 10 and 12 are connected to 1 and are connected to each other forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (10, 2) - 10 and 2 are not connected even though they are both connected to 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 17) - 10 and 17 are not connected even though they are both connected to 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 2) - 12 and 2 are connected to 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 17) - 12 and 17 are connected to 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 17) - 2 and 17 are connected to 1 and are connected to each other forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) - 14 and 17 are connected to 3 but are not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) - 14 and 19 are not connected even though they are both connected to 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 19) - 17 and 19 are connected to 3 and are connected to each other forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) - 10 and 12 are connected to 8 and are connected to each other forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) - 10 and 11 are connected to 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) - 11 and 12 are connected to 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) - 9 and 11 are connected to 9 and are connected to each other forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 15) - 9 and 15 are connected to 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 15) - 11 and 15 are connected to 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10 and 11:
    * Skipped since we already included them in other nodes' triangles.

* Nodes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
