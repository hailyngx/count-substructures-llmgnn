Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the previous example, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Directly connected in the edge list.
    * No more pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No connected triangles for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No connected triangles for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No connected triangles for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Directly connected in the edge list.
    * No more pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No connected triangles for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No connected triangles for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No connected triangles for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No connected triangles for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No connected triangles for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 29: No triangles can be formed starting from these nodes as all the potential pairs are with smaller nodes.

After computing for all nodes, let's calculate the total number of triangles: 
Total triangles = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
