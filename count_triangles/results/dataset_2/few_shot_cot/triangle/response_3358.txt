Response:
Following the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph. Step-by-step calculations for each node are as follows:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 from hereon.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected as there is no edge between 2 and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
Finally, the unique triangles found are: 
<1, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>

The final answer is [8].
