Response:
Following the step-by-step instructions given in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 3) -> 11 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 8) -> 12 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
  * Pair 1: (17, 9) -> 17 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (17, 9). Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
   * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
