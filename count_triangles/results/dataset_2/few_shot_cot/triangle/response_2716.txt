Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are directly connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 8), but since 3 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
