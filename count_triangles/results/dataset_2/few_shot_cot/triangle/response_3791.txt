Response:
Following the same step-by-step process detailed in the previous example to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 6: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 7: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Skip Node 9 as it only has 1 triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they all have smaller adjacent nodes for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
