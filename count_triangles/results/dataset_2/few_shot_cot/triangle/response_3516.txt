        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because there is no edge directly connecting them in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
