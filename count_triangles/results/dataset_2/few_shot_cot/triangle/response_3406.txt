Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are not connected despite being 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 1) -> 17 and 1 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 1) -> 18 and 1 are directly connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are not connected despite being 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with only 1 neighbor.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1 or no neighboring nodes.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with only 1 neighbor.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1 neighbor.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (0, 18) -> 0 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 15) -> 0 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 15) -> 18 and 15 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1 neighbor.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1 neighbor.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1 neighbor.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1 neighbor.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1 neighbor.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1 neighbor.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1 neighbor.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1 neighbor.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 
So the output will be [5].
