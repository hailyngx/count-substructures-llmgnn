Response:
Following the provided example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Check for the third node.
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Check if a triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Check for the third node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11:
    * Similar to Nodes 0 and 1, no triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (15, 14) -> 15 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected. Check for the third node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Similar to Node 13, no triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
