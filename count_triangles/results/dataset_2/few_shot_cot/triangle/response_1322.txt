Response:
Following the same step-by-step process explained in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Skip Node 0 as it only has 2 neighbors which are smaller.

* Node 1:
    * Skip Node 1 as the other nodes are smaller.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip Node 3 as it only has 3 neighbors which are smaller.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 10 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 8 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 10 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 11 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 8 as the other nodes are smaller.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 15 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip Node 10 as all other nodes are smaller.

* Node 11:
    * Skip Node 11 as it only has 5 neighbors which are smaller.

* Node 12:
    * Skip Node 12 as it only has 3 neighbors which are smaller.

* Node 13:
    * Skip Node 13 as it only has 1 neighbor which is smaller.

* Node 14:
    * Skip Node 14 as it only has 1 neighbor which is smaller.

* Node 15:
    * Skip Node 15 as it only has 1 neighbor which is smaller.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (18, 7) -> 18 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, but 18 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip Node 17 as it only has 3 neighbors which are smaller.

* Node 18:
    * Skip Node 18 as all other nodes are smaller.

* Node 19:
    * Skip Node 19 as it only has 2 neighbors which are smaller.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
