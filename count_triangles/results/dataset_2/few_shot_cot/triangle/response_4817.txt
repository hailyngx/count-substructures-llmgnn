Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Total Triangles: 0

* Node 1:
    - Total Triangles: 0

* Node 2:
    - Total Triangles: 0

* Node 3:
    - Total Triangles: 0

* Node 4:
    - Total Triangles: 0

* Node 5:
    - Total Triangles: 1. Triangle: <5, 9, 13>

* Node 6:
    - Total Triangles: 0

* Node 7:
    - Total Triangles: 0

* Node 8:
    - Total Triangles: 0

* Node 9:
    - Total Triangles: 0

* Node 10:
    - Total Triangles: 0

* Node 11:
    - Total Triangles: 0

* Node 12:
    - Total Triangles: 1. Triangle: <9, 12, 6>

* Node 13:
    - Total Triangles: 0

* Node 14:
    - Total Triangles: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: [2]

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 9, 13>
<9, 12, 6>
