Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 1) -> 15 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (0, 18) -> 0 and 18 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (15, 14) -> 15 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Calculating the total number of triangles by adding up the triangles found for each node:
Total triangles = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 + 1 (Node 8) + 0 + 1 (Node 10) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 + 0
Total triangles = 7

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
