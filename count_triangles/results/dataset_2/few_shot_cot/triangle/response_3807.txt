Response:
Following the step-by-step approach illustrated in the sample for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (7, 14) - 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 14 are connected as (7, 14) shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (13, 15) - 13 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (13, 18) - 13 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (13, 9) - 13 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (13, 9) in the edge list.
        * Pair 4: (15, 18) - 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (15, 18) in the edge list.
        * Pair 5: (15, 14) - 15 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (4, 11) - 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (4, 11) in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8:
        * Similar pairs with smaller nodes are considered. No triangles are formed.
        * Total triangles for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (9, 14) - 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (9, 14) in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 10:
        * Pair 1: (10, 12) - 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 11:
        * Pair 1: (11, 17) - 11 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are connected as (11, 17) in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Nodes 12, 13:
        * Similar pairs with smaller nodes are considered. No triangles are formed.
        * Total triangles for Nodes 12, 13: 0

    * Nodes 14, 15:
        * Only pairs with smaller nodes to form triangles are considered, but no triangles are formed.
        * Total triangles for Nodes 14, 15: 0

    * Nodes 16, 17, 18:
        * Similar pairs with smaller nodes are considered, but no triangles are formed.
        * Total triangles for Nodes 16, 17, 18: 0

    * Node 19:
        * Not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles can be formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 19: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
