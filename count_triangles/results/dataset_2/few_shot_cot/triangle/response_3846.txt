Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the given graph:
  
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
