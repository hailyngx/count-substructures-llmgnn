Response:
Following the example provided, we will identify and count the triangles for each node in the graph as follows:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 0 are also connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    - Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4 and Node 5:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 4 or 5.

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
