Response:
Following the approach shown in the example while calculating triangles for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 2>
            * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 15>
            * Pair 3: (0, 11) -> Triangle formed: <0, 11, 21>
            * Pair 4: (0, 22) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (0, 23) -> No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 27) -> No triangle formed.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 4:
            * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Continue this process for Nodes 5 to 29 following the patterns and skipping smaller numbered nodes.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = Sum of triangles formed by each node.
        * Count the total number of unique triangles and output them inside one pair of brackets [].

        Proceed with calculating triangles by following the steps for each node diligently, and determine the total number of triangles in the graph once all nodes are covered.
