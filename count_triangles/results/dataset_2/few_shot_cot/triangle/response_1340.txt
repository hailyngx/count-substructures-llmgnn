Response:
Following the step-by-step process applied to each node in the graph to count the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 1) -> 16 and 1 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected in the edge list. However, node 2 is not part of this triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are connected in the edge list. However, node 2 is not part of this triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected in the edge list. However, node 3 is not part of this triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected in the edge list. However, node 4 is not part of this triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 7) -> 10 and 7 are connected in the edge list. However, node 5 is not part of this triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are connected in the edge list. However, node 8 is not part of this triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are connected in the edge list. However, node 10 is not part of this triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11 to 19:
    * Skipped as they have no triangles with at least 2 other nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
