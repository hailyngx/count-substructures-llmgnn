Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 29) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
