Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are not connected as there is no edge (3, 18) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 15 are not connected as there is no edge (4, 15) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 10) -> 17 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 17 and 10 are not connected as there is no edge (17, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 9) -> 15 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected as there is no edge (15, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (15, 11) -> 15 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (15, 11) in the edge list. Triangle formed: <4, 15, 11>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected as there is no edge (8, 16) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (13, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8: 0
    
* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as (14, 18) in the edge list. Triangle formed: <10, 14, 18>.
    * Total triangles with Node 10: 1

(Skipping Nodes 11 to 19 as they all follow the same process of checking pairs).

Continuing the process for Nodes 11 to 19:
* Node 11: No triangles formed.
* Node 12: No triangles formed.
* Node 13: No triangles formed.
* Node 14: No triangles formed.
* Node 15: No triangles formed.
* Node 16: No triangles formed.
* Node 17: No triangles formed.
* Node 18: No triangles formed.
* Node 19: No triangles formed.

Calculating the total number of triangles by adding all nodes' triangles together: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
