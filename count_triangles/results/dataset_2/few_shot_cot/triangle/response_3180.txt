Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (10, 17) -> Both 10 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (19, 6) -> 19 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (7, 24) -> 7 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (22, 25) -> 22 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes larger than 5 to form triangles with.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * No additional triangles can be formed as all other nodes are smaller than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Continuing this process for the remaining nodes...

    * Node 8:
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 10:
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 11:
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 4

    * Node 12:
        * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes larger than 12 to form triangles with.
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 13:
        * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 14:
        * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 15:
        * No triangles can be formed since this node is not connected to any other node.
        * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 16:
        * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 17:
        * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 18:
        * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 19:
        * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 20:
        * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 21:
        * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 22:
        * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 23:
        * No triangles can be formed since this node is not connected to any other node.
        * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 24:
        * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 25:
        * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 26 to 29:
        * No triangles can be formed since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

    Summing up all the triangles found for each node:

    * Total triangles in the graph = Sum of triangles found for each node

    So, [   ]
