Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (18, 29) -> 18 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 23) -> 18 and 23 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 15) -> 18 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (29, 23) -> 29 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (29, 15) -> 29 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (23, 15) -> 23 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipping same logic as Node 0, the total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping same logic as Node 0, the total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skipping same logic as Node 0, the total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (29, 27) -> 29 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Skipping other pairs involving Node 14, the total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 20:
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 21 to 29:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
