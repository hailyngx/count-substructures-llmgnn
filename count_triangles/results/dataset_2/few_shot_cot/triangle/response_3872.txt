Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is: [6].
