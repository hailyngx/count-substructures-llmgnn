Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
        * No triangles found for Node 0

    * Node 1:
        * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
        * No triangles found for Node 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
        * No triangles found for Node 2

    * Node 3:
        * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
        * Pair 1: (9, 12) - 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 9 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
        * No triangles found for Node 4

    * Node 5:
        * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes: 6, 7, 8, 9
        * No triangles found for Node 5

    * Node 6:
        * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes: 7, 8, 9
        * No triangles found for Node 6

    * Node 7:
        * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes: 8, 9
        * Pair 1: (4, 13) - 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes: 9
        * No triangles found for Node 8

    * Node 9:
        * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes
        * No triangles found for Node 9

    * Node 10:
        * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes
        * No triangles found for Node 10

    * Node 11:
        * No triangles found for Node 11

    * Node 12:
        * No triangles found for Node 12

    * Node 13:
        * No triangles found for Node 13

    * Node 14:
        * No triangles found for Node 14

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
