Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> This pair was already considered with the 1st pair.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> This pair was already considered with the 1st pair.
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) -> This pair was already considered with the 2nd pair.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 5 are also connected as (2, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 5 are also connected as (8, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> This pair was already considered with the 1st pair.
    * Pair 4: (7, 0) -> This pair was already considered with the 2nd pair.
    * Pair 5: (7, 5) -> This pair was already considered with the 1st pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> This pair was already considered with the 2nd pair.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
