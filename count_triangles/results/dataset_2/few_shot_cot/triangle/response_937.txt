Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (18, 26) -> Both 18 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (18, 23) -> Both 18 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (26, 23) -> Both 26 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (15, 7) -> Both 15 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (15, 24) -> Both 15 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 24) -> Both 7 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
