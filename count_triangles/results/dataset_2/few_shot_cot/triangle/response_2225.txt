Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 17) -> 1 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 9) -> 10 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 9) -> 17 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 10 since they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue the process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 3: 2 triangles
* Node 4: 0 triangles
* Node 5: 0 triangles
* Node 6: 2 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 2 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 2 triangles
* Node 14: 6 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 2 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 4 triangles
* Node 19: 4 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 6 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 24.

Therefore, there are 24 triangles in the given graph.
