Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 0, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 0, 1). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (6, 3, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (6, 4, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7: Triangles cannot be formed with a combination of nodes greater than them, so they are skipped.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (4, 8, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (6, 9, 1). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14: Triangles cannot be formed with a combination of nodes greater than them, so they are skipped.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
[<6, 0, 5>, <6, 0, 1>, <6, 3, 7>, <6, 4, 8>, <8, 4, 11>, <9, 1, 6>]
