Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected in the graph. 
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected in the graph.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2. 
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected in the graph. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected in the graph. 
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. 
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected in the graph. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 4 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
