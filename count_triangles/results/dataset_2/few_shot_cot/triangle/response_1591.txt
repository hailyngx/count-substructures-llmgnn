Response:
Following the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 since they are smaller than Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.  Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Node 2 since it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip the pair with Node 3 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pair with Node 4 since it is smaller than Node 3.
    * No possible pairs with two nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 since they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 since they are smaller than Node 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 since they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Node 9 since it is smaller than Node 8.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
