Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are directly connected but not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are directly connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are directly connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are directly connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 1 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are directly connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are directly connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 4), but since 3 and 4 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 1 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 4 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
