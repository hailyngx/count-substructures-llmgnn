Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge (1, 16) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 26) -> 17 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge (17, 26) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 24) -> 4 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected as there is no edge (4, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 24) -> 7 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected as there is no edge (7, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (24, 6) -> 24 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 24 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (24, 10) -> 24 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected as there is no edge (24, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 29) -> 15 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 15 and 29 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (15, 24) -> 15 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (15, 24) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (29, 24) -> 29 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 29 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue the process for the remaining nodes to find all the triangles in the graph. Then, sum up the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found inside <> each as shown in the example. Finally, provide the final answer inside brackets [].
