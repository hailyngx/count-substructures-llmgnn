Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are connected through Node 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected through Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles form with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles form with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles form with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles form with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skip because they have smaller nodes to form triangles with.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are directly connected through Node 10. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are directly connected through Node 13. Triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles form with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles form with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 12) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
