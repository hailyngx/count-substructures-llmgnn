Response:
Following the same method as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No edge exists between these two nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> No edge exists between these two nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 10) -> No edge exists between these two nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 13 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> No edge exists between these two nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> No edge exists between these two nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 10) -> No edge exists between these two nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> No edge exists between these two nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> No edge exists between these two nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> No edge exists between these two nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> No edge exists between these two nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 5, 6, 7, 8 have been skipped due to being smaller than at least one connected node.

Continuing with Node 9:

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> No edge exists between these two nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> No edge exists between these two nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> No edge exists between these two nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing with Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14: Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
