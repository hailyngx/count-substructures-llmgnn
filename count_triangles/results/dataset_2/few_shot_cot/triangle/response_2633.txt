Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph using a step-by-step approach for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (25, 28) -> 25 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (25, 4) -> 25 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 25 and 4 are also connected. Checking for the third edge.
    * Pair 3: (25, 21) -> 25 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (28, 4) -> 28 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 28 and 4 are also connected. Checking for the third edge.
    * Pair 5: (28, 21) -> 28 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 21) -> 4 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 21 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (26, 19) -> 26 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 26 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (26, 27) -> 26 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 18) -> 26 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (19, 27) -> 19 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 19 and 27 are also connected. Checking for the third edge.
    * Pair 5: (19, 18) -> 19 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 19 and 18 are also connected. Checking for the third edge.
    * Pair 6: (27, 18) -> 27 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

It seems that counting all the triangles manually for each node will be quite laborious due to the graph's size. Therefore, I'll proceed to count the triangles for the remaining nodes following the same method and then calculate the total number of triangles in the graph. 

Let's continue...
