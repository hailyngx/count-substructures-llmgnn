Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge (0, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node = 1

* Node 8:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
