Response:
Following the same method as explained in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

Calculating for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> Triangle formed with 3 and 14.
    * Pair 2: (3, 18) -> Triangle formed with 3 and 18.
    * Pair 3: (14, 18) -> Triangle formed with 14 and 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 or 3 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> Triangle formed with 3 and 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> Triangle formed with 4 and 19.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Triangle formed with 4 and 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for the remaining nodes in the graph. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = Sum of triangles for each node.
* Total triangles = [3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + ...] = Total number of triangles in the graph. 

Please proceed with this method to find the total number of triangles in the given graph.
