Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (20, 22) -> 20 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (21, 29) -> 21 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pair to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pair to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pair to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pair to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15:
    * No triangle can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node as there are no other nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

* Node 16:
    * No pair to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (6, 25) -> 6 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 17, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26:
    * No triangle can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node as there are no other nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

* Node 27:
    * No pair to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 28:
    * No pair to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 29:
    * Pair 1: (18, 29) -> 18 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 29, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: <4, 7, 9>, <6, 14, 17>, <18, 29, 7>
