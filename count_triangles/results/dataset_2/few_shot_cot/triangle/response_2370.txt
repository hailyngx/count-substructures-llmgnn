Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same step-by-step process as the example with the provided information:

* Node 0:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected (8, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Formed by nodes 3, 4, and 8)

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
