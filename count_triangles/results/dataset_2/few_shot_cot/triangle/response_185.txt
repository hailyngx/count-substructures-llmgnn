Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Skip
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Skip
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Skip
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> Skip
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (9, 3) -> Skip
    * Pair 8: (9, 6) -> Skip
    * Pair 9: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 11: (1, 9) -> Skip
    * Pair 12: (1, 0) -> Skip
    * Pair 13: (1, 3) -> Skip
    * Pair 14: (1, 4) -> Skip
    * Pair 15: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 16: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 17: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 18: (3, 4) -> Skip
    * Pair 19: (4, 1) -> Skip
    * Pair 20: (4, 3) -> Skip
    * Pair 21: (4, 8) -> Skip
    * Pair 22: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 23: (8, 4) -> Skip
    * Pair 24: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 25: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

The process will be continued for Nodes 1 to 9 now.

* Node 1:
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing:
* Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer in brackets is [8].
