Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as nodes 1, 10 are smaller than node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as nodes 4, 7, 8, 12 are smaller than node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as nodes 7, 13 are smaller than node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as nodes 10, 11, 12 are smaller than node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: Skipped as nodes 9, 10 are smaller than node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as nodes 11, 12 are smaller than node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as nodes 10 are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, 5, 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11 to Node 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 11, 12, 13, or 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
