Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example mentioned earlier, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are connected through Node 2. No triangle formed as 14 is not a neighbor of Node 5 or Node 13.
            * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are connected through Node 5. No triangle formed as 13 is not a neighbor of Node 2 or Node 14.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected through Node 3. No triangle formed as 13 is not a neighbor of Node 10.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected through Node 4. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are connected through Node 4. No triangle formed as 5 is not a neighbor of Node 12.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected through Node 2. No triangle formed as 6 is not a neighbor of Node 10.
            * Pair 6: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are connected through Node 10. No triangle formed as 13 is not a neighbor of Node 11.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are connected through Node 8. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Pair 1: (12, 4) -> 12 and 4 are connected through Node 9. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 10:
            * Pair 1: (13, 3) -> 13 and 3 are connected through Node 10. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 11:
            * Pair 1: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
            * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 12, 13, or 14 to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) = 0.

        Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
