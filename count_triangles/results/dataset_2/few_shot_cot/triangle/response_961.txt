Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 and Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 and Node 11.
    * No other triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 7.
    * No other triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 4.
    * No other triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No additional triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 and Node 11.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 and Node 14.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 11 and Node 13.
    * No other triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 12.
    * No other triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No additional triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 and Node 5.
    * No other triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * No triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No additional triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * No triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
