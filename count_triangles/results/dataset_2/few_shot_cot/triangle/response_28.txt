Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with Node 0 being the starting node, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are connected and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are connected and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are connected but are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are connected and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are connected and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are connected and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are connected and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 9) -> 13 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are connected and are both 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
