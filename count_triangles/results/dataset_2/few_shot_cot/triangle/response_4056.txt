Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 2 are also connected as (8, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.

    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 11 and 7 are also connected as (11, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 11 and 5 are also connected as (11, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 10 and 11 are also connected as (10, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (14, 5) -> 14 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 14 and 5 are also connected as (14, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
