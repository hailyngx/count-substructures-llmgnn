Response:
Following the step-by-step process illustrated in the previous example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 0 and 10 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 3 and 10 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

Given the calculations above, the number of triangles in the graph is [12].

The unique triangles found are:

* <2, 11, 12>
* <2, 11, 3>
* <3, 6, 12>
