Response:
Following the same procedure as described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> Form a triangle with Node 13 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 7 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> Form a triangle with Node 11 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> Form a triangle with Node 7 and Node 11 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 2.
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) -> Form a triangle with Node 7 and Node 13 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 2.
    * Pair 5: (11, 13) -> Form a triangle with Node 11 and Node 13 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 and Node 7 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 3.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 7 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 7 and Node 8 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 7 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 10 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> Form a triangle with Node 10 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Form a triangle with Node 8 and Node 14 as 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 16.
