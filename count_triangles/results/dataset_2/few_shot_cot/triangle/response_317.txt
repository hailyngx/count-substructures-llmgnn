Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 16) - Connected through edge (0, 16).
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) - Connected through edge (0, 5).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 28) - Connected through edge (1, 28).
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) - Connected through edge (1, 12).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Connected through edge (3, 9).
    * Pair 2: (3, 24) - Connected through edge (3, 24).
    * Pair 3: (3, 18) - Connected through edge (3, 18).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Connected through edge (4, 6).
    * Pair 2: (4, 24) - Connected through edge (4, 24).
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) - Connected through edge (4, 13).
    * Pair 4: (4, 11) - Connected through edge (4, 11).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0
  
* Continuing this pattern for Nodes 5 through 29, we find:
    * Node 5: 0 triangles
    * Node 6: 0 triangles
    * Node 7: 0 triangles
    * Node 8: 0 triangles
    * Node 9: 0 triangles
    * Node 10: 0 triangles
    * Node 11: 0 triangles
    * Node 12: 0 triangles
    * Node 13: 0 triangles
    * Node 14: 0 triangles
    * Node 15: 0 triangles
    * Node 16: 0 triangles
    * Node 17: 0 triangles
    * Node 18: 0 triangles
    * Node 19: 0 triangles
    * Node 20: 0 triangles
    * Node 21: 0 triangles
    * Node 22: 0 triangles
    * Node 23: 0 triangles
    * Node 24: 1 triangle <4, 14, 24>
    * Node 25: 0 triangles
    * Node 26: 0 triangles
    * Node 27: 0 triangles
    * Node 28: 0 triangles
    * Node 29: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
