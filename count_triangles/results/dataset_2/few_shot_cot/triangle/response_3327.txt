Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, since they are smaller than 2.
    * Triangle formed with Node 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, as they are smaller than 8.
    * Triangle formed with Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skip these nodes as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than their value to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
