Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Pair 5: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Pair 6: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2 and Node 3:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 2 or 3.

Continuing this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected in the graph.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

Hence, the final answer is [4].
