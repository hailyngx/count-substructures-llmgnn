Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> Triangle formed with Node 28: <0, 14, 16>
  * No other pairs found for Node 0.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * No pairs found for Node 1.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
  * No pairs found for Node 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
