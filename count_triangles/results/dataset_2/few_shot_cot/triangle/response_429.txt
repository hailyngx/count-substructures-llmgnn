Response:
Following the step-by-step process described above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 25) - Both 17 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (17, 25) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 28) - Both 0 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 28) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 25) - Both 0 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 25) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 24) - Both 0 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 24) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Continue the same process for Nodes 10 to 29.

[<0, 17, 25>, <0, 24, 28>]

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
