Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Node 1 and Node 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> Node 1 and Node 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 16) -> Node 3 and Node 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or smaller. No other nodes can form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or smaller. No other nodes can form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> Node 15 and Node 19 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 12) -> Node 15 and Node 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 12) -> Node 19 and Node 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Node 9 and Node 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> Node 9 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 5) -> Node 12 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes can form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes can form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (11, 9) -> Node 11 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> Node 9 and Node 16 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Node 12 and Node 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
