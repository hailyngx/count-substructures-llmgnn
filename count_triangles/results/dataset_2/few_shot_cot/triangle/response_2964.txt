Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 5: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 0 are also connected as (6, 0) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
            * No more triangles involving Node 4. 

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        
        * Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
            * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than their value to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 9.

        Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
