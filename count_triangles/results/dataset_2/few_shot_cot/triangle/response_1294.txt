Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in this graph by analyzing each node:

* Node 0:
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are connected to 1, and they are connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 15) - 10 and 15 are connected to 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) - 1 and 2 are connected to 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) - 2 and 15 are connected to each other. No other node to form additional triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (25, 9) - 25 and 9 are connected to 3, and they are connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 28) - 5 and 28 are connected to each other. No other node to form additional triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) - 14 and 16 are connected to 7, and they are connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 21) - 8 and 21 are connected to each other. No other node to form additional triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * No triangles can be formed using these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 20:
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 21:
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * No triangles can be formed using these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
