Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> Connected. Proceed to check if (4, 10) and (10, 11) are connected: No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 10) -> Connected. Proceed to check if (10, 4) and (4, 11) are connected: No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> Connected. Proceed to check if (10, 11) and (11, 4) are connected: No triangle formed.
    * No more unique triangles found with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (16, 4) -> Connected. Proceed to check if (4, 19) and (19, 16) are connected: No triangle formed.
    * No more unique triangles found with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Connected. Proceed to check if (5, 2) and (2, 3) are connected: No triangle formed.
    * No more unique triangles found with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 9) -> Connected. Proceed to check if (9, 14) and (14, 15) are connected: No triangle formed.
    * No more unique triangles found with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> Connected. Proceed to check if (18, 7) and (7, 10) are connected: No triangle formed.
    * No more unique triangles found with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (15, 14) -> Connected. Proceed to check if (14, 9) and (9, 15) are connected: No triangle formed.
    * No more unique triangles found with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0
Thus, there are no triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
