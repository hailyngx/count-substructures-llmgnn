Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 2, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 3, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8: <1, 2, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 2, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <2, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <3, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 3, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <0, 3, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
