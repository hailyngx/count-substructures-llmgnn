Following the steps outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Both 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.

    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.

Continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, we will find the total number of triangles in the graph.

[Total number of triangles in the graph: 15]
