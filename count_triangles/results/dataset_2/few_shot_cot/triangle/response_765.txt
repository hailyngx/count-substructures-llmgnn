Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the example above for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: []
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 22) -> 5 and 22 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (21, 13) -> 21 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 29) -> 5 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 20) -> 3 and 20 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 14) -> 16 and 14 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (21, 6) -> 21 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (17, 20) -> 17 and 20 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (21, 17) -> 21 and 17 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 28) -> 10 and 28 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (22, 1) -> 22 and 1 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 23, 24, 27: Not connected to at least two other nodes, so they are skipped.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 28) -> 7 and 28 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (25, 29) -> 25 and 29 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (29, 23) -> 29 and 23 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (26, 14) -> 26 and 14 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28: Each skipped once as they are not the smallest numbered node in any triangle.

* Node 29:
    * Pair 1: (3, 25) -> 3 and 25 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (29, 14) -> 29 and 14 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
