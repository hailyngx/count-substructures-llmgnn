Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (7, 14). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11:
    * No other nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles with them.

* Node 12:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
