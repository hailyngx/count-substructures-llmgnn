Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example for each node:

Node 0:
* Pair 1: (3, 29) -> 3 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
* Pair 2: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
* Pair 3: (16, 29) -> 16 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
* Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 1:
* No possible triangles, as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 1.
* Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 2:
* Pair 1: (13, 26) -> 13 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 2: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 3: (26, 19) -> 26 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 3:
* No possible triangles, as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 3.
* Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 4:
* Pair 1: (23, 5) -> 23 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 23>.
* Pair 2: (23, 29) -> 23 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <4, 23, 29>.
* Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Node 5:
* No possible triangles, as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 5.
* Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 6:
* No possible triangles, as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 6.
* Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 7:
* No possible triangles, as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 7.
* Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 8:
* Pair 1: (15, 13) -> 15 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <8, 13, 15>.
* Pair 2: (15, 26) -> 15 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 3: (15, 22) -> 15 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 4: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 5: (13, 26) -> Already counted above.
* Pair 6: (13, 22) -> 13 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 7: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 8: (26, 22) -> 26 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 9: (26, 18) -> 26 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 10: (22, 18) -> 22 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 9:
* No possible triangles, as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 9.
* Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 10:
* No possible triangles, as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 10.
* Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 11:
* No possible triangles, as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 11.
* Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0
