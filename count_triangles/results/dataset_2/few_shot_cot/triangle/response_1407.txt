Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    <0, 2, 6>
    <0, 2, 9>
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    <1, 4, 7>
    <1, 4, 9>
    <1, 5, 7>
    <1, 5, 9>
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    <2, 4, 5>
    <2, 4, 9>
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    <3, 1, 7>
    <3, 1, 9>
    <3, 8, 5>
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    <5, 7, 8>
    <5, 7, 1>
    <5, 8, 6>
    <5, 8, 9>
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 6:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    <7, 1, 3>
    <7, 1, 9>
    <7, 5, 8>
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 4 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.
