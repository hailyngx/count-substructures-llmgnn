Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 3 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected, hence no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 3 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 3 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are not directly connected, hence no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 3 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

I will now continue to calculate triangles for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's proceed.
