Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) - 6 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) - 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:

    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No more than one triangle to form since there aren't three nodes greater than 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph. 

So, the answer is [1].
