Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (9, 0, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 8). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 2). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 6, 1). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 8). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 6, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (7, 8, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * There are no valid triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * There are no valid triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

The process needs to continue for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 in a similar manner as done for the previous nodes. After calculating for all nodes, we will be able to determine the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's continue with nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 next.
