Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph by following the same step-by-step process as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 5) -> 10 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Other pairs with 1 as the smallest node do not form triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Other pairs with 3 as the smallest node do not form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Other pairs with 4 as the smallest node do not form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Other pairs with 5 as the smallest node do not form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Other pairs with 6 as the smallest node do not form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Other pairs with 8 as the smallest node do not form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Other pairs with 9 as the smallest node do not form triangles.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * Other pairs with 10 as the smallest node do not form triangles.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * Other pairs with 11 as the smallest node do not form triangles.

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * Other pairs with 12 as the smallest node do not form triangles.

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * Other pairs with 13 as the smallest node do not form triangles.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * Other pairs with 14 as the smallest node do not form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 7) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
