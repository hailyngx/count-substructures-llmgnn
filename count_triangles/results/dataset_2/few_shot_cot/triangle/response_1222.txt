Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the sample, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 20) -> 7 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Check the common neighbors: 7 (connected to 0) and 9 (connected to 10). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 29) -> 9 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected. Check the common neighbors: 2 (connected to 24) and 3 (connected to 5). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with only one neighbor Node 18.

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 3 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with only one neighbor Node 29.

* Node 7:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16:
    * Skip these nodes as there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 17:
    * Skip Node 7 as it is smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 18:
    * Skip Node 4 as it is smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 19:
    * Skip Node 5 as it is smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 20:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller. 
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skip these nodes as there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
