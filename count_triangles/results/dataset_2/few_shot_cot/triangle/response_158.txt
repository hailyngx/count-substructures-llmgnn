Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are directly connected as (7, 0, 13) and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> 1 and 17 are directly connected as (1, 17) and are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are directly connected as (1, 2) and are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are directly connected as (1, 12) and are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 23) -> 9 and 23 are directly connected as (9, 23) but are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) and are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as (3, 6) but are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are directly connected as (7, 10) and are 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continue this process for Nodes 11 to 29 once we reach triangles that can be formed with these nodes.

Let's continue the calculation for Nodes 11 to 29 and find the total number of triangles in the graph.
