Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) - Triangle <0, 5, 2>
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - Triangle <0, 5, 9>
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) - Triangle <0, 2, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Triangle <1, 4, 6>
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - Triangle <1, 5, 6>
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) - Triangle <1, 2, 3>
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Triangle <1, 2, 3>
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) - Triangle <3, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) - Triangle <1, 3, 7>
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - Triangle <3, 5, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Triangle <7, 5, 8>
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) - Triangle <3, 5, 7>
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (2, 0) - Triangle <0, 2, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
