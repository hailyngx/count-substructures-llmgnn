Response:
Following the same process as the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 3) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 7: (7, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 8: (7, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 9: (7, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 10: (3, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 11: (3, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 12: (3, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 13: (11, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 14: (11, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 15: (10, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 0) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (8, 7) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are connected by edge (5, 1), but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 2) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 8: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are connected by edge (5, 4), and they are 1-hop neighbors. No other shared neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected by edge (5, 12), but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected by edge (9, 2), and they are 1-hop neighbors. No other shared neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are connected by edge (2, 14), and they are 1-hop neighbors. No other shared neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Let's continue this process for Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

*Total triangles in the graph = [0].

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
