Response:
Following the same process as the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 8, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles for Node 5 as any potential triangle would have nodes smaller than 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles for Node 6 as any potential triangle would have nodes smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles for Node 7 as any potential triangle would have nodes smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles for Node 8 as any potential triangle would have nodes smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles for Node 10 as any potential triangle would have nodes smaller than 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles for Node 11 as any potential triangle would have nodes smaller than 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles for Node 12 as any potential triangle would have nodes smaller than 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles for Node 13 as any potential triangle would have nodes smaller than 13.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles for Node 14 as any potential triangle would have nodes smaller than 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
