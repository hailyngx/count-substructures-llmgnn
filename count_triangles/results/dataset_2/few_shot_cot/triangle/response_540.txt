    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 as they are smaller than 0.
    - Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (12, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (10, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
