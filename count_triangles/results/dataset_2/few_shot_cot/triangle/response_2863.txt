Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (8, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 [Triangles <0, 3, 8> and <0, 8, 18>]

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [Triangle <1, 3, 14>]

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [Triangle <1, 2, 12>]

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [Triangle <4, 12, 19>]

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (13, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2 [Triangles <7, 8, 10> and <7, 13, 17>]

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [Triangle <9, 10, 15>]

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [Triangle <5, 11, 17>]

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15 and Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [Triangle <11, 16, 17>]

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 10

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
