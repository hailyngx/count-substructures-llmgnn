Response:
Following the same methodology as demonstrated in the provided example, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph given:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 5: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 6: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 1 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. Node 3:
    - Node 3 is not part of any triangle as it only has one connection to Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 6 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

6. Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Nodes 8 and 9:
    - Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
