Response:
Following the step-by-step process, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

    * Node 0:
        - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
        - Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as 5 is connected to both 6 and 5, but 6 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        - Pair 3: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
        - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        - Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than Node 1.
        - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        - Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than Node 2.
        - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
