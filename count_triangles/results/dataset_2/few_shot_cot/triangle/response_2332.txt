Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) - Both 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 5) - Both 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) - Both 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) - Both 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
