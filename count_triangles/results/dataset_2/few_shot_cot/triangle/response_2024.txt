Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 11) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 1) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 19) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (11, 1) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (11, 19) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (1, 19) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (10, 0) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (18, 13) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (18, 14) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (18, 7) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (11, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (15, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (16, 14) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (15, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (17, 18) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (15, 11) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangle with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangle with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangle with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangle with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangle with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangle with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangle with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangle with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangle with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangle with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [0].
