Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the process outlined in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 11) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 12 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 10 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Since node 5 has no 1-hop neighbors that are greater in number, it cannot form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, and summing up the total number of triangles formed:

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 9.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
