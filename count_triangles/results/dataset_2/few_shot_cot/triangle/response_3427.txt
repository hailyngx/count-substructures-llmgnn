Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> Connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 5 and 4.
        * Triangle formed: <4, 5, 0>
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 3) -> Connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 7 and 3.
        * Triangle formed: <3, 7, 0>
    * Pair 6: (7, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> Connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 8 and 9.
        * Triangle formed: <8, 9, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 5 and 7.
        * Triangle formed: <2, 5, 7>
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> Connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 5 and 2.
        * Triangle formed: <2, 5, 0>
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 6 and 7.
        * Triangle formed: <6, 7, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> Connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 5 and 0.
        * Triangle formed: <0, 5, 3>
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 5 and 7.
        * Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 5 and 9.
        * Triangle formed: <3, 5, 9>
    * Pair 4: (0, 7) -> Connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 0 and 7.
        * Triangle formed: <0, 7, 3>
    * Pair 5: (0, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 9) -> Connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 0 and 9.
        * Triangle formed: <0, 9, 3>
    * Pair 7: (7, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> Connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 5 and 0.
        * Triangle formed: <0, 5, 4>
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> Connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 0 and 9.
        * Triangle formed: <0, 9, 4>
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 5 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
