Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are directly connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are directly connected as (1, 0) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair (0, 4) as it is already considered.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.

* Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8:
    * Follow the steps as above to find the total triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.
    * Node 6: 1 total triangle
    * Node 7: 2 total triangles
    * Node 8: 2 total triangles

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
