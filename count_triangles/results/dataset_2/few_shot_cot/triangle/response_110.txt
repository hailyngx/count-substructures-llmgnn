Response:
Following the example given above, let's compute the number of triangles in the provided graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected because (4, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (0, 3), but since 0 and 3 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 or 9 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
