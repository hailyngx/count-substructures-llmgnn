Response:
Following the method described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> Node 3 and Node 4 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 11) -> Node 3 and Node 11 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 11) -> Node 4 and Node 11 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> Node 3 and Node 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> Node 3 and Node 12 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Node 7 and Node 14 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Node 7 and Node 11 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
