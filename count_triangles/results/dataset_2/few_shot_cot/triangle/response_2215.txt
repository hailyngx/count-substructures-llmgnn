Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are directly connected as (8, 19) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are directly connected as (11, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are directly connected as (5, 15) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (19, 18) -> 19 and 18 are directly connected as (19, 18) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are directly connected as (8, 17) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 to 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
