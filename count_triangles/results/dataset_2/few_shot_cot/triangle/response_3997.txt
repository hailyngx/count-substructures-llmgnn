Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) - Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 21) - Both 5 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 22) - Both 13 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) - Both 5 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 24) - Both 6 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) - Both 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (16, 26) - Both 16 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17:
    * Skip because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (13, 28) - Both 13 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skip because they are smaller than the corresponding previous nodes considered.

* Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 11) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<5, 21, 1>
<13, 22, 2>
<5, 18, 4>
<11, 13, 7>
<16, 26, 9>
<13, 28, 11>
