Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:
      
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0.
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 3 or greater as they are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 or greater as they are greater than 2. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 4 or greater.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 7 or greater.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 or greater as they are greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 7 or greater.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 7 or greater.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 or greater as they are greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have pairs greater than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
