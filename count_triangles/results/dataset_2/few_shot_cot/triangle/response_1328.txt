Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's 1-hop neighbors and identifying the triangles they form. 

Here are the triangles formed by each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
    * Node 1:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3, as they are smaller than Node 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 10:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 10.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 11:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 11.
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 12:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 12.
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 13:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 13.
        * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 14:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 14.
        * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 15:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 15.
        * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 16:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 16.
        * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 17:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 17.
        * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 18:
        * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3, as they are smaller than Node 18.
        * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 19:
        * No triangles can be formed since there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected for Node 19.
        * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0


Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (All other nodes) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
