Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with 30 nodes and 90 edges graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 24) -> 1 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 25) -> 1 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 22:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 22.
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 23:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 23, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 28) -> 8 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 23, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 24 and Node 25:
