Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (15, 25) -> 15 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (14, 29) -> 14 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process step by step for each remaining node:

* Node 3: 0 triangles
* Node 4: 4 triangles
* Node 5: 0 triangles
* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 10 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 0 triangles
* Node 22: 0 triangles
* Node 23: 0 triangles
* Node 24: 0 triangles
* Node 25: 2 triangles
* Node 26: 0 triangles
* Node 27: 0 triangles
* Node 28: 0 triangles
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
Total triangles in the graph = 18

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
