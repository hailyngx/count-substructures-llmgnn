Response:
Following the same method as shown in the first example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> Connected through Node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Connected through Node 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 7) -> Connected through Node 11. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> Connected through Node 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> Connected through Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Connected through Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 14) -> Connected through Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> Connected through Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 7) -> Connected through Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Connected through Node 12. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> No direct connection. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Connected through Node 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 14) -> Connected through Node 14. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 6) -> Connected through Node 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 6) -> Connected through Node 14. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> Connected through Node 11. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> Connected through Node 12. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> Connected through Node 12. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Connected through Node 10. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> No direct connection. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Connected through Node 14. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped for the same reason that there are not at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
