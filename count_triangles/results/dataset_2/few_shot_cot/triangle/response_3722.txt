Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as the example provided earlier, here is the breakdown for counting the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (19, 28) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    - Pair 2: (19, 28) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (1, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (4, 28) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    - Pair 2: (8, 29) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Great! Let's proceed with Nodes 11, 12, and beyond to complete the triangle counting process.
