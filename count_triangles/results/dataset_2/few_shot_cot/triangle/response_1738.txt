Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are directly connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 8 are directly connected as (0, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 7 are directly connected as (7, 0) shown in the edge list.

    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 8 are directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 9 are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 5 are directly connected as (8, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with all smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
