Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No direct edge between 3 and 6, so no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Node 2 and 6 share a direct edge, but no edge between Node 2 and 6 in the 1-hop neighbor sets.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Node 2 and 6 share a direct edge, but no edge between Node 2 and 6 in the 1-hop neighbor sets.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No direct edge between 4 and 9, so no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No direct edge between 5 and 7, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Node 4 and 9 share a direct edge, but no edge between Node 4 and 9 in the 1-hop neighbor sets.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Node 5 and 7 share a direct edge, but no edge between Node 5 and 7 in the 1-hop neighbor sets.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No direct edge between 5 and 9, so no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No direct edge between 5 and 7, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No direct edge between 7 and 9, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Node 2 and 8 share a direct edge, but no edge between Node 2 and 8 in the 1-hop neighbor sets.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No direct edge between 5 and 9, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Node 2 and 7 share a direct edge, but no edge between Node 2 and 7 in the 1-hop neighbor sets.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: [0]

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
