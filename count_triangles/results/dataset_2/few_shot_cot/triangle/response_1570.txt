Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will go through each node and count the triangles that can be formed with that node as the smallest numbered node. Here are the calculations for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 11) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Pair 2: (17, 9) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Pair 3: (11, 9) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (16, 2) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Pair 2: (16, 9) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 6) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Pair 2: (10, 15) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Pair 3: (6, 15) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Pair 2: (13, 7) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Pair 3: (19, 7) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Pair 2: (14, 17) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Pair 3: (15, 17) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> Connected (Triangle formed: <13, 19, 8>)
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (15, 12) -> Not connected (No triangle)
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Connected (Triangle formed: <0, 4, 17>)
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
[<13, 19, 8>, <0, 4, 17>]

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
