Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 1 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 2 are connected, but there is no node connected to both 4 and 2.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 0 are connected, but there is no node connected to both 4 and 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 1 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected, and both 5 and 8 are connected to 4 forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

So, the answer is [1].
