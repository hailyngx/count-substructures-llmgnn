Response:
Following the example given, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> 1 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 13 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 27) -> 13 and 27 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 27) -> 17 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 17 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (17, 0) -> 17 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 17 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 24) -> 6 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (24, 14) -> 24 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 24 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 10 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (17, 0) -> 17 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 17 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 29) -> 13 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 13 and 29 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

This process will be continued for nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, and so on until all nodes have been considered to calculate the total number of triangles in the graph. The final answer will be provided as [total_number_of_triangles].
