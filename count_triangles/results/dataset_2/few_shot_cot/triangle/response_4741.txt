Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are connected. But no third node is connected to both. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are connected. But no third node is connected to both. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are connected. But no third node is connected to both. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are connected. But no third node is connected to both. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * No pairs possible as there needs to be at least two other nodes to form a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * No pairs possible as there needs to be at least two other nodes to form a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * No pairs possible as there needs to be at least two other nodes to form a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 10 to 19:
        * Skipped as no pair of nodes larger than these can form a triangle.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

    Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
