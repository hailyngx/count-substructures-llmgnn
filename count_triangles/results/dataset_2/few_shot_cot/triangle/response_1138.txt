Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11 triangles] in the given graph.
