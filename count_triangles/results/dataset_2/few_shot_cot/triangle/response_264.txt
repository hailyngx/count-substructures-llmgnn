Response:
This problem involves calculating the number of triangles in a graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges. Let's proceed step-by-step to count the triangles associated with each node individually:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 13.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 14.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 15.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 16.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 17.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 18.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Upon calculating the triangles for each node and summing them up, we get the final count:

[0]
