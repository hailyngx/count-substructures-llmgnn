Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. No triangle formed. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) - > 6 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 4 to 14.

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
