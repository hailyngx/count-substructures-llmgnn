Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are larger than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are larger than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are larger than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are larger than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors and are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skip any other pairs with Nodes 8 and 9 as they are larger than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are larger than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7, and 9 are 1-hop neighbors and are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7, and 8 are 1-hop neighbors and are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8, and 9 are 1-hop neighbors and are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9, and 1 are 1-hop neighbors and are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skip any other pairs with Node 2 as it's larger than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it's larger than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [5].
