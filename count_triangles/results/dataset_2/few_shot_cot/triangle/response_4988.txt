Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 2: (10, 2) -> Both 10 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1**:
    - Pair 1: (13, 29) -> 13 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
    - Pair 2: (13, 20) -> 13 and 20 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2**:
    - Pair 1: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected. Triangle formed. <0, 2, 10>.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3**:
    - Pair 1: (22, 15) -> 22 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 2: (22, 20) -> 22 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not connected. No triangle.

7. **Node 6**:
    - Pair 1: (14, 24) -> 14 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 but not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 2: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are connected. Triangle formed. <6, 14, 16>.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. **Node 7**:

    - Pair 2: (18, 9) -> 18 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 but not connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 28) -> 4 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 but not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are connected. Triangle formed. <4, 8, 19>.
    - Pair 3: (19, 28) -> 19 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are connected. Triangle formed. <8, 19, 28>.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

10. **Node 9**:
    - Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 and are connected. Triangle formed. <9, 13, 14>.
    - Pair 2: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 but not connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

We will continue this process for the rest of the nodes and then count the total number of triangles found at the end.
