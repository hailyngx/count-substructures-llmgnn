Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph based on the adjacency list for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 3) -> 14 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 9) -> 13 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 9) -> 14 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (0, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (8, 4, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for the remaining nodes and count the total number of triangles.

The final answer should be inside brackets [] and unique triangles should be listed inside <>.
