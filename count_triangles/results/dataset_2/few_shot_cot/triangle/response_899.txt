Response:
Following the same method as the provided example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 2 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 2>
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 1 are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 2>
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 7, 8>
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now let's continue for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
