Response:
Following the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Continue to find triangles using Node 2.

Please find the triangles for nodes 2 to 9, and then provide the final count of triangles present in the graph.
