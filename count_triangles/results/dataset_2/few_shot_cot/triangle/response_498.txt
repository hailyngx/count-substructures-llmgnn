Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 0, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 9, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 0, 2, and node 1

Response:
Following the example provided, we will now count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected, but 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are connected, but 4 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 7, 9>.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 7, 2>.
    * Pair 6: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are connected, but 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Continue counting triangles starting from Node 1 following the same process as Node 0.

* Node 2:
    * Continue counting triangles starting from Node 2 following the same process as Node 0.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 4, 5>.
    * Continue counting triangles starting from Node 3 following the same process as Node 0.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Continue counting triangles starting from Node 4 following the same process as Node 0.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skip due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = [Triangles found with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node] + [Triangles found with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node] + [Triangles found with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node] + [Triangles found with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node] + [Triangles found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node] = [Total number of triangles in the graph].
* Therefore, the final answer should be placed inside brackets [] once you have calculated the total number of triangles.
