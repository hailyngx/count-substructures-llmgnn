Response:
Following the process mentioned in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (0, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 2 are also connected as (1, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 0 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, and 9: 
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
