Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> Both 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> Both 9 and 2 are directly connected to 0. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 2) -> Both 15 and 2 are directly connected to 0. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Both 3 and 15 are directly connected to 1. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> Both 3 and 13 are directly connected to 1. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 18) -> Both 3 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> Both 5 and 15 are directly connected to 2. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) -> Both 5 and 16 are directly connected to 2. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> Both 5 and 0 are directly connected to 2. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> Both 1 and 15 are directly connected to 3. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> Both 1 and 13 are directly connected to 3. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 18) -> Both 1 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12: No triangles found.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Both 1 and 14 are directly connected to 13. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> Both 5 and 10 are directly connected to 14. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Both 5 and 13 are directly connected to 14. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 15, 16, 17, 18: No triangles found.

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> Both 10 and 15 are directly connected to 19. One side of the triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
[<0, 2, 15>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 3, 15>, <2, 5, 15>, <10, 15, 19>, <13, 14, 5>]

Therefore, there are 7 unique triangles in the given graph.
