Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**

    * Pair 1: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:**

    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**

    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (19, 20) -> 19 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**

    * Pair 1: (25, 26) -> 25 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4:**

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 10) -> 17 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5:**

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (12, 20) -> 12 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**

    * Pair 1: (16, 23) -> 16 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**

    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. **Node 8:**

    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (12, 24) -> 12 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Continue this process for the remaining nodes.

After calculating the triangles for all nodes and summing them up, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
