Response:
Following the process explained in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected because (1, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as (1, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 2 are also connected as (3, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 2 are also connected as (4, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 4 are also connected as (7, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 4 are also connected as (8, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving 0 and 1 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 3 are also connected as (0, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 4 are also connected as (0, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 5 are also connected as (0, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pairs involving 0 and 1 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs involving 0, 1, and 2 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pairs involving 0, 1, 2, and 3 are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't enough connected nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
