Response:
Following the step-by-step approach provided in the example, we will count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 29) -> 7 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge {7, 6}. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (29, 6) -> 29 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1: Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles are formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge {14, 15}. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 25) -> 14 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (14, 23) -> 14 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (15, 25) -> 15 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge {15, 25}. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (15, 23) -> 15 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge {15, 23}. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (25, 23) -> 25 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 11) -> 17 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge {17, 11}. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 5) -> 17 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge {17, 5}. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipped because the nodes connected to Node 4 are smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped because the nodes connected to Node 5 are smaller than 5.

Continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (26, 19) -> 26 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (26, 29) -> 26 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge {26, 29}. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 29) -> 19 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skipped because the nodes connected to Node 8 are smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (28, 12) -> 28 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge {28, 12}. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
