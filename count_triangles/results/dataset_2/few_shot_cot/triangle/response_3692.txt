Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected because (3, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected because (3, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected because (4, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected because (4, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 9 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are not connected because (5, 0) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 8 and 0 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
