Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 1 are connected as (9, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 1 are connected as (9, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5.

Continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 following the same steps as above.

Finally, calculate the total number of triangles in the graph based on the nodes found to be part of triangles.
Output the final answer inside brackets [].
