Response:
Following the process outlined in the initial example to count triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14)  -> 7 and 14 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12)  -> 7 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (14, 12)  -> 14 and 12 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14)  -> 9 and 14 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2)  -> 9 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6)  -> 9 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (14, 2)  -> 14 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (14, 6)  -> 14 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 6)  -> 2 and 6 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3)  -> 4 and 3 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (13, 3) -> 13 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (10, 3) -> 10 and 3 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than any of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [10].
