Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated earlier, here is how you can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected, but 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 6) -> 1, 6, and 4 form a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
