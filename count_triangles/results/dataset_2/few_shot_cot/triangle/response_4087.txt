Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) <1, 8, 0>
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 8) (found in Node 0)
    - Pair 2: (1, 28) and (1, 13) form a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node <1, 13, 28>
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) (found in Node 0)
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (8, 10) and (8, 27) form a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node <2, 8, 27>
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 3.

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (11, 21) and (11, 20) form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node <4, 11, 21>
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 5.

- Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 6.

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 7.

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) (found in Node 0)
    - Pair 2: (1, 10) and (1, 8) form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node <1, 8, 10>
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 9.

- Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 10.

- Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (2, 21) and (2, 4) form a triangle with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node <2, 4, 21>
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Now, we continue to determine the triangles for Nodes 12 to 29.

- Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 12.

- Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 13.

- Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 14.

    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 16.

- Node 17:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 17.

- Node 18:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 18.

- Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 19.

    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 20.

- Node 21:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 21.

- Node 22:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 22.

- Node 23:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 23.

- Node 24:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 24.

- Node 25:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 25.

- Node 26:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 26.

- Node 27:
    - Pair 1: (24, 27) (found in Node 24)
    - Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 28:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 28.

- Node 29:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 29.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
