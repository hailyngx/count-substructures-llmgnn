Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example to count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 23) - Both 4 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (23, 6) - Both 23 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (25, 29) - Both 25 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (28, 27) - Both 28 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 19.

* Node 20:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 20.

* Node 21:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 21.

* Node 22:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 22.

* Node 23:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 23.

* Node 24:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 24.

* Node 25:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 25.

* Node 26:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 26.

* Node 27:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 27.

* Node 28:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 28.

* Node 29:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 29.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 
  * 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 16) = 3

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
