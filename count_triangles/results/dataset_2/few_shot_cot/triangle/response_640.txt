Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 is connected to 0, 17 is connected to 0, but 7 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> Connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (12, 17) -> 12 is connected to 2, 17 is connected to 2, but 12 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> Connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 6) -> Not a valid pair. Not considering self-loops.
    * Pair 2: (6, 19) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 17) -> Connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (16, 9) -> Connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (19, 14) -> Connected, forming a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> Connected, forming a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No valid triangles as other nodes are smaller than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing for Nodes 10 to 19:

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 13, Node 15: No triangles possible as they only have connections to nodes with smaller numbers.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (16, 13) -> Connected, forming a triangle with Node 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (18, 4) -> Connected, forming a triangle with Node 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * No valid triangles as other nodes are smaller than Node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No valid triangles as other nodes are smaller than Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 unique triangles in the given graph.
