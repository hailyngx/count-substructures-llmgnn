Response:
Following the same process as in the example, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected and also 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are connected and also 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are connected and also 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

After counting the triangles for each node, sum up all the triangles to find the total number of triangles in the graph. Output the final answer inside brackets [].
