Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example for each node in the provided graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 1) -> Both 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 1 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (6, 5) -> Both 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangle can be formed starting from Node 5.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 1 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 11.
Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
