Response:
Following the example provided and given the graph information provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

      * Node 0:
          * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Node 1 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
          * Pair 2: (1, 18) -> Node 1 and Node 18 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
          * Pair 3: (6, 18) -> Node 6 and Node 18 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
          * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

      * Node 1:
          * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
          * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Node 4 and Node 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
          * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> Node 4 and Node 16 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
          * Pair 3: (13, 16) -> Node 13 and Node 16 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
          * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

          * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

      Summarizing the triangles:
      * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

      Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
