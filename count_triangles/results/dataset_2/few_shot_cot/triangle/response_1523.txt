Calculating the total number of triangles by summing the triangles for each node:
Total triangles = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 5 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 22.

Therefore, there are a total of 22 triangles in the given graph.
The list of unique triangles is: 
<0, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 1>, <5, 1, 7>, <4, 0, 12>, <0, 10, 7>, <1, 9, 13>, <8, 5, 3>, <0, 4, 12>, <10, 8, 13>, <0, 12, 4>, <0, 7, 10>, <2, 8, 13>, <3, 1, 5>. 

Thus, the final answer is [22].
