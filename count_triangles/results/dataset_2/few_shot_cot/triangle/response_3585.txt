Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 19) -> 0 and 19 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 12.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 17.

* Node 18 and Node 19:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 18 or 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11 triangles] in the given graph.
