Response:
Following the step-by-step method provided in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 0.

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (10, 7) -> 10 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 10.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (17, 3) -> 17 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 13.

* Node 14:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 14.

* Node 15:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 15.

* Node 16:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 16.

* Node 17:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 17.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (15, 6) -> 15 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 18, and they are also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 19.

Summing up the triangles formed by each node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
[<3, 7, 10>, <6, 11, 12>, <12, 17, 3>, <15, 6, 18>]
