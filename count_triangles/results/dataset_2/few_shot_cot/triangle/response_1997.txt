Response:
Following the step-by-step process demonstrated in the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Processing for Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Processing for Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Processing for Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    - Pair 3: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Processing for Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    - Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Skipping processing for Node 4 as it is already covered in the example.

- Processing for Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors.
    - Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Processing for Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Skipping processing for Node 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as they are either covered in the example or do not form triangles.

- Processing for Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 12.
    - Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Processing for Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors.
    - Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 13.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Skipping processing for Node 14 as it is already covered in the example.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
