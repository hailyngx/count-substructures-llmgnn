Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15.
    * Pair 2: (1, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (2, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 18.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (5, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
