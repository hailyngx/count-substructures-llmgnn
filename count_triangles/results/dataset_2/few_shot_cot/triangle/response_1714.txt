Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as before to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 4: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 6: (14, 0) -> 14 and 0 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (11, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 3: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 3: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 16.

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.
