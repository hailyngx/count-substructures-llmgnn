Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (12, 9) -> 12 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    - Unique triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 4, 12> and <0, 4, 6>

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more pairs for Node 1 to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 4, 5>

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or Node 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more pairs for Node 2 to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 8, 5>

* Node 3:
    - No possible triangles with the given edges for Node 3, since there are no pairs of nodes that are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 and also directly connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more pairs for Node 4 to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 1, 5>

* Node 5:
    - No new triangles can be formed with the remaining nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    - Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more pairs for Node 6 to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <6, 11, 7>

* Rest of the nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
