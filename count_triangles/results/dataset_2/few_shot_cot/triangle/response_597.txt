Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same approach as described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle <0, 1, 3> formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> Triangle <0, 1, 5> formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> Triangle <0, 3, 7> formed.

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Triangle <3, 1, 5> formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
