Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided for counting triangles:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (26, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (26, 28) -> Triangle <0, 26, 28> formed.
    - Pair 3: (11, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (7, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (29, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (9, 21) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (21, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (8, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (26, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
