Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 7

Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0

Response:
Following the same method as explained in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the final answer is [7].
