Response:
Following the step-by-step process, here are the counts of triangles for each node in the graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>
            * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 12>
            * No more unique triangles can be formed with Node 0.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 13>
            * No more unique triangles can be formed with Node 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Triangle formed: <2, 13, 14>
            * Pair 2: (13, 17) -> Triangle formed: <2, 13, 17>
            * No more unique triangles can be formed with Node 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
            * No more unique triangles can be formed with Node 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Triangle formed: <4, 6, 13>
            * No more unique triangles can be formed with Node 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 13:
            * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than the respective node to form triangles.

        * Node 14:
            * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> No triangle formed.
            * No more unique triangles can be formed with Node 14.
            * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
            * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than the respective node to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        [6 triangles found: <0, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 12>, <1, 2, 13>, <2, 13, 14>, <2, 13, 17>, <4, 6, 13>]

        Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
