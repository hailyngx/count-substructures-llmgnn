Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph, we will calculate the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Since these nodes do not have at least 2 other larger numbered nodes to form triangles, they won't be able to form any triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, [2] is the final answer, indicating there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
