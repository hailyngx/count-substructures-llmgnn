* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
