Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 9) -> 14 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11 are smaller than the other nodes in the graph, so we skip these nodes.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
* Node 15:
* Node 16:
* Node 17:
* Node 18:
* Node 19:

Continuing the process for Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19...
