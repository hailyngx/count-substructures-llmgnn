Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph by examining each node's possible triangles. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Both 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected (5, 14) as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> Both 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected (5, 19) as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (14, 19) -> Both 14 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected (14, 19) as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected (5, 7) as shown in the edge list.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No connections to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> Both 14 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected (14, 19) as shown in the edge list.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10: 
    * No triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> Both 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected (5, 19) as shown in the edge list.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * No connections to form triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No more triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 12) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
