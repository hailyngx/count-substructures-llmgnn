Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they share a common neighbor 1. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they share a common neighbor 9. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they share a common neighbor 1. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - The only pair we could consider is (0, 9), but since 0 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
