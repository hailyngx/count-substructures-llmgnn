Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    
* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    
* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    
* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    
* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    
* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
      
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 4>
<1, 0, 2>
<1, 0, 5>
<6, 0, 9>
<8, 3, 7>
