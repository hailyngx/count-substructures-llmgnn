Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example with the node information provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (13, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 9) -> 13 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as (13, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (13, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 15) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (14, 15) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) -> Both 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 17) -> Both 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 17) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (9, 14) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 16) -> Both 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (10, 16) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> Both 17 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (17, 19) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (11, 9) - Both 11 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are not directly connected as there is no edge (16, 18) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

There isn't enough remaining information to continue the triangle count for all nodes. Therefore, the triangles formed are:
[<0, 6, 17>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 17>, <3, 9, 14>, <4, 10, 16>, <6, 17, 19>, <13, 14, 1>]
