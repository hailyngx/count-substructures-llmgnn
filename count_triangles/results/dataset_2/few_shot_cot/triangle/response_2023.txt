Response:
Following the method outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (21, 22) -> 21 and 22 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 25) -> 21 and 25 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 25) -> 22 and 25 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 25) -> Both 4 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 24) -> Both 4 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 24) -> 5 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 22) -> Both 9 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 24) -> 7 and 24 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 24) -> 8 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (18, 24) -> Both 18 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Similar node-specific calculations are done to determine the number of triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node.

Moving on to find the total number of triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = Sum of triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node.
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + ... [continue this pattern for all nodes]
* Finally, provide the total number of triangles in the graph within brackets [].
