Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) - Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) - Both 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) - Both 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (6, 10) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) - Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) - Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (8, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) - Both 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) - Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as (5, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) - Both 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) - Both 0 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also connected as (0, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
