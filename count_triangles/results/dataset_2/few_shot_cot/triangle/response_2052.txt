Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Both 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> Both 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Both 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> Both 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Both 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
