Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Formed a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 2, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Formed a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 5, 9>
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Formed a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 5, 6>
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
