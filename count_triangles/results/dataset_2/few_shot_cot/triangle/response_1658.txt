Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors because there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 2: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors as well.
    * Pair 3: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as (11, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (14, 1) -> 14 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 5: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 6: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as (1, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as (9, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as (9, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 5: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 6: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as (7, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (11, 0) -> Both 11 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 11 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (11, 7) -> Both 11 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (11, 1) -> Both 11 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (0, 7) -> Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (0, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 1) -> Both 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (0, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 1) -> Both 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (13, 14) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 7) -> Both 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (13, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 12) -> Both 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (14, 7) -> Both 14 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (14, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 12) -> Both 14 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 12) -> Both 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (7, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, we will find the total number of triangles in the graph.

[Final Answer: **12** triangles]
