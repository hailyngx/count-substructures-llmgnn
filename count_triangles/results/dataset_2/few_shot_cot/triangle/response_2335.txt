Response:
Following the step-by-step approach, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 9, and 14: <0, 9, 14>.
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 1, 8, and 14: <1, 8, 14>.
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 2, 9, and 10: <2, 9, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 2, 4, and 11: <2, 4, 11>.
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 3, 4, and 11: <3, 4, 11>.
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 4, 11, and 14: <4, 11, 14>.
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 5, 9, and 12: <5, 9, 12>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 5, 8, and 14: <5, 8, 14>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 5, 7, and 10: <5, 7, 10>.
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 7, 3, and 10: <7, 3, 10>.
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 9, 14, and 4: <9, 14, 4>.
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 10, 11, and 4: <10, 11, 4>.
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 13, 0, and 1: <13, 0, 1>.
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
