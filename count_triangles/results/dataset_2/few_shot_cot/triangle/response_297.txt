Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> 1 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

* Summarizing the triangles: 
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph, which are the following unique triangles:
[<1, 7, 0>, <3, 13, 9>, <4, 17, 9>, <4, 17, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <9, 17, 13>]
