    * Pair 1: (14, 7) -> Not a triangle as 14 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (14, 15) -> Not a triangle as 14 and 15 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> Not a triangle as 7 and 3 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 4) -> Not a triangle as 10 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (10, 5) -> Not a triangle as 10 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Not a triangle as 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Not a triangle as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 16) -> Not a triangle as 6 and 16 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> Not a triangle as 7 and 12 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> Not a triangle as 8 and 16 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 15) -> Not a triangle as 8 and 15 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (14, 2) -> Not a triangle as 14 and 2 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 1) -> Not a triangle as 11 and 1 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (11, 3) -> Not a triangle as 11 and 3 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> Triangle formed with 14, 17, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:

    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11 to 19:
    Following a similar process, no triangles are found with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph [1 triangle found with Node 7]: [1]
* Unique triangles: <14, 17, 7>
