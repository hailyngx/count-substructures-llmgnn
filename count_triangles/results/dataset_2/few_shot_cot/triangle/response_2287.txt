Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (8, 11) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (8, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (13, 4) -> 13 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because there is no edge connecting 13 and 4. No triangle formed.
