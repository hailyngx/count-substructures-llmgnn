Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
