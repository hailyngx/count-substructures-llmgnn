Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (8, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (8, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (10, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (6, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (0, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (0, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (7, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

We need to continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to find all the triangles. Let's calculate the total number of triangles once all nodes have been processed.
