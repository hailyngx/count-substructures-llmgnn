Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 0 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs that include nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 2 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 7 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * There aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
