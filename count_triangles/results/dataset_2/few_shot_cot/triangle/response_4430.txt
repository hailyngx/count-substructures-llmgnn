Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are not connected as there is no edge (4, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are not connected as there is no edge (9, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 8 and 16 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 16) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are not connected as there is no edge (16, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 16 and 19 are not directly connected as there is no edge (16, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 11 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 10 and 19 are not directly connected as there is no edge (10, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
