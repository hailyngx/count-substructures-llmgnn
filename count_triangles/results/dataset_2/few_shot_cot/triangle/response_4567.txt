Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the process from the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as all possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node have already been counted.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as all possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node have already been counted.

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as all possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node have already been counted.

* Node 7:
    * Skipped as all possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node have already been counted.

* Node 8:
    * Skipped as all possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest node have already been counted.

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as all possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest node have already been counted.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
