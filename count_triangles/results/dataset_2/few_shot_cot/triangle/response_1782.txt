* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Triangle <0, 4, 14>
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (14, 13) -> No triangle formed.
