Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - <9, 13, 0> is a triangle as all three nodes are connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - <4, 12, 1> is a triangle as all three nodes are connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - <10, 14, 2> is a triangle as all three nodes are connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - <12, 1, 4> is a triangle as all three nodes are connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - <3, 5, 11> is a triangle as all three nodes are connected to each other.
    - <6, 2, 13> is a triangle as all three nodes are connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - <11, 9, 13> is a triangle as all three nodes are connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    - <5, 3, 11> is a triangle as all three nodes are connected to each other.
    - <11, 9, 13> is a triangle as all three nodes are connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 12:
    - <1, 9, 12> is a triangle as all three nodes are connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1
