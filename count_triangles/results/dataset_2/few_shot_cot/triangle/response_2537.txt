Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 9, 8, 5, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 5, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process detailed in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Node 3 and Node 8 are connected through Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Node 5 and Node 8 are connected through Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Node 0 and Node 4 are connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> Node 0 and Node 9 are connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
