Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Ignored as 1 is greater than 0.
        * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Ignored as 4 is greater than 0.
        * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> Ignored as 7 is greater than 0.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Ignored as 0 is smaller than 1.
        * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> Ignored as 0 is smaller than 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Ignored because there are no pairs with nodes greater than 2.

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Ignored as 8 is smaller than 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 10:
        * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Ignored as 11 is smaller than 10.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 11:
        * Pair 1: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 12:
        * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Ignored as 7 is smaller than 12.
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 13:
        * Ignored because there are no pairs with nodes greater than 13.

    * Node 14:
        * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Ignored as 1 is smaller than 14.
        * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> Ignored as 1 is smaller than 14.
        * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles found in the graph are: [<7, 8, 13>, <8, 9, 13>, <9, 12, 13>].

The final answer is [3].
