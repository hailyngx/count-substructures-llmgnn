Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4, 5, and 6:
        * Skipped as they are smaller than 8 and already counted in previous nodes.

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 8:
        * Skipped as it is smaller than Nodes 13 and 14.

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 10:
        * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 11:
        * Skipped as it is smaller than Node 13.

    * Node 12:
        * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 13:
        * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 14:
        * Skipped as it doesn't have nodes greater than itself to form triangles with.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) = 10.

    Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
