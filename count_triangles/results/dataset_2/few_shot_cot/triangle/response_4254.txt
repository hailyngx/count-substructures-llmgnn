Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as explained in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 because it's smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
