Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 1, 2, 3.
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 2, 3.
    - Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 6.
    - Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:

* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 1 triangle
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 1 triangle

Calculating the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles for each node:
Total triangles = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1
Total triangles = 7

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
