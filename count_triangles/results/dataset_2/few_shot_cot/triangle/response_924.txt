Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle <0, 6, 9>
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (0, 18) -> Triangle <0, 3, 18>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> Triangle <3, 5, 19>
    * Pair 2: (3, 16) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (3, 18) -> Triangle <3, 0, 18>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 16) -> Triangle <1, 8, 16>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Triangle <0, 6, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (14, 11) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (10, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (17, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (18, 17) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (10, 8) -> Triangle <8, 10, 16>
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 7

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
