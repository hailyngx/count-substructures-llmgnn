Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 26) -> 2 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (18, 26) -> 18 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 18) -> Same as for Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (1, 26) -> Same as for Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (14, 1) -> 14 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skipped as it is connected to Node 26 which is smaller in number.

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as it is connected to Nodes 3 and 15 which are smaller in number.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as it is connected to Nodes 8, 14, and 12 which are all smaller in number.

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as it is connected to Nodes 11, 17, and 25 which are all smaller in number.

* Node 7:
    * Skipped as it is connected to Nodes 5, 12, and 22 which are all smaller in number.

* Node 8:
    * Skipped as it is connected to Nodes 0, 5, and 10 which are all smaller in number.

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as it is connected to Nodes 3 and 24 which are both smaller in number.

* Node 10:
    * Skipped as it is connected to Nodes 8, 22, 21, and 28 which are all smaller in number.

* Node 11:
    * Skipped as it is connected to Nodes 6 and 15 which are both smaller in number.

* Node 12:
    * Skipped as it is connected to Nodes 7, 5, and 13 which are all smaller in number.

* Node 13:
    * Skipped as it is connected to Nodes 3, 20, 24, and 12 which are all smaller in number.

* Node 14:
    * Skipped as it is connected to Nodes 2, 0, 5, and 19 which are all smaller in number.

* Node 15:
    * Skipped as it is connected to Nodes 11, 4, 21, and 17 which are all smaller in number.

Continuing this process for all remaining nodes, we find the total number of triangles in the given graph to be [9]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 2, 18>

<2, 14, 18>
<2, 14, 1>
<5, 8, 10>
<5, 8, 12>
