Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skipping any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skipping any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangle can be formed using Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5 to 9:
    * For Nodes 5 to 9, no triangles can be formed with any combination of three nodes that are greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<3, 4, 6>, 
<1, 2, 8>. 


Therefore, the final answer is [7].
