Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 20) -> 3 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (20, 11) -> 20 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (19, 27) -> 19 and 27 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 11) -> 19 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (27, 11) -> 27 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 22) -> 13 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 26) -> 15 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Similar to Node 6, no triangle can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (8, 24) -> 8 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 29) -> 8 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (24, 29) -> 24 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 11 - 29:
    * Skip the remaining nodes as they've all been covered before.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
