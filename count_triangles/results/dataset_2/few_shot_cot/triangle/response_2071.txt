Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the previous example, we can count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 1) -> 13 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2
* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

Thus, the answer is [7].
