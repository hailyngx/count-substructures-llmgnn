Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (5, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes smaller than 1. No triangles to count.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> Both 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) -> Both 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 4) -> Both 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 4) -> Both 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (8, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (8, 7) -> Both 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (8, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (4, 3) -> Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (9, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 2) -> Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes included. No triangles to count.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes included. No triangles to count.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes included. No triangles to count.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes included. No triangles to count.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip because they don't have at least two other nodes with higher values to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
