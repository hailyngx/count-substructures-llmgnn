This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1)

Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph based on the adjacency list and edges provided:

- Node 0:
   - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not a triangle.
   - Pair 2: (5, 1) -> Not a triangle.
   - Pair 3: (9, 1) -> Not a triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
   - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 2 are also connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
   - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
   - Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
   - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
   - Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
