Response:
I will now calculate the number of triangles in this graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node and following the steps provided in the example.

* Node 0:
    * Skip because Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.

* Node 1:
    * Skip because there is only one connection for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) - nodes 17 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip because Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (17, 20) - nodes 17 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - nodes 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 28) - nodes 9 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 28) - nodes 14 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (14, 29) - nodes 14 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 20) - nodes 7 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 24) - nodes 7 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 24) - nodes 20 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip because there are fewer than 2 connections for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - nodes 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 19) - nodes 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 19) - nodes 14 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Let's continue this process for the remaining nodes.
