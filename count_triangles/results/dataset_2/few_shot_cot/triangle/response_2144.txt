Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 9.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 9.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 14.
    * Pair 4: (0, 12) -> Not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 14) -> Not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 11.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 13.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 10.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 9.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 10.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 10.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 11.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 9.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 13.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 10.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 9.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 6, 7, and 8 don't have enough nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with the existing connections.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Connected in the graph, forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with the existing connections.
   
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6, 7, 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 13) = 21

Therefore, there are a total of 21 triangles in the given graph.
