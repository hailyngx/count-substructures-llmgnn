Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
