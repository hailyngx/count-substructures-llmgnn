Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles formed in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs: No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no pairs of 2-hop neighbors directly connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs: No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no pairs of 2-hop neighbors directly connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pairs: No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no pairs of 2-hop neighbors directly connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pairs: No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no pairs of 2-hop neighbors directly connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<9, 1, 5>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
