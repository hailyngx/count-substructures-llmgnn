Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the example provided, we can now determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 19: <1, 5, 9>
    - Pair 2: (1, 19) -> Node 1, 19, and 5 are connected: <1, 5, 19>
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (9, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 11: <2, 9, 15>
    - Pair 2: (2, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 13: <2, 11, 13>
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Node 5, 14, and 16 are connected: <5, 14, 16>
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (9, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <9, 15, 2>
    - Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Node 1, 9, and 5 are connected: <1, 5, 9>
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Node 13, 12, and 11 are connected: <11, 12, 13>
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    - Pair 1: (18, 15) -> Node 15, 18, and 17 are connected: <15, 17, 18>
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:
    - Pair 1: (19, 1) -> Node 1, 19, and 5 are connected: <1, 5, 19>
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: <1, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 19>, <2, 9, 15>, <2, 11, 13>, <5, 14, 16>, <11, 12, 13>, <15, 17, 18>, and <1, 5, 19>. 

Thus, the final answer is [10].
