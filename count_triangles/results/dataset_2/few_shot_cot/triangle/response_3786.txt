Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed as all its 1-hop neighbors are smaller.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (12, 9) -> 12 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed as all its 1-hop neighbors are smaller.

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (12, 7) -> 12 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed as all its 1-hop neighbors are smaller.

* Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed as all its 1-hop neighbors are smaller.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 2 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
