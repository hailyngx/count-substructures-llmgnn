Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Nodes 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Nodes 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - Nodes 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Nodes 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of node 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - Nodes 4 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - Nodes 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of node 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Nodes 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of node 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Nodes 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of node 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) - Nodes 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of node 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Nodes 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - Nodes 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of node 7, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) - Nodes 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of node 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) - Nodes 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of node 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].

The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <4, 2, 8>, <6, 3, 9>, and <5, 6, 7>.
