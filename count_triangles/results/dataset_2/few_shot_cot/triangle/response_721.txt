Response:
Following the same procedure as shown in the initial example, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 10 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with nodes of higher numbers.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
