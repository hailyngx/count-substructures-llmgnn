Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1)

Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the example explained earlier, let's count the number of triangles in this graph by examining each node step by step:

1. Node 0:
   - Pair 1: (1, 2) - Form a triangle <0, 1, 2>

2. Node 1:
   - Pair 1: (4, 8) - Form a triangle <1, 4, 8>
   - Pair 2: (2, 9) - Form a triangle <1, 2, 9>

3. Node 2:
   - Pair 1: (0, 3) - Form a triangle <0, 2, 3>
   - Pair 2: (1, 4) - Form a triangle <1, 2, 4>
   - Pair 3: (3, 6) - Form a triangle <2, 3, 6>

4. Node 3:
   - Pair 1: (6, 9) - Form a triangle <3, 6, 9>

5. Node 4:
   - Pair 1: (1, 8) - Form a triangle <1, 4, 8>
   - Pair 2: (6, 8) - No triangle formed

6. Node 5:
   - No triangles can be formed.

7. Node 6:
   - No triangles can be formed.

8. Node 7:
   - No triangles can be formed.

9. Node 8:
   - Pair 1: (0, 9) - Form a triangle <0, 8, 9>
   - Pair 2: (1, 4) - Form a triangle <1, 4, 8>

10. Node 9:
   - Pair 1: (5, 1) - Form a triangle <1, 5, 9>
   - Pair 2: (1, 3) - No triangle formed
   - Pair 3: (1, 4) - Form a triangle <1, 4, 9>
   - Pair 4: (3, 6) - Form a triangle <3, 6, 9>
   - Pair 5: (1, 8) - Form a triangle <1, 8, 9>

Calculating the total number of triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 5 (Node 9) = 16

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
