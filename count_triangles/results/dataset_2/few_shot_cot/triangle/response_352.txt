This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 2 and node 4.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Node 2 and node 9 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 4 and node 9.
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) -> Node 0 and node 9 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    Unique Triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 9>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with node 4 and node 6.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> Node 7 and node 1 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique Triangle: <1, 4, 6>

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 5 and node 8.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 2, 4, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    Unique Triangles: <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 8>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 5, 9, and 3.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Node 3 and node 7 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique Triangle: <3, 5, 9>

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 4, 8, and 2.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 4, 9, and 5.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> Triangle formed with node 4, 0, and 9.
    * Pair 4: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 1, 4, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4
    Unique Triangles: <1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 0, 9>

The nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not have enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) = 10

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
