Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
