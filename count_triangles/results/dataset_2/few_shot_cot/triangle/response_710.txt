Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each of the 20 nodes in the graph provided, we will calculate the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> Neither (2, 15) nor (15, 2) are in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 18) -> Both 2 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 12) -> Both 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 12) -> Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 15) -> Both 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 15) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Neither (3, 9) nor (9, 3) are in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (1, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
