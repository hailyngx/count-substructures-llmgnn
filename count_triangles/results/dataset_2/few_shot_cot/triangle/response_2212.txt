Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided for each node in the graph given:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are directly connected as (0, 2) in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as (3, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are directly connected as (3, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are directly connected as (1, 2) in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 3 are directly connected as (1, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are directly connected as (1, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
    * Remaining nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
        * Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than each to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. 

The unique triangles found are: <4, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>.
