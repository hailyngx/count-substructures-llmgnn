Response:
Following the step-by-step triangle counting process for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
