Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (7, 3). 
    * Pair 5: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 11).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (17, 7) -> 17 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Do not consider pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 due to their smaller values.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (16, 11) -> 16 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (19, 11) -> 19 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (19, 11).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (19, 13) -> 19 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (19, 13).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

The process will continue for Nodes 6 to 19. Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.
