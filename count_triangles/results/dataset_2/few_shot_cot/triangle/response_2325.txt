Response:
Following the same method as the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (1, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (2, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (2, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (4, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (0, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (0, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (6, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Adding up the triangles from each node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
