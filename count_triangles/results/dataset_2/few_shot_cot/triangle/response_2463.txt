Response:
Following the same process as the example provided earlier, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 11 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 24) -> 3 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 4 and 17 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (29, 5) -> 29 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 29 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (29, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 5) -> 18 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 18 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> Already counted in the triangle count for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Already counted in the triangle count for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (25, 8) -> 25 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 25 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (29, 8) -> 29 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 29 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: No pairs can be made for Node 9 as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 29:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than these numbers.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
