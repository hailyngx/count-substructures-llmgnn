Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the first example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> Node 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as (9, 14). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> Node 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Node 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected as (5, 13). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> Node 5 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 11) -> Node 13 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Node 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> Node 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> Node 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected as (5, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) -> Node 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected as (6, 10). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Node 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected as (9, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> Node 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> Node 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes < 4.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes < 5.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes < 6.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes < 9.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes < 10.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes < 11.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes < 12.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

14. Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes < 14.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Calculating the total number of triangles by adding the triangles found for each node:

Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 6

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
