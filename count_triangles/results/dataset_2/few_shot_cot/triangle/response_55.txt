Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected in the edge list, no triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (0, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (3, 13) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (5, 13) in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    - Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list, no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Already counted above, no new triangle.
    - Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (2, 11) in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (3, 13) -> Already counted above, no new triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (6, 12) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Already counted above, no new triangle.
    - Pair 2: (1, 13) -> No new triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Perform the same for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Then count the total number of triangles. 

[Result: 27]
