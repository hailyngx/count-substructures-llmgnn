Response:
Following the method shown in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Many pairs can be made, continue pairing while Node 2 is the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 6>
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed: <2, 6, 7>
    * Pair 5: (6, 12) -> Triangle formed: <2, 6, 12>
    * Pair 6: (7, 12) -> Triangle formed: <2, 7, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Continue pairing while Node 3 is the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> Triangle formed: <3, 7, 11>
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) -> Triangle formed: <3, 7, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Continue pairing while Node 4 is the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Triangle formed: <4, 8, 10>
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> Triangle formed: <4, 8, 11>
    * Pair 4: (8, 6) -> Triangle formed: <4, 8, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Continue pairing while Node 5 is the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 6>
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Continue pairing while Node 6 is the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Continue pairing while Node 7 is the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> Triangle formed: <7, 9, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Continue pairing while Node 8 is the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    Each node individually does not form any triangles as the process of finding triangles already covered all possible combinations.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) +  0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
