Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- For Node 0:
    - <5, 7, 9> forms a triangle as 5, 7, and 9 are all connected to node 0.
    - No other triangles involving Node 0.

- For Node 1:
    - No triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node.

- For Node 2:
    - No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node.

- For Node 3:
    - No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node.

- For Node 4:
    - <6, 7, 4> forms a triangle as 6, 7, and 4 are all connected to each other.
    - No other triangles involving Node 4.

- For Node 5:
    - <0, 8, 5> forms a triangle as 0, 8, and 5 are all connected to node 5.
    - No other triangles involving Node 5.

- For Node 6:
    - No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node.

- For Node 7:
    - No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node.

- For Node 8:
    - No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest node.

- For Node 9:
    - No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest node.

- For Node 10:
    - No triangles with Node 10 as the smallest node.

- For Node 11:
    - No triangles with Node 11 as the smallest node.

- For Node 12:
    - No triangles with Node 12 as the smallest node.

- For Node 13:
    - <0, 4, 13> forms a triangle as 0, 4, and 13 are all connected to each other.
    - No other triangles involving Node 13.

- For Node 14:
    - No triangles with Node 14 as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 triangles from Node 0 + 1 triangle from Node 4 + 1 triangle from Node 5 + 1 triangle from Node 13 = 5 triangles.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
