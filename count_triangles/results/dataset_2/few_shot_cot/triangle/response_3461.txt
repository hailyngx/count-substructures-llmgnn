Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (0, 4) -> Node 0, 4 and 6 form a triangle <0, 4, 6>.
    - Pair 6: (0, 2) -> Node 0, 2 and 8 form a triangle <0, 2, 8>.
    - Pair 7: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 0.
    - Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Node 0, 4 and 7 form a triangle <0, 4, 7>.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 4.
    - Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
