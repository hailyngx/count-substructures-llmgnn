Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, 5, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's possible triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Triangle formed with nodes 1 and 4.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) - Triangle formed with nodes 4 and 6.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) - Triangle formed with nodes 4 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - Triangle formed with nodes 4 and 7.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) - Triangle formed with nodes 4 and 0.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - Triangle formed with nodes 4 and 7.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) - Triangle formed with nodes 4 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) - Triangle formed with nodes 1 and 7.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No new triangles can be formed as all possible pairs have been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No new triangles can be formed as all possible pairs have been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No new triangles can be formed as all possible pairs have been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No new triangles can be formed as all possible pairs have been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed as all possible pairs have been covered.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
