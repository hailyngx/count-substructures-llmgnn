Response:
Following the given instructions, we will count the triangles formed by each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs involving nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs involving nodes smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there are no larger nodes to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 unique triangles in the given graph.
