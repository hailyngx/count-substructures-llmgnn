Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 3) -> 11 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip node 0 as it is smaller than node 1.
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for nodes 6 to 19 as demonstrated above.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: [12]

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
