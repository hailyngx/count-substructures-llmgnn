Response:
Following the previous example, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 9 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 11) -> Both 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 11 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 11) -> Both 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 9 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 9 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> Both 11 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 11 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are <4, 11, 6>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 4, 1>, <4, 3, 0>, <7, 13, 3>, <4, 12, 2>, and <5, 12, 2>.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
