Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph by following the same step-by-step process as before for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 8.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> Triangle formed with node 14.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> Triangle formed with node 11.
    * Pair 4: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed since 8 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (8, 11) -> No triangle formed since 8 and 11 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (14, 11) -> Triangle formed with node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 4.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> Triangle formed with node 11.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> Triangle formed with node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 since they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> Triangle formed with node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11 and Node 12:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 13:
    * Skip, only connected to Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 14) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
