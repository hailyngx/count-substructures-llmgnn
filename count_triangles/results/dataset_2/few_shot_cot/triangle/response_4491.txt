Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or Node 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No connected triangles for node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing to Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to lack of necessary nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 5 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
