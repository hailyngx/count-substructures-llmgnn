Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 5>, <3, 6, 11>, and <4, 5, 10>.
