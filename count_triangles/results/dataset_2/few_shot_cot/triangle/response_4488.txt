Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7 and Node 8:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7 or 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found:
<1, 2, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
