Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest node.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest node.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles: 
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 6) + 0 + 1 (Node 8) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 16) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

[<1, 3, 4>, <6, 9, 12>, <8, 11, 17>]
