Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> Triangle Formed: <0, 1, 4>
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> Triangle Formed: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> Triangle Formed: <0, 3, 4>
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) -> Triangle Formed: <0, 1, 2>
    * Pair 5: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 3) -> Triangle Formed: <0, 2, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle Formed: <1, 4, 8>
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Triangle Formed: <1, 2, 4>
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> Triangle Formed: <1, 3, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Triangle Formed: <2, 3, 9>
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Triangle Formed: <1, 2, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle Formed: <4, 5, 8>
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Triangle Formed: <4, 6, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle Formed: <5, 6, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
