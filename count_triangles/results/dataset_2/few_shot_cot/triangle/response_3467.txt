Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are skipped as they connect with smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 as they are smaller. Skip any pairs with nodes 10 and 17 as they are larger.
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) - Both 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) - Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (10, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9, 14, and 15 are skipped due to similar reasons.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) - Both 6 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 11, 16, 17, and 19 are skipped due to similar reasons.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 13 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) - Both 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) - Both 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14, 15, and 18 are skipped due to similar reasons.

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 1, 2, and 19 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) - Both 16 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 5, 6, 15, and 19 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

Therefore, the count of triangles for each node is as follows:
Node 0: 3
Node 8: 1
Node 10: 1
Node 12: 1
Node 13: 1
Node 16: 1
Node 18: 0

Adding up the individual counts, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].

The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <8, 0, 10>, <10, 6, 17>, <12, 4, 13>, <13, 0, 6>, and <16, 16, 19>.
