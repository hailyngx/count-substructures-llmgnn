Response:
Following the same method as before to count triangles:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 6>.
        * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 3: (6, 8) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 8>
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 6, 7>.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>.
        * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 9>.
        * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 4: (3, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 6>.
        * Pair 6: (4, 9) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed:  <4, 6, 9>.
        * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 8>.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 4

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 7, 9>.
        * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

    Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 4 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

    Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
