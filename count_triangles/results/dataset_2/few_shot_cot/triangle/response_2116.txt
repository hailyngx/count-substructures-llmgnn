Response:
Following the process described in the example using the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
