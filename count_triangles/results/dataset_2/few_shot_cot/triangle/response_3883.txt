Response:
Following the step-by-step process to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 21) -> Both 7 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 23) -> 7 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (21, 9) -> Both 21 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (21, 18) -> Both 21 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (21, 23) -> 21 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (9, 23) -> 9 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (18, 23) -> 18 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for all nodes in the graph and calculate the total number of triangles at the end. Remember to skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes and only consider pairs that can form triangles.

Once you have completed the process for all nodes, please provide the final answer inside brackets [].
