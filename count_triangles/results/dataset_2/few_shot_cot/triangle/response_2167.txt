Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles found with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 3 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * No triangles found with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 8.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 5.
* The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 13>, <2, 3, 8>, and <5, 1, 3>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
