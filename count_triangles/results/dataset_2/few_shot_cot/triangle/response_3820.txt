Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14: <0, 2, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12: <2, 7, 12>
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 2, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12: <0, 3, 12>
    * Pair 2: (0, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 3, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than the node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
