Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (1, 14) is not in the 1-hop neighbor list of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (12, 14) is not in the 1-hop neighbor list of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (5, 13) is not in the 1-hop neighbor list of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (4, 10) is not in the 1-hop neighbor list of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (6, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 because (4, 13) is not in the 1-hop neighbor list of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 following the same steps.

Finally, sum up the total triangles for each node to get the total number of triangles in the graph.

When you complete the process, please provide the final answer inside brackets []. Let's find the number of triangles in this graph!
