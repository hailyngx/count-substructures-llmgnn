Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
   * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
   * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> The nodes 4 and 7 are directly connected. But they have no common neighbor for a triangle.
   * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> The nodes 4 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> The nodes 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> The nodes 4 and 2 are directly connected. But they have no common neighbor for a triangle.
   * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
   * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> The nodes 9 and 14 are directly connected. But they have no common neighbor for a triangle.
   * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
   * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> The nodes 4 and 9 are directly connected. They share Node 3 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>.

* Node 4:
   * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, as they are smaller than 4.
   * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> The nodes 7 and 10 are directly connected. No common neighbor for a triangle.
   * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> The nodes 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> The nodes 7 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> The nodes 7 and 1 are directly connected. But they have no common neighbor for a triangle.

   * Pair 7: (10, 1) -> The nodes 10 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 8: (11, 9) -> The nodes 11 and 9 are directly connected. No common neighbor for a triangle.
   * Pair 9: (11, 8) -> The nodes 11 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

   * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles from all nodes:

[<3, 4, 9>] = 1

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
