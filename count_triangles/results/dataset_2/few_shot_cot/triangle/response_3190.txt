Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7 and Node 8:
    * Skipped, as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7 or 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
