Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 1>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 11>.
    * Pair 5: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 4>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 10>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 8>.
    * Pair 4: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <5, 6, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 would give the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed with the calculations.
