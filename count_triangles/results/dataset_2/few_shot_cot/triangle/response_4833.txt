Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) - No edge between 4 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 15) - No edge between 4 and 15. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 19) - 4 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 15) - No edge between 12 and 15. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 19) - Nodes 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (15, 19) - Nodes 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1: (Similar to the process shown above for each pair)
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * They all have a degree less than 2, so there won't be any triangles involving these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
