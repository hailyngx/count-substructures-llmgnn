* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 4) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (6, 2) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (6, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 2) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 11: (4, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (4, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (2, 8) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 14: (2, 7) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 15: (8, 7) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 8

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (6, 7) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (2, 8) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (2, 7) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (2, 4) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 11: (8, 7) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 12: (8, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (8, 0) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (7, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (7, 0) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 10

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 8 (Node 0) + 10 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 21.

Therefore, there are 21 triangles in the given graph.
