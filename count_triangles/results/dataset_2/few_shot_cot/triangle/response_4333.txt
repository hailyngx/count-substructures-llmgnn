Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. No third node connected to both 4 and 19. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No third node connected to both 3 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. No third node connected to both 3 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. No third node connected to both 5 and 16. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. No third node connected to both 11 and 15. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. No third node connected to both 10 and 13. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 are skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than or equal to any of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
