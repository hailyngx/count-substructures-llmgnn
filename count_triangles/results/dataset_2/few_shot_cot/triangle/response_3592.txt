Response:
Following the same approach as described in the example, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 6) - Both 12 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) - Both 14 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 10 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No triangles formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 11 as they are smaller than 11.
    * No triangles formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 12 as they are smaller than 12.
    * No triangles formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 13 as they are smaller than 13.
    * No triangles formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (19, 15) - Both 19 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 15 as they are smaller than 15.
    * No triangles formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 16 as they are smaller than 16.
    * No triangles formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 17 as they are smaller than 17.
    * No triangles formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 18 as they are smaller than 18.
    * No triangles formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 19 as they are smaller than 19.
    * No triangles formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
