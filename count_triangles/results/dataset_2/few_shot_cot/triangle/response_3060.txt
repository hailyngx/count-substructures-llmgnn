Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the given example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph you provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs possible for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No valid pairs for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No valid pairs for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No valid pairs for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No valid pairs for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 4 and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 4, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 9. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
