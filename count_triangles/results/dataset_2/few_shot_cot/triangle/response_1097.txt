Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided with all the necessary lists and information given for the graph provided:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Connected, since (5, 3) is in the edge list. One triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (7, 3) -> Connected, since (7, 3) is in the edge list. One triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Connected, since (9, 4) is in the edge list. One triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Connected, since (4, 8) is in the edge list. One triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (4, 0) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (4, 3) -> Connected, since (4, 3) is in the edge list. One triangle formed.
            * Pair 7: (8, 0) -> Connected, since (8, 0) is in the edge list. One triangle formed.
            * Pair 8: (8, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 9: (0, 3) -> Connected, since (0, 3) is in the edge list. One triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Connected, since (5, 4) is in the edge list. One triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Connected, since (5, 7) is in the edge list. One triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Connected, since (5, 6) is in the edge list. One triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Connected, since (4, 7) is in the edge list. One triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> Connected, since (4, 6) is in the edge list. One triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (7, 6) -> Connected, since (7, 6) is in the edge list. One triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 6

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Continuing with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
            * All these nodes do not form triangles with any other nodes due to their connections and the existing triangles already counted above.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 6 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13.

        Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
