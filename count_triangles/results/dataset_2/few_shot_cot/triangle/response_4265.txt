Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 15) -> Both 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 15) -> Both 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 15>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 18) -> 0 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) -> 0 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 15 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 15) -> 17 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 17 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Let's continue this process for the remaining nodes to find all the triangles.
