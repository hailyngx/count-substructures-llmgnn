Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 2 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * No triangles are formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19)
* Total triangles in the given graph: 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the graph. The unique triangles are <4, 7, 14> and <2, 4, 14>.

So, the output is: [2].
