Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected although they are 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are not directly connected although they are 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not directly connected although they are 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing the process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 yields no additional triangles based on the given information.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
