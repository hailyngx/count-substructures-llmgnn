Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the process described in the example provided, we will compute the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with node 4 and node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 2 and node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No new triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with node 4 and node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with node 6 and node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No new triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No new triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No new triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No new triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
