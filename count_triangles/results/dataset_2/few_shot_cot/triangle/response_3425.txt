Response:
Following the example provided earlier, we will now find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> Connected
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Connected
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> Connected
    * Pair 4: (10, 8) -> Skipped (8 < 10)
    * Pair 5: (10, 12) -> Not connected
    * Pair 6: (10, 11) -> Not connected
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Connected
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Connected
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> Not connected
    * Pair 4: (9, 11) -> Not connected
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Connected
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Connected
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> Not connected
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> Connected
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Connected
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> Not connected
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Connected
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as they have no pairs to consider where both nodes are greater.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
