    - No triangles found with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. **Node 3:**
    - No triangles found with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. **Node 4:**
    - <4, 15, 18> is a triangle as all nodes are connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5:**
    - No triangles found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6:**

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
