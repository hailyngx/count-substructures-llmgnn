Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) - Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (13, 15) - Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - Form a triangle <6, 8, 0>.
    * Pair 4: (6, 15) - Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (8, 15) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) - Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (10, 16) - Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 16) - Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 18) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Form a triangle <5, 8, 2>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) - Form a triangle <15, 17, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 19) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 16) - Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 18) - Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (13, 18) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) - Form a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12 skipped as they are not part of any triangle.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) - Form a triangle <14, 18, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) - Form a triangle <16, 18, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) - Form a triangle <0, 4, 15>.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
