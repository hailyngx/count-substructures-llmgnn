Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and 9 and 7 are connected as (9, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors, and 6 and 3 are connected as (6, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors, and 3 and 4 are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors, and 9 and 0 are connected as (9, 0) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
