Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, we will count the triangles step-by-step while considering each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as (10, 15) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 15 and 18 are also connected as (15, 18) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 11 as they are not directly connected or adjacent. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 15, 18>
<4, 7, 18>
<12, 13, 17>

So, the final answer is [3].
