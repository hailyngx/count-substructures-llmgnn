Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example with the given graph, here is the breakdown for finding the triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 12) shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (10, 12) shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (8, 10) shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (10, 12) shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (9, 14) shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Skip 1-hop neighbor sets that contain smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip 1-hop neighbor sets that contain smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 10:
        * Skip 1-hop neighbor sets that contain smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 11:
        * Skip 1-hop neighbor sets that contain smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 12:
        * Skip 1-hop neighbor sets that contain smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 13:
        * Skip 1-hop neighbor sets that contain smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 14:
        * Skip 1-hop neighbor sets that contain smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
