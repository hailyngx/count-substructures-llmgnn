Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 4 and 14:
        -> Node 17 is not a neighbor of 14.
        No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 8 and 14:
        -> Node 1 is not a neighbor of 8.
        No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 7) -> 12 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * No pair to consider, all potential neighbors are smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 10:
    * No pair to consider, all potential neighbors are smaller than 10.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 11. No triangles formed.

* Node 12:
    * No pair to consider, all potential neighbors are smaller than 12.

* Node 13:
    * No pair to consider, all potential neighbors are smaller than 13.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 14. No triangles formed.

* Node 15:
    * No pair to consider, all potential neighbors are smaller than 15.

* Node 16:
    * No pair to consider, all potential neighbors are smaller than 16.

* Node 17:
    * No pair to consider, all potential neighbors are smaller than 17.

* Node 18:
    * No pair to consider, all potential neighbors are smaller than 18.

* Node 19:
    * No pair to consider, all potential neighbors are smaller than 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
