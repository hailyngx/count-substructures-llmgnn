Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 21) -> Both 1 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> Both 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> Both 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (21, 11) -> Both 21 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (21, 12) -> Both 21 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 12) -> Both 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for all nodes in the given graph:

* Node 2 - Total triangles: 2
* Node 3 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 4 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 5 - Total triangles: 1
* Node 6 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 7 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 8 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 9 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 10 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 11 - Total triangles: 2
* Node 12 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 13 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 14 - Total triangles: 1
* Node 15 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 16 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 17 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 18 - Total triangles: 4
* Node 19 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 20 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 21 - Total triangles: 1
* Node 22 - Total triangles: 2
* Node 23 - Total triangles: 1
* Node 24 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 25 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 26 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 27 - Total triangles: 0
* Node 28 - Total triangles: 1
* Node 29 - Total triangles: 1

Summarizing the triangles: 
[<0, 12, 1>, <2, 15, 9>, <2, 15, 24>, <5, 11, 29>, <18, 6, 28>, <18, 6, 21>, <18, 6, 16>, <21, 13, 28>, <22, 10, 17>, <22, 10, 7>, <23, 4, 27>] 

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph.
