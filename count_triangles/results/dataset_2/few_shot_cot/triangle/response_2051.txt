Response:
Following the method explained in the example, we will proceed step-by-step to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, and 4 and 8 are also 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected, and 4 and 5 are also 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are connected, but 4 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are connected, but 8 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are connected, but 8 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected, but 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 3 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected, and 5 and 7 are also 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected, but 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 3 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected, but 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 3 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 5, 6, or 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
