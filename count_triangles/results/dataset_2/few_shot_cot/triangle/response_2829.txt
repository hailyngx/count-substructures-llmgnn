Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 1) -> This pair was already considered in Pair 2.
    * Pair 5: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 2 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 2 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 4 are connected as (6, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 9 and 0 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 7 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> This pair was already considered in Pair 3.
    * Pair 6: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 8 and 0 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 2 are connected as (6, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * All these nodes have at least two larger nodes to consider for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
