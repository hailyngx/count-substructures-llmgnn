Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - <0, 5, 9> : 0 and 5 are connected, 0 and 9 are connected, and 5 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - <0, 5, 3> : 0 and 5 are connected, 0 and 3 are connected, but 5 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - <0, 9, 4> : 0 and 9 are connected, 0 and 4 are connected, but 9 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - <0, 6, 4> : 0 and 6 are connected, 0 and 4 are connected, but 6 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - <1, 5, 3> : 1 and 5 are connected, 1 and 3 are connected, but 5 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - <1, 5, 6> : 1 and 5 are connected, 1 and 6 are connected, but 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - <1, 3, 2> : 1 and 3 are connected, 1 and 2 are connected, but 3 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - <2, 4, 5> : 2 and 4 are connected, 2 and 5 are connected, but 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - <4, 9, 5> : 4 and 9 are connected, 4 and 5 are connected, but 9 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - <4, 6, 1> : 4 and 6 are connected, 4 and 1 are connected, but 6 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - <4, 8, 5> : 4 and 8 are connected, 4 and 5 are connected, and 8 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
