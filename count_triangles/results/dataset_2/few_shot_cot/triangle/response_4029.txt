Response:
Following the previous step-by-step approach to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * <2, 13, 0>
    * <2, 17, 0>
    * <2, 29, 11>
    * <13, 17, 0>
    * <17, 3, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.
