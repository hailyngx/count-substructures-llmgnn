Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's 1-hop neighbor set and finding the triangles involving that node. 

Here is the step-by-step approach for counting triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0:
   - No triangle can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

2. Node 1:
   - No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. Node 2:
   - No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. Node 3:
   - Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. (1, 7, 3) form a triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
   - No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. Node 5:
   - No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. Node 6:
   - No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
   - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. (1, 3, 7) form a triangle.
   - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. (2, 7, 12) form a triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

9. Node 8:
   - No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected. (3, 12, 10) form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

12. Node 11:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected. (3, 7, 12) form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

14. Node 13:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. Node 14:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
