Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 0 are also directly connected as (4, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 2 are also directly connected as (4, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 3 are also directly connected as (9, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 4 are also directly connected as (0, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2, which are smaller.
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 2, which are smaller.
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2, which are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 0 and 8 are also directly connected as (0, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 4, which are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
