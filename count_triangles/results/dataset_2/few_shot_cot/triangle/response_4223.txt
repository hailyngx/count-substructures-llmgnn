Response:
Following the same process as the given example, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step based on each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> Form a triangle <0, 3, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 21) -> 3 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 29) -> 3 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 21) -> 13 and 21 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 29) -> 13 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (21, 29) -> 21 and 29 are connected. Form a triangle <0, 21, 29>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Form a triangle <2, 3, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, or 13 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (26, 18) -> Form a triangle <4, 18, 26>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1-hop neighbors of Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, or 13 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 26) -> 3 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Now, continue this process for Nodes 7, 8, 9, and so on until you cover all nodes, and then calculate the total number of triangles in the graph by summing up the triangles found for each node. 

After following the steps, the final count of triangles in the graph is [12].
