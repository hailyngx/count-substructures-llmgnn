Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, here is the breakdown of counting triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 0 because it has only two neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 because it has only two neighbors.
    
* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are not connected because (6, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 14) -> 17 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 17 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (17, 5) -> 17 and 5 are not connected because (17, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 11 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 because it has only two neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 because it has only three neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 because it has only two neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 2 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 16) -> 17 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 17 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 because it has only three neighbors.

* Node 10:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 10 because it has only two neighbors.

* Node 11:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 11 because it has only three neighbors.

* Node 12:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 12 because it has only one neighbor.

* Node 13:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 13 because it has only two neighbors.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 15 because it has only two neighbors.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 16, and 8 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 17 because it has only four neighbors.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 18, and 8 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 18, and 16 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 19:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 19 because it has only three neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 2 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
