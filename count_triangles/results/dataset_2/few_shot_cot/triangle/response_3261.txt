Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided for counting triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 11 are directly connected. 
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 4: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skip pairs involving these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
