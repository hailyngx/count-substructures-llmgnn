Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to no suitable pairs for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
