Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are connected, and 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 10: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - No triangle can be formed as none of the pairs have both neighboring nodes connected.

3. Node 2:
    - No triangle can be formed as there are not enough connected neighboring pairs.

4. Node 3:
    - No triangle can be formed for the same reason as Node 2.

5. Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed as none of the pairs have both neighboring nodes connected.

6. Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 5. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Node 6:
    - No triangle can be formed as there are not enough connected neighboring pairs.

8. Node 7:
    - No triangle can be formed as there are not enough connected neighboring pairs.

9. Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed based on the available connections.

Continuing this process for Nodes 9 to 19:

10. Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (16, 12) -> 16 and 12 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 9. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. Node 10:
    - No triangle can be formed as there are not enough connected neighboring pairs.

12. Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed based on the available connections.

13. Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (16, 10) -> 16 and 10 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 12. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

14. Node 13:
    - No triangle can be formed as there are not enough connected neighboring pairs.

15. Node 14:
    - No triangle can be formed as there are not enough connected neighboring pairs.

16. Node 15:
    - No triangle can be formed as there are not enough connected neighboring pairs.

17. Node 16:
    - No triangles can be formed based on the available connections.

18. Node 17:
    - No triangle can be formed as there are not enough connected neighboring pairs.

19. Node 18:
    - Pair 1: (16, 10) -> 16 and 10 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 18. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

20. Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed based on the available connections.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 18) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
