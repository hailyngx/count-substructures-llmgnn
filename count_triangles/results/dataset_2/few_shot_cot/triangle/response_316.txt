    * Pair 5: (6, 0) - Node 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (6, 0) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) - Node 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (6, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (6, 3) - Node 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (6, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) - Node 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (4, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (4, 3) - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (8, 3) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (6, 0) - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - Node 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (9, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) - No triangle formed

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
