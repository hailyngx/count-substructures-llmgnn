Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example given, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (21, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (25, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (27, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (22, 23) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (23, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (19, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (29, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (25, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (18, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No pairs to check. No other nodes to form a triangle with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (14, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (21, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (21, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 16 to 30:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 16 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
