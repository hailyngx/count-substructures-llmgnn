Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example provided, let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected as (5, 10) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are connected as (10, 17) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected as (8, 18) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No edges connected to Node 2, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected as (11, 16) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected as (11, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected as (16, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are connected as (17, 19) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Both 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and connected as (10, 13) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and connected as (9, 13) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> Same triangle counted previously (as Node 3 was the smallest numbered node with this pair).

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> Same triangle counted previously (as Node 1 was the smallest numbered node with this pair).

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Both 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 and are connected as (6, 13) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Same triangle counted previously (as Node 5 was the smallest numbered node with this pair).

* Node 11:
    * Same triangles counted previously as Node 3 was the smallest numbered node with these pairs.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * Same triangles counted previously as Node 5 and Node 6 were the smallest numbered nodes with these pairs.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 14 and are connected as (7, 19) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * Same triangles counted previously as Node 3 was the smallest numbered node with these pairs.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * Same triangles counted previously as Node 1 was the smallest numbered node with these pairs.

* Node 19:
    * Same triangles counted previously as Node 4 and Node 14 were the smallest numbered nodes with these pairs.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
