Following the same process as described in the example for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 1, 3, 8 as they're smaller.
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are directly connected. 
    * Pair 2: (0, 29) -> 0 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
