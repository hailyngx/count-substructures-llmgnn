Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 0) and (4, 0). Triangle <1, 0, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 0) and (13, 0). Triangle <1, 0, 13>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 0) and (13, 0). Triangle <4, 0, 13>.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
