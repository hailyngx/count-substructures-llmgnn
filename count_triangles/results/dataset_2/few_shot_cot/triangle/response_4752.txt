Response:
Following the step-by-step method described in the example using the provided graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are directly connected. 
        * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
        * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected.
        * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are directly connected.
        * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are directly connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are directly connected.
        * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are directly connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
        * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are directly connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
