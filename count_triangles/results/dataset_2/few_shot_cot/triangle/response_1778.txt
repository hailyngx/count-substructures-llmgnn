Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (4, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10.
    - Pair 10: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 11: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 12: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 13: (14, 2) -> No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
