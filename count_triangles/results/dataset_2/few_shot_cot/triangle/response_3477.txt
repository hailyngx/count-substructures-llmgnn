Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <0, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <0, 2, 12>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <0, 6, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <1, 3, 16>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipped any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <2, 8, 16>.
    * Pair 2: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <2, 13, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <3, 12, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <4, 5, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipped any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (17, 0) -> 17 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <6, 17, 0>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, and 15:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 11. 
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skipped pairs involving nodes smaller than 12.
    * Pair 1: (13, 9) -> 13 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 14. 
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skipped any pairs with nodes smaller than 16.
    * Pair 1: (15, 5) -> 15 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 16, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 17, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed <17, 0, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 18, 19:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
