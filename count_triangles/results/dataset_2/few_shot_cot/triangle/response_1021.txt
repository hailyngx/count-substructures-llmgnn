Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (1, 3, 4, 7).
    - Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (2, 3, 4, 6, 10).
    - Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (3, 14).
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (4, 10, 12).
    - Pair 1: (4, 10) -> Already considered with Node 0, so skip.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (7).
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (6, 8, 11, 12).
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (12).
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8 to Node 14:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is a total of [1] triangle in the given graph.
