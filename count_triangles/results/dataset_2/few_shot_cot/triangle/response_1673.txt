Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with node 4 as well.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 8 as well.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 1 as well.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with node 4 as well.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 8 as well.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 0 as well.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with node 6 as well.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with node 9 as well.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 8 as well.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with the available nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 1 as well.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with the available nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Forms a triangle with node 9 as well.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with the available nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
