Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list and are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Only one neighbor (Node 4) to form a triangle with. No other nodes left.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller. No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list and are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list and are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller. No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller. No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list and are both 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are directly connected as shown in the edge list and are both 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller. No pairs to consider.

* Node 9:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list and are both 1-hop neighbors of 9. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are directly connected and are both 1-hop neighbors of 10. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller. No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as they are smaller. No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 as they are smaller. No pairs to consider.

    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 as they are smaller. No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
