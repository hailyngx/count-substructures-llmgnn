Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Triangle found: <7, 4, 11>

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2
        
        * Triangles found: <0, 8, 12>, <1, 8, 12>

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Triangle found: <2, 9, 11>

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 4.
* Triangles found: <7, 4, 11>, <0, 8, 12>, <1, 8, 12>, <2, 9, 11>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
The final answer is [4].
