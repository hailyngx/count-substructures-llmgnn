Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, continue this process for Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to find the total number of triangles in the graph.

After evaluating all nodes, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 8, 1>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 13, 6>
<5, 10, 11>
<9, 7, 12>
