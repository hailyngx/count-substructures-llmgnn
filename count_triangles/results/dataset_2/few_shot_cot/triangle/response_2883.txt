Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

1. Nodes and their 1-hop neighbors:
    - Node 0: {10, 3, 2, 13}
    - Node 1: {5, 7, 8, 12, 14}
    - Node 2: {5, 4, 14, 0}
    - Node 3: {9, 6, 10, 11, 0}
    - Node 4: {9, 7, 12, 2, 13}
    - Node 5: {9, 2, 1, 11, 14}
    - Node 6: {3}
    - Node 7: {4, 11, 10, 13, 1}
    - Node 8: {12, 1}
    - Node 9: {5, 4, 3, 13}
    - Node 10: {7, 0, 3, 13}
    - Node 11: {5, 7, 3}
    - Node 12: {4, 8, 14, 1}
    - Node 13: {9, 4, 7, 10, 0}
    - Node 14: {5, 12, 1, 2}

2. Counting triangles for each node:
    - Node 0:
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 1:
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 2:
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 3:
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 4:
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 5:
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 6:
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 7:
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 8:
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 9:
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 10:
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 11:
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 12:
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 13:
        * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Node 14:
        * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Summarizing the triangles:
    Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
