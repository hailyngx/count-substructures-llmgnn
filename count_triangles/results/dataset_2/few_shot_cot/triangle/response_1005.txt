Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 is connected to 0 and 5, but there is no direct edge between 0 and 5. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 is connected to 0 and 8, but there is no direct edge between 0 and 8. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 is connected to 0 and 8, and 0 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 is connected to 1 and 5, but there is no direct edge between 1 and 5. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 is connected to 1 and 9, but there is no direct edge between 1 and 9. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 is connected to 1 and 9, and 1 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
  - No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 is connected to 3 and 6, and 3 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  - No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  - No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  - No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
  - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  - No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
  - No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
  - No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 3
