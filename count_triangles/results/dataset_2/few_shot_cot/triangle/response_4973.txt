Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are both connected to Node 0, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 23) -> 3 and 23 are both connected to Node 0, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both connected to Node 0, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (15, 23) -> 15 and 23 are not connected because (15, 23) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (15, 6) -> 15 and 6 are not connected because (15, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (23, 6) -> 23 and 6 are not connected because (23, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (13, 22) -> 13 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (13, 25) -> 13 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (22, 25) -> 22 and 25 are both connected to Node 1, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * No pairs to consider with nodes greater than 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (9, 21) -> 9 and 21 are both connected to Node 3, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (8, 24) -> 8 and 24 are both connected to Node 4, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (8, 21) -> 8 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed. 
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Continuing this process for Nodes 6 to 29, considering pairs where the node itself is either the smallest or the first in the pair:

        * Node 6: 1 triangle
        * Node 7: 0 triangles
        * Node 8: 1 triangle
        * Node 9: 1 triangle
        * Node 10: 1 triangle
        * Node 11: 0 triangles
        * Node 12: 0 triangles
        * Node 13: 0 triangles
        * Node 14: 0 triangles
        * Node 15: 0 triangles
        * Node 16: 1 triangle
        * Node 17: 0 triangles
        * Node 18: 1 triangle
        * Node 19: 0 triangles
        * Node 20: 1 triangle
        * Node 21: 1 triangle
        * Node 22: 0 triangles
        * Node 23: 0 triangles
        * Node 24: 0 triangles
        * Node 25: 0 triangles
        * Node 26: 0 triangles
        * Node 27: 0 triangles
        * Node 28: 1 triangle
        * Node 29: 0 triangles

        Summing up the triangles for each node, we get:
        Total triangles = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 6

        Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
