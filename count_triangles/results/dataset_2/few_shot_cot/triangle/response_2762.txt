Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 9) -> 15 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (15, 18) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 12) -> 15 and 12 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 0) -> 15 and 0 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 9) -> 12 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19: 
    None of these nodes have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
