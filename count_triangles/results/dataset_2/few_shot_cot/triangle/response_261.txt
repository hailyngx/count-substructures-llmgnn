Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<7, 9, 6>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
