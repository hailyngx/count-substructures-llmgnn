* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 3 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 4 (Node 14) = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
[<4, 7, 14>, <7, 14, 4>, <12, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 14>, <12, 4, 6>, <12, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 11>, <4, 12, 7>, <14, 4, 7>, <8, 4, 12>, <6, 4, 12>, <14, 7, 12>, <5, 9, 12>, <4, 1, 14>, <9, 11, 4>, <7, 12, 14>, <5, 6, 12>, <4, 8, 12>]
