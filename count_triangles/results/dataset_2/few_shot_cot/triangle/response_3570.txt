Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 2 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> Triangle formed as 6, 2, and 1.
    * Pair 6: (4, 2) -> Triangle formed as 4, 2, and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 3 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

Continuing with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes greater than 5 to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes greater than 6 to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes greater than 7 to form triangles.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Not enough nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
