Response:
Following the step-by-step approach explained earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 2 are also connected as (4, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are also connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Already counted in Node 1's triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
