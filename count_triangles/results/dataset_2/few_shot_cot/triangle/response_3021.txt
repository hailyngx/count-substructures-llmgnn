Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 18) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (12, 18) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (12, 3) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 7: (12, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 8: (18, 3) -> Connected as (18, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (18, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 10: (3, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 19) -> Connected as (0, 19) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (19, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (15, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (15, 17) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 17) -> Connected as (9, 17) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> Connected as (4, 18) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (18, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> Connected as (10, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (16, 7) -> Connected as (16, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (16, 6) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (16, 19) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> Connected as (8, 19) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 2) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10 are skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (14, 3) -> Connected as (14, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 13, 14, 15 are skipped for the same reason as before.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> Connected as (9, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (19, 2) -> Connected as (19, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (10, 0) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Connected as (5, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Calculating the total triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 9.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
