* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Let's check if they have a common neighbor.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 13>, <2, 3, 11>, <5, 0, 19>, <6, 9, 14>, <11, 7, 18>, <13, 8, 2>, <17, 1, 19>, <17, 1, 5>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
