Node 5 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as 4 is the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as 5 is the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped since they have fewer than two nodes greater than their respective values to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [6].
