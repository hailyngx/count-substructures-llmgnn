Response:
Following the method shown in the example with the updated graph information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 2

* Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * Node 4: Total triangles = 2
    * Node 5: No triangles
    * Node 6: No triangles
    * Node 7: No triangles
    * Node 8: No triangles
    * Node 9: No triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 11.
