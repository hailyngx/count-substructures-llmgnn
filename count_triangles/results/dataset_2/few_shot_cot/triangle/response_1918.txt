Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are connected. 
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and are connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and are connected.
    * Pair 4: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and are connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and are connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now continue the process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to find the total number of triangles in the graph.
