Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
            * No more triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
            * No more triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 0 are also connected as (4, 0) shown in the edge list.
            * No more triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
            * No more triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * There are no triangles that can be formed with Node 8 or Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

        Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
