Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 27) -> 0 and 27 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors but not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (1, 18) -> Already counted when considering Node 1.
    - Pair 2: (2, 22) -> 2 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are connected.

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 for the same reason as Node 3.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 2.
 
Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [2].
