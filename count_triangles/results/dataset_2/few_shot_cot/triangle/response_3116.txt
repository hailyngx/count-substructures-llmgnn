Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as Node 1 and Node 3 are smaller than Node 0.
    * Pair 2: Skipped as Node 1 and Node 4 are smaller than Node 0.
    * Pair 3: Skipped as Node 3 and Node 4 are smaller than Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: Skipped as 18 and 0 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skipped all pairs as the other nodes connected to Node 1 are smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipped all pairs as the only connected node to Node 2 is smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skipped all pairs as the other nodes connected to Node 3 are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped all pairs as the other nodes connected to Node 4 are smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipped all pairs as the other nodes connected to Node 5 are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 7) -> 16 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 15) -> 16 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skipped all pairs as the other nodes connected to Node 7 are smaller than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 - 19:
    * Skipped all nodes greater than 7 as there are not enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
