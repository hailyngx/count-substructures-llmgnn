Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, I will now carefully count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 12) -> 16 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 2) -> Ignored as it is the same node.
    * Pair 4: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 15) -> Already counted in Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes, no more nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No more nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (18, 13) -> 18 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
