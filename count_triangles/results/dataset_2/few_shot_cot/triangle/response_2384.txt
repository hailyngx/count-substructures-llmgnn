Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) - 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 7>
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) - 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) - 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    * Skip as all other nodes are smaller than 4, and triangles with larger nodes as the smallest numbered node have been counted.

6. Node 5:
    * Skip for the same reason as Node 4.

7. Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    * Skip as all other nodes are smaller than 7, and triangles with larger nodes as the smallest numbered node have been counted.

9. Node 8:
    * Skip as all other nodes are smaller than 8, and triangles with larger nodes as the smallest numbered node have been counted.

10. Node 9:
    * Skip as all other nodes are smaller than 9, and triangles with larger nodes as the smallest numbered node have been counted.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 5

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
