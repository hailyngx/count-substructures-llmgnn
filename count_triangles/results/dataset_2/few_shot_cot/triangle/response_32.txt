Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 1

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> Both 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> Both 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Both 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (0, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Both 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (0, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No possible triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [6].
