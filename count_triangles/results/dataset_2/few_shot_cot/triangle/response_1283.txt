Response:
Following the steps outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (9, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (9, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (9, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are **5 triangles** in the given graph.
