Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 8 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 3 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 18

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are:
[<0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 7, 1>, <1, 11, 4>, <1, 11, 7>, <1, 11, 5>, <1, 11, 0>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 0>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 2, 0>, <10, 11, 9>, <10, 6, 2>, <10, 6, 9>, <13, 11, 6>]
