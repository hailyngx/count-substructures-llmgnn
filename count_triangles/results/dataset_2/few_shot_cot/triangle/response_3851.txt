Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are directly connected. No 1-hop neighbor relationship to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. No other node greater than 2 to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Only connected to Node 9. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. No other node greater than 4 to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. No other node greater than 6 to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
