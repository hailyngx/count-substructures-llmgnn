Response:
Following the step-by-step method provided in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continuing this process for Nodes 11 to 19 and summing up the total triangles formed by each node:

Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
