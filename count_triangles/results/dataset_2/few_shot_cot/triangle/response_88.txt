Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 5) -> 17 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected as (8, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 19), but since 1 and 19 are both smaller than 10, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangle formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * No triangle formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * No triangle formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * The only pair we could consider is (17, 0), but since 0 is smaller than 13, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangle formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * No triangle formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 15.
    * No triangle formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 16.
    * No triangle formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 17.
    * No triangle formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 18.
    * No triangle formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 19.
    * No triangle formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: [1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
