Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 10) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 10) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 10) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 18) -> Both 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (16, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * The pairs with higher numbered nodes are smaller than 4, so we skip them.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pairs involve nodes that are not directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pairs involve nodes that are not directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> Both 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (18, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pairs involve nodes that are not directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (16, 2) -> Both 16 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> Both 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (18, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * The pairs with higher numbered nodes are smaller than 18, so we skip them.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pairs involve nodes that are not directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
