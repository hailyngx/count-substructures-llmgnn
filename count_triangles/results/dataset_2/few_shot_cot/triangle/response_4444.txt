Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 26) 
        - One common neighbor: Node 4
        - Not directly connected
        - No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) 
        - One common neighbor: Node 4
        - Not directly connected
        - No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) 
        - One common neighbor: Node 4
        - Not directly connected
        - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) 
        - One common neighbor: Node 5
        - Directly connected
        - No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) 
        - One common neighbor: Node 6
        - Not directly connected
        - No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (6, 19) 
        - One common neighbor: Node 6
        - Not directly connected
        - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing the process for each node:
* Node 2 - 0 triangles
* Node 3 - 2 triangles
* Node 4 - 0 triangles
* Node 5 - 0 triangles
* Node 6 - 0 triangles
* Node 7 - 2 triangles
* Node 8 - 0 triangles
* Node 9 - 0 triangles
* Node 10 - 0 triangles
* Node 11 - 8 triangles
* Node 12 - 1 triangle
* Node 13 - 0 triangles
* Node 14 - 0 triangles
* Node 15 - 0 triangles
* Node 16 - 1 triangle
* Node 17 - 1 triangle
* Node 18 - 0 triangles
* Node 19 - 0 triangles
* Node 20 - 1 triangle
* Node 21 - 0 triangles
* Node 22 - 0 triangles
* Node 23 - 2 triangles
* Node 24 - 0 triangles
* Node 25 - 2 triangles
* Node 26 - 6 triangles
* Node 27 - 0 triangles
* Node 28 - 4 triangles
* Node 29 - 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 6 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 27.

Therefore, there are 27 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [27].
