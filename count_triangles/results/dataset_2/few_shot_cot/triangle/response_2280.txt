Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 1

Response:
Following the same logic as the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 1 to 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [2].
