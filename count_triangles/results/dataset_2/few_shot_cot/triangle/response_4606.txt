Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list. They are also 1-hop neighbors of 0. 
    - Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list. They are also 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    - Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    - Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list. They are both 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    - Pair 2: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list. They are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list. They are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list. They are both 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    - Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list. They are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list. They are also 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    - Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list. They are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Remaining nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - Skipped because there are no other pairs that can form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 
So, the answer is [5].
