Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 2: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 11) -> 12 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:

    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than Node 12.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 5, 10, 11, and 12 as they are smaller than Node 13.
    * Pair 1: (14, 8) -> 14 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 9.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
