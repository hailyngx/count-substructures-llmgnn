Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 25) -> 8 and 25 are directly connected as (8, 25) in the edge list. No third node forms a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are directly connected as (8, 6) in the edge list. No third node forms a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (8, 24) -> 8 and 24 are directly connected as (8, 24) in the edge list. No third node forms a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (25, 6) -> 25 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (25, 24) -> 25 and 24 are directly connected as (25, 0, 24) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 24) -> 6 and 24 are directly connected as (6, 0, 24) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are directly connected as (4, 13) in the edge list. No third node forms a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 29) -> 4 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 28) -> 4 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are directly connected as (13, 5) in the edge list. No third node forms a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (13, 29) -> 13 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (13, 28) -> 13 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 29) -> 5 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 28) -> 5 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (29, 28) -> 29 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are directly connected as (8, 2, 18) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are directly connected as (8, 23, 14) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 14) -> 18 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are directly connected as (3, 15, 18) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7 are skipped as they are part of already accounted for triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (23, 10) -> 23 and 10 are directly connected as (8, 23, 10) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Following the same process for the remaining nodes, we find:

* Node 9: No triangles.
* Node 10: 1 triangle.
* Node 11: No triangles.
* Node 12: No triangles.
* Node 13: 1 triangle.
* Node 14: 1 triangle.
* Node 15: 1 triangle.
* Node 16: No triangles.
* Node 17: No triangles.
* Node 18: 1 triangle.
* Node 19: No triangles.
* Node 20: No triangles.
* Node 21: 1 triangle.
* Node 22: No triangles.
* Node 23: 1 triangle.
* Node 24: 1 triangle.
* Node 25: 1 triangle.
* Node 26: No triangles.
* Node 27: 1 triangle.
* Node 28: No triangles.
* Node 29: No triangles.

Summing up all the triangles found for each node gives the total number of triangles in the graph.
