Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 18) -> Node 13 is connected to Node 18. No further common neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> Node 6 and Node 14 are connected, but no further common neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (6, 19) -> Node 6 and Node 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Node 5 and Node 14 are connected, but no further common neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> Node 18 and Node 19 are connected, but no further common neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (17, 10) -> Node 17 and Node 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 19) -> Node 10 and Node 19 are connected, but no further common neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> Node 6 and Node 17 are connected, but no further common neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11 to 19: No possible triangles due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles:
