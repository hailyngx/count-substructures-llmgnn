Response:
Proceeding with the triangle counting for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
