Response:
Following the step-by-step approach shown in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (9, 0, 14) in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 19). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because there is no direct edge between 10 and 14 in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (14, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (14, 28) -> Both 14 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 14, 28) in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 23) -> Both 14 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 7) -> Both 14 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (14, 7). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (23, 28) -> Both 23 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 23, 28) in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (23, 7) -> Both 23 and 7 are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (28, 7) -> Both 28 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (28, 7). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (29, 5) -> Both 29 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 29, 5) in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (29, 24) -> Both 29 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 29, 24) in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 24) -> Both 5 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (25, 7) -> 25 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (25, 26) -> 25 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 25, 26) in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 26) -> 7 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The process will continue in the same manner for the remaining nodes until all possible triangles are counted. Once all nodes have been covered, the total number of unique triangles found should be enclosed in brackets [].
