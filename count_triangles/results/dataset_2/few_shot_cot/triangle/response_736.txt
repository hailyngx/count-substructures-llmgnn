Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 6, 8>
    * Pair 4: (12, 11) -> 12 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 4) -> 15 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 17, 18>
    * Pair 2: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 16) -> 17 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (18, 16) -> 18 and 16 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 16, 18>
    * Pair 6: (19, 16) -> 19 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 6, 16>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 have already been calculated in the process above.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: <7, 12, 18>
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 13 and 14 have already been calculated in the process above.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

[<0, 6, 8>, <2, 17, 18>, <2, 16, 18>, <4, 6, 16>, <7, 12, 18>]
