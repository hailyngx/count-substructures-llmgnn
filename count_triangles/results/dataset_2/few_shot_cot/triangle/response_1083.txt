Response:
Following the same process as the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 4 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 1 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
