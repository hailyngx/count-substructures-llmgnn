Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's proceed to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 10) - 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 1) - 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 1**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 10) - 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 2**:
    - Skipped since nodes 0 and 1 are smaller, and there are no triangles with node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- **Node 3**:
    - No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than node 3.

- **Node 4**:
    - Skipped for the same reasons as node 2 and node 3.

- **Node 5**:
    - Pair 1: (7, 10) - 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 6) - 7 and 6 are directly connected. 
    - Pair 3: (7, 3) - 7 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 6**:
    - Pair 1: (7, 13) - 7 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 7**:
    - Skipped due to smaller numbered nodes forming a triangle.

- **Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14**:
    - Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 2

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
