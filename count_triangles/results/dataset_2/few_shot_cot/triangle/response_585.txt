Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 23) -> Both 12 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> Both 3 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (6, 17) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (21, 25) -> Both 21 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (21, 25) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, and 12:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 10, 11, or 12.

* Node 13:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14-29 (till 29):
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 14-29.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
