Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are directly connected, and also 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Already counted in Node 2. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles we found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
