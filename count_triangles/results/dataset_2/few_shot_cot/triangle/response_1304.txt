Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as there are no other nodes to form a triangle with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 29) -> 4 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 29) -> 16 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (19, 21) -> 19 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as there are no other nodes to form a triangle with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (27, 28) -> 27 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (16, 27) -> 16 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 20:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 20, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 1 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
