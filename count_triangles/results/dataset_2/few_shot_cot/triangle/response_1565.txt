Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as there is only one connection.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) - 4 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are both connected to 2, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) - 5 and 13 are connected to 2 and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) - 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) - 4 and 11 are both connected to 3, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) - 9 and 4 are both connected to 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) - 9 and 11 are both connected to 3, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) - 7 and 12 are both connected to 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are both connected to 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 13) - 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) - 7 and 6 are both connected to 5, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) - 7 and 2 are connected to 5, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (13, 12) - 13 and 12 are connected to 6, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:

    * Pair 1: (10, 11) - 10 and 11 are connected to 7, but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
