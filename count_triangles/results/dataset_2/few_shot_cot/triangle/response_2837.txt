Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, I will now find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (9, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 16) -> 19 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (19, 0, 16) shown in the edge list forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (13, 15) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 7) -> 15 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Both 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) -> Both 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (8, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (9, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles found with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (9, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 9.
    * No triangles found with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * No triangles found with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 8) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
