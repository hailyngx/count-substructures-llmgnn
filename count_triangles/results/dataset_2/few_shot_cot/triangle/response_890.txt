Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2)

Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 1

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 5
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 2
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 5
    * Pair 4: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (6, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 5
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 5
    * Pair 4: (4, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 5
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 2
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 5
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
