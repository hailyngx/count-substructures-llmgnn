Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Repeating pairs with Node 0, hence skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 2), but since neither 8 nor 2 is greater than 7, we skip this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
