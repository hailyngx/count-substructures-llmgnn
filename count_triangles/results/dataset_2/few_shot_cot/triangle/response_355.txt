Response:
Following the step-by-step process illustrated in the initial example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 12 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 12 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 13 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 13 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), we can find the total number of triangles and list them inside <> brackets.

The final answer will be presented as follows: 
[Total number of triangles in the graph: ]
[Triangles: <> <> ...]
