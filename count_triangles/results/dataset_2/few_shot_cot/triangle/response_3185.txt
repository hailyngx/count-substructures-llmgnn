Response:
Following the step-by-step approach as shown in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 17>
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>
    * No more pairs left to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 11) -> Triangle formed: <1, 11, 17>
    * Pair 2: (17, 0) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 17>
    * Pair 3: (17, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 0) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 17>
    * No more pairs left to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 8>
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs left to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) -> Triangle formed: <3, 7, 8>
    * No more pairs left to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> Triangle formed: <4, 7, 11>
    * No more pairs left to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (18, 5) -> Triangle formed: <5, 18, 19>
    * No more pairs left to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (13, 6), but since 6 is smaller than 13, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (17, 1) -> Triangle formed: <1, 7, 17>
    * Pair 2: (17, 0) -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 17>
    * Pair 3: (17, 19) -> Triangle formed: <7, 14, 19>
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed: <3, 7, 8>
    * No more pairs left to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> Triangle formed: <3, 7, 8>
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs left to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> Triangle formed: <9, 14, 19>
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs left to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10 to 19:
Following the same process, we find no triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 14

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
