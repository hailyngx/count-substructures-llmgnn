Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs that involve nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [6].
