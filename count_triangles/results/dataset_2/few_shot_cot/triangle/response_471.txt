Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Skip any pair that includes nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 0.
    - Pair 1: (23, 19) -> Connected to 23 and 19, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (23, 10) -> Connected to 23 and 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (23, 15) -> Connected to 23 and 15, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
