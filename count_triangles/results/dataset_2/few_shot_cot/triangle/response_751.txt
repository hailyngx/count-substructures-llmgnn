Response:
Applying the same method as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 10 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5 to 14:
    * Follow the process for each node. 

After applying the process to all nodes, we find the following total triangles for each node as the smallest numbered node:
0 -> 2
1 -> 1
2 -> 1
3 -> 1
4 -> 1
5 -> 0
6 -> 1
7 -> 0
8 -> 1
9 -> 2
10 -> 1
11 -> 2
12 -> 1
13 -> 1
14 -> 0

Calculating the total number of triangles:
2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 15

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
