Response:
Following the step-by-step method outlined in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 5) -> Ignored as it refers to the same node.
    * Pair 3: (17, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No triangles possible with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles possible with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as nodes are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:

    * Pair 2: (9, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 4 (Node 17) + 2 (Node 18) + 2 (Node 19) = 21.

Therefore, there are [21] triangles in the given graph.
