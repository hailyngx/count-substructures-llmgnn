Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

Starting with each node one by one:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 8) -> both 14 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> both 11 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> both 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 10) -> both 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair including nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (16, 12) -> both 16 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair including nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> both 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair including nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> both 1 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> both 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> both 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair including nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) -> both 12 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair including nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> both 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    *Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pair including nodes 0-9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> both 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pair including nodes 0-11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pair including nodes 0-12 as they are smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pair including nodes 0-13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pair including nodes 0-14 as they are smaller than 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pair including nodes 0-15 as they are smaller than 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pair including nodes 0-16 as they are smaller than 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18 and Node 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 18 or 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are <1, 14, 10>, <4, 7, 17>, <5, 9, 17>, <7, 12, 17>, <1, 14, 10>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
