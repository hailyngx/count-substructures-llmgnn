Response:
Following a similar process as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * <0, 23, 24>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * <1, 6, 7>
    * <1, 6, 20>
    * <1, 7, 13>
    * <1, 7, 24>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * <2, 10, 29>
    * <2, 10, 16>
    * <2, 10, 14>
    * <2, 23, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * <3, 9, 17>
    * <3, 9, 21>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * <4, 10, 16>
    * <4, 14, 15>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * <6, 19, 21>
    * <6, 19, 21>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed.

* Node 8:
    * <8, 15, 29>
    * <8, 15, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * <9, 17, 19>
    * <9, 17, 21>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    * <10, 14, 16>
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 11-14:
    * No triangles can be formed.

* Node 15:
    * <15, 14, 29>
    * <15, 14, 29>
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 16-19:
    * No triangles can be formed.

* Node 20:
    * No triangles can be formed.

* Node 21:
    * <21, 19, 26>
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 22:
    * No triangles can be formed.

* Node 23:
    * <23, 21, 26>
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 24-29:
    * No triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 21) + 1 (Node 23) = 22.

Therefore, there are 22 triangles in the given graph.
