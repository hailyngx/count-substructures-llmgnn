Response:
Following the same method as in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
   - <0, 6, 7> forms a triangle.
   - No other triangles can be formed involving Node 0.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
   - <1, 8, 9> forms a triangle.
   - No other triangles can be formed involving Node 1.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
   - <2, 8, 9> forms a triangle.
   - No other triangles can be formed involving Node 2.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
   - <3, 7, 0> forms a triangle.
   - No other triangles can be formed involving Node 3.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
   - No triangles can be formed involving Node 4 as it does not have at least 2 nodes greater than 4.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
   - No triangles can be formed involving Node 5 given the existing connections.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
   - <6, 9, 7> forms a triangle.
   - No other triangles can be formed involving Node 6.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
   - <7, 9, 8> forms a triangle.
   - <7, 9, 3> forms a triangle.
   - No other triangles can be formed involving Node 7.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
   - <8, 9, 1> forms a triangle.
   - <8, 9, 5> forms a triangle.
   - No other triangles can be formed involving Node 8.
   - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
   - <9, 1, 8> forms a triangle.
   - <9, 1, 2> forms a triangle.
   - <9, 1, 7> forms a triangle.
   - <9, 2, 8> forms a triangle.
   - No other triangles can be formed involving Node 9.
   - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 4

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 4 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
