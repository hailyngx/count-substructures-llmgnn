Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 28) -> 7 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 28) -> 13 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 28) -> 14 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (19, 14) -> 19 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 2) -> 19 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (26, 21) -> 26 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (26, 2) -> 26 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 2) -> 21 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 24) -> 9 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 21) -> 9 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (24, 21) -> 24 and 21 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
Continue this process for all remaining nodes in the graph keeping track of the total triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node. Finally, add up all the total triangles for each node to obtain the total number of triangles in the graph.

Finally, output the final answer in brackets [].
