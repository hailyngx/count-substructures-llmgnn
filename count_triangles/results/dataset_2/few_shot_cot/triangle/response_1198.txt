Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 5, and node 2

Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <0, 9, 4>
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <0, 9, 4>
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <0, 9, 2>
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <0, 3, 4>
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 1: <0, 3, 1>
    * Pair 7: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 1: <0, 8, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <1, 3, 0>
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 8: <1, 3, 8>
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <1, 5, 0>
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <1, 5, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <2, 9, 0>
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 1: <2, 3, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <3, 1, 0>
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 8: <3, 1, 8>
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <3, 1, 4>
    * Pair 4: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 have no triangles with other nodes larger than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
