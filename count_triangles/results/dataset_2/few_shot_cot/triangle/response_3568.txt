Response:
Following the same process as the previous example to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are interconnected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are interconnected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not interconnected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * All have no triangles with at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
