Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both connected to node 0, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    - Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    - Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph.
    - Pair 5: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are connected to node 0, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    - Pair 6: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    - Pair 7: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 0) is an edge in the graph.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected to node 1, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    - Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are connected to node 1, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    - Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected to node 1, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    - Pair 4: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are connected to node 1, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    - Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected to node 1, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    - Pair 6: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are connected to node 1, but they are not 1-hop neighbors.
    - Pair 7: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected to node 1, but they are not 1-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skipping pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (10, 6) is an edge.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    - No triangle can be formed with these nodes as there are no pairs that satisfy all the conditions.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
