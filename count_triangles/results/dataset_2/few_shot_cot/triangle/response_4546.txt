Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Not a valid pair as 1 < 5 in node number.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not a valid pair as 9 < 1 in node number.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Not a valid pair as 4 < 5 in node number.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> Not a valid pair as 0 < 5 in node number.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> Not a valid pair as 9 < 1 in node number.
    * Pair 6: (9, 0) -> Not a valid pair as 9 < 1 in node number.
    * Pair 7: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 0) -> Not a valid pair as 4 < 1 in node number.
    * Pair 9: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs that involve nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of node 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Similar process as above to find total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Similar process as above to find total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed involving these nodes as there aren't at least two nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<4, 9, 7>, <4, 9, 2>]
