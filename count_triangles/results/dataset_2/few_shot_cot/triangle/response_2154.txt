Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
   * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle.
   * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected. No third node is connected to both 1 and 11. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle.
   * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
   * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, but they are not connected. No triangle.
   * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are connected. No third node is connected to both 5 and 11. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are connected. No third node is connected to both 1 and 12. No triangle.
   * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
   * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 2, and they are connected. No third node is connected to both 5 and 9. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of node 2, but they are not connected. No triangle.
   * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of node 2, and they are connected. No third node is connected to both 5 and 11. No triangle.
   * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
   * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 3, and they are connected. No third node is connected to both 8 and 9. No triangle.
   * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of node 3, but they are not connected. No triangle.
   * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of node 3, and they are connected. No third node is connected to both 9 and 11. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
   * Skip similar to Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3 as they are smaller than 4.
   * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
   * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No possible triangles.
   * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
   * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

8. Node 7:
   * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
   * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
   * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Node 10:
   * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 11:
   * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. Node 12:
   * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 13:
   * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. Node 14:
   * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
