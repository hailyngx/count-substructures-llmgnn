Response:
Following the same process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - No connection between 9 and 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) - No connection between 9 and 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) - No connection between 9 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 10) - No connection between 9 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 3) - No connection between 1 and 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 14) - No connection between 1 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (1, 10) - No connection between 1 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 14) - No connection between 3 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 10) - No connection between 3 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (14, 10) - No connection between 14 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No connection between 5 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) - No connection between 5 and 13. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) - No connection between 5 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) - No connection between 7 and 13. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 10) - No connection between 7 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 10) - No connection between 13 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) - No connection between 9 and 11. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
 
* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) - No connection between 9 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) - No connection between 9 and 13. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) - No connection between 9 and 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) - No connection between 7 and 13. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped due to smaller nodes or lack of available pairs.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
