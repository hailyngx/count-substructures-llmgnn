Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as shown in the example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 4) -> Node 2, 4, and Node 0 form a triangle. <0, 2, 4>
    - Pair 5: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Node 1, 2, and 8 form a triangle. <1, 2, 8>
    - Pair 4: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 8) -> Node 1, 3, and 8 form a triangle. <1, 3, 8>
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Possible triangle: (5, 6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Possible triangles: (6, 9, 1) and (6, 2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - The only pair we could consider is (0, 2), but since 0 and 2 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Possible triangles: (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 2), (2, 4, 7), and (4, 6, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - The only pair we could consider is (0, 4), but since 0 and 4 are both smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Final count and unique triangles:
[<0, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 8>]
