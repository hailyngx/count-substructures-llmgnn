Response:
Following the same procedure as in the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 20) -> 15 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 6) -> 15 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 6) -> 20 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 20 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes a smaller numbered node.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (18, 12) -> 18 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29, and then sum up the total number of triangles.

After calculating, you can output the final answer inside brackets [].
