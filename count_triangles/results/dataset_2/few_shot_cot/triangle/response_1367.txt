Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) - 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) - 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) - 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) - 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) - 1 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) - 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 1: (6, 13) - 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) - 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) - 9 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 2: (9, 3) - 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) - 1 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No additional pairs left to consider.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) - 13 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * No additional pairs left to consider.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 as they are smaller than 13.
    * Pair 1: (14, 2) - 14 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

The triangles found are: <1, 3, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <6, 1, 9>, <4, 3, 14>.

Calculating the total number of triangles, we get:
[4]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
