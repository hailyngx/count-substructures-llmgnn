Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No additional triangles found beyond those already counted in previous nodes.

Let's continue this process for the remaining nodes.
