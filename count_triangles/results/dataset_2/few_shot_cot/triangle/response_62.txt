Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (13, 18) shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as there is an edge between them.
        * Pair 3: (18, 6) -> 18 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (18, 0) and (0, 6) shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 2) and (2, 17) in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 4) and (2, 19) in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (17, 12) -> 17 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        Similar to Node 0, a triangle is formed with Node 3 too.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        Skip pairs directly and indirectly addressed in previous nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5 to Node 19 are skipped or have no triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
