    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> 0 and 15 are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 15>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes as the smallest numbered node. No additional triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs of nodes with higher numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 3, 14>, <0, 4, 15>]
