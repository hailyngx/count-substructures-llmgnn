Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above, let's determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Not connected
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Not connected
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> Not connected
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> Not connected
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> Not connected
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Not connected
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Not connected
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Not connected
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> Not connected
    * Pair 5: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (9, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (0, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (0, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (5, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected as (1, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
