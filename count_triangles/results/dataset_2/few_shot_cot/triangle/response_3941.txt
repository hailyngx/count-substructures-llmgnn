Response:
Following the step-by-step triangle counting process for each node:

* Node 0:
    1. Pair 1: (5, 16) -> Nodes 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    2. Pair 2: (5, 24) -> Nodes 5 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    3. Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    1. Pair 1: (2, 14) -> Nodes 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    2. Pair 2: (2, 27) -> Nodes 2 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected as (2, 27). 
    3. Pair 3: (14, 27) -> Nodes 14 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    4. Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    1. Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    2. Pair 1: (9, 29) -> Nodes 9 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    3. Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    1. Pair 1: (14, 26) -> Nodes 14 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected as (14, 26).
    2. Pair 2: (14, 24) -> Nodes 14 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    3. Pair 3: (24, 26) -> Nodes 24 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    4. Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    1. No possible triangles as there are no other nodes greater than 4.
    2. Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Given the limitations in the provided adjacency list, the process will continue for the remaining nodes following the same structure.
