Response:
Following the step-by-step approach, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 22) -> Both 16 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 19) -> Both 16 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 19) -> Both 22 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (21, 24) -> 21 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 27) -> 21 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 8) -> 21 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (25, 3) -> 25 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continue the same process for Nodes 3 to 29, considering pairs, skipping smaller-numbered nodes, and checking for triangle formations.

After computing the triangles for all nodes, add up the total number of triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node:

[Total number of triangles in the graph: ]
