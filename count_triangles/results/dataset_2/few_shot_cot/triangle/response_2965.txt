Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as they wouldn't have at least 2 nodes greater than them for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
