Response:
Following the same approach as demonstrated in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 17) (alternative direction) -> Same as Pair 1.
    * Pair 4: (14, 17) -> Both 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as 0 is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as 0 is smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.

    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

The final answer is [1].
