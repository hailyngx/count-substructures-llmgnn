Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 9 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 13 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 13 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 14 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Remaining pairs include nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Remaining pairs include nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 7 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Remaining pairs include nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 0>
<0, 6, 4>
<7, 0, 4>
<9, 5, 8>
<9, 5, 2>
<13, 12, 1>
<5, 11, 8>

Hence, the final answer is [8].
