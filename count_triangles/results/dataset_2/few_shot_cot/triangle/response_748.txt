Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 5 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 6 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [Triangle: <0, 5, 8>]

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs since there are no nodes greater than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [Triangle: <2, 0, 5>]

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [Triangle: <3, 0, 5>]
    
* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [Triangle: <4, 5, 8>]

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> No triangle formed since 0 and 2 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed since 0 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
