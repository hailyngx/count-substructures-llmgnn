Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 and 9 as they are greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
