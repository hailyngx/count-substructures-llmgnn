    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed <5, 7, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipped pairs involving nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed <3, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skipped pairs involving nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skipped pairs involving nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed <0, 13, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed <4, 5, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
