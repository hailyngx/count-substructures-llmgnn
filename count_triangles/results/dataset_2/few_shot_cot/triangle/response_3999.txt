Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 24) -> 4 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 24). Potential triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles involving Node 2: <2, 4, 24>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 7). Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 21) -> 4 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 21). Potential triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 21) -> 7 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles involving Node 3: <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 21>

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 23) -> 7 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (7, 23). Potential triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles involving Node 8: <8, 16, 23>

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with these nodes.

* Node 20:
    * No additional triangles can be formed involving Node 20.

* Node 21:
    * Pair 1: (16, 27) -> 16 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 21, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 8) = 5.
* Unique triangles: [<2, 4, 24>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 21>, <5, 7, 23>, <8, 16, 23>]

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
