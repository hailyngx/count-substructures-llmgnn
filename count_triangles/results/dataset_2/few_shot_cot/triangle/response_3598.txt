    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> Direct edge between 9 and 14 present. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Direct edge between 9 and 11 present. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> Direct edge between 9 and 14 present. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Direct edge between 1 and 14 present. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:  
   [5 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 5 (Node 14) = 25]

Therefore, there are 25 triangles in the given graph.
