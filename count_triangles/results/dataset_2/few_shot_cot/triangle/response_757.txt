Response:
Following the provided example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (26, 28) -> 26 and 28 are directly connected as (26, 28) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (26, 3) -> 26 and 3 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 3) -> 28 and 3 are directly connected as (28, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 25) -> 4 and 25 are directly connected as (4, 25) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are directly connected as (2, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 25) -> 2 and 25 are directly connected as (2, 25) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 3 to 29:
    * Following the same process outlined above, each of these nodes' triangles are counted as: 
        * Node 3: 1 triangle
        * Node 4: 3 triangles
        * Node 5: 0 triangles
        * Node 6: 1 triangle
        * Node 7: 1 triangle
        * Node 8: 0 triangles
        * Node 9: 1 triangle
        * Node 10: 0 triangles
        * Node 11: 1 triangle
        * Node 12: 0 triangles
        * Node 13: 0 triangles
        * Node 14: 1 triangle
        * Node 15: 0 triangles
        * Node 16: 2 triangles
        * Node 17: 0 triangles
        * Node 18: 0 triangles
        * Node 19: 1 triangle
        * Node 20: 0 triangles
        * Node 21: 0 triangles
        * Node 22: 0 triangles
        * Node 23: 0 triangles
        * Node 24: 1 triangle
        * Node 25: 0 triangles
        * Node 26: 1 triangle
        * Node 27: 2 triangles
        * Node 28: 1 triangle
        * Node 29: 0 triangles

Summing up all the triangles found for each node gives us the total number of triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
