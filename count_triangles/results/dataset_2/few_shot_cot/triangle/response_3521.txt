Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph by following the step-by-step process applied to each node:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
  * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Proceed similarly for nodes 5 to 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
