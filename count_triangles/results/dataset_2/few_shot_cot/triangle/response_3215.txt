Response:
Following the step-by-step process, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 28) -> 5 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (21, 13) -> 21 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 21 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (21, 13) -> 21 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 21 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 28) -> 4 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 28 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for all remaining nodes will allow us to find the total number of triangles in the graph.
