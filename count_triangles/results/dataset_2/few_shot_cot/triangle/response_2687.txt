Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example to count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - No valid pairs to form a triangle as all possible pairs involve nodes smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - No valid pairs to form a triangle as all possible pairs involve nodes smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - No valid pairs to form a triangle as all possible pairs involve nodes smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
