Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as described in the previous scenario, let's count the number of triangles in the graph provided.

* Node 0:
    * Skip the pair involving nodes smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> Both 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (triangles <1, 3, 4> and <1, 3, 6>)

* Node 2:
    * Skip the pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (triangle <3, 5, 7>)

* Node 4:
    * Skip the pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip the pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip the pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip the pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip the pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (triangle <5, 8, 9>)

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
