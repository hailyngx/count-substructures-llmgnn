Response:
Following the same step-by-step process outlined in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 1>.
    * Pair 6: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (0, 1), but since 0 and 1 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
