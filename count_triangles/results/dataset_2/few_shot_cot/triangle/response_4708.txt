Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 6, 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 6, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
   * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and directly connected. Triangle formed.
   * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and directly connected. Triangle formed.
   * Total triangles: 2

2. Node 1:
   * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and directly connected. Triangle formed.
   * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and directly connected. Triangle formed.
   * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and directly connected. Triangle formed.
   * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and directly connected. Triangle formed.
   * Pair 5: (1, 6) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and directly connected. Triangle formed.
   * Pair 6: (1, 9) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and directly connected. Triangle formed.
   * Total triangles: 6

3. Node 2:
   * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and directly connected. Triangle formed.
   * Total triangles: 1

4. Node 3:
   * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles: 0

5. Node 4:
   * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
   * Total triangles: 0

6. Node 5:
   * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
   * Total triangles: 0

7. Node 6:
   * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
   * Total triangles: 0

8. Node 7:
   * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
   * Total triangles: 0

9. Node 8:
   * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
   * Total triangles: 0

10. Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 6 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [9].
