Response:
Following the step-by-step method provided in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. 
    - Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. 
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. 
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. 
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7, 8, 9, 10:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs with nodes greater than these nodes.

* Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are also connected. 
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - Pair 1: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are also connected. 
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
