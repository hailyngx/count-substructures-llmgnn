Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Same as the previous example, Node 1 only has one pair of 1-hop neighbors: (1, 8). They are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Similar to the previous example, we have:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 6 to 9:
    * Following the same logic, since there are at least two nodes greater than or equal to Nodes 6 to 9, let's calculate the triangles for these nodes.

* The final count:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.
