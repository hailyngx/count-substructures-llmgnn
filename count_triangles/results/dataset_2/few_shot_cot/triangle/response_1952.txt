Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3:**
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:**
    * Skipping these nodes as they are smaller than the minimum required node for triangle formation.

6. **Summarizing the triangles:**
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 0, 8>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
