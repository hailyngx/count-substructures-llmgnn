Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 12) -> 15 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (15, 11) -> 15 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangle can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 is connected to node 14, but no other nodes to form a triangle with.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Follow the same process as above for these nodes.

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Follow the process for each of these nodes as shown above.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph by summing up the triangles found for each node:
\[2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Nodes 7-19) = 4\]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: <15, 12, 0>, <15, 19, 0>, <15, 12, 0>, and <6, 17, 7>.

Thus, the final answer is [4].
