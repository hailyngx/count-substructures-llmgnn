Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No additional triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 2.
    * No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are connected.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected.
    * Pair 8: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are connected.
    * Pair 9: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 4.
    * No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 5.
    * No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 6.
    * No additional triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 7.
    * No triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 8.
    * No triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 10.
    * No additional triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 11.
    * No additional triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 12.
    * No additional triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangle formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No additional triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
