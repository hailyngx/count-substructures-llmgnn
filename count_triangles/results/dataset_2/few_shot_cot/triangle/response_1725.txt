Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as there are no other pairs of nodes that are neighbors of Node 0 and connected to each other.

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as both the connected nodes of Node 1 (8, 15, 19) are smaller than Node 1.

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (13, 16) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 because all its neighbors are either smaller than 3 or not directly connected.

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (14, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (14, 16) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (12, 16) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    - Since all 1-hop neighbor pairs of Node 5 are already considered in previous steps, no additional triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 because its two neighbors are smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (18, 15) -> 18 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 because its three neighbors are smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 because its four neighbors are smaller than 9.

* Node 10:
    - Node 10 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as two of its connected nodes are smaller than 11.

* Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 because its connected node is smaller than 12.

* Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 because its connected node is smaller than 13.

* Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 because its connected nodes are smaller than 14.

* Node 15:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 15 because all its neighbors are either smaller than 15 or not directly connected.

* Node 16:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 16 because all its neighbors are either smaller than 16 or not directly connected.

* Node 17 and Node 18:
    - Cannot form any triangles individually as both are connected to smaller nodes only.

* Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as its connected nodes are smaller than 19.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles = Triangles from Node 0 + ... + Triangles from Node 19
Total triangles = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
Total triangles = 4

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
