Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. They form a triangle <0, 4, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. They form a triangle <0, 10, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 1. They form a triangle <1, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2. They form a triangle <2, 4, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2. They form a triangle <2, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2. They form a triangle <2, 8, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pairs involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No new triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node since other nodes have already been considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No new triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node since other nodes have already been considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No new triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node since other nodes have already been considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No new triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node since other nodes have already been considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No new triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node since other nodes have already been considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node since other nodes have already been considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No new triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node since other nodes have already been considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No new triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node since other nodes have already been considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No new triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node since other nodes have already been considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No new triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node since other nodes have already been considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No new triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node since other nodes have already been considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 4, 10>, <0, 10, 12>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 10>, <2, 8, 10>]
