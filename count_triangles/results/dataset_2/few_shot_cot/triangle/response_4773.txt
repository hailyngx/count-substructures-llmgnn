Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected with an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected with an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected with an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected with an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected with an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected with an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected with an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected with an edge. 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7: 
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:  
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19: 
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Nodes 9 to 19) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
