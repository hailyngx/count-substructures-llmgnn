Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are: [<5, 7, 13>, <5, 12, 14>, <5, 12, 6>, <6, 15, 4>, <16, 9, 13>, <13, 17, 7>, <2, 7, 17>, <2, 7, 5>, <2, 17, 13>, <0, 12, 15>, <0, 12, 5>]
