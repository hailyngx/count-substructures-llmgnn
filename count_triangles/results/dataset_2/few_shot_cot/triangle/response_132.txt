Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are connected to node 0. No edge exists between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 26) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 5) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 28) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (26, 5) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (26, 28) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 28) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 29) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 9) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (29, 9) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 23) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 26) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (15, 12) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 23) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 26) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (17, 12) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (23, 26) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (23, 12) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (26, 12) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (21, 22) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 20) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 20) -> Connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with the remaining nodes as there are no connected pairs.

Continuing this process for Nodes 8 to 29:

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 9:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 10:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 11:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 12:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 13:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 14:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 15:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 16:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 17:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 18:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 19:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 20:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 21:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 22:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 23:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 24:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 25:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 26:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 27:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 28:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 29:
    * Total triangles: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
