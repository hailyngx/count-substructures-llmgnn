Response:
Following the steps from the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (8, 15) -> Not connected.
  - Pair 2: (8, 16) -> Not connected.
  - Pair 3: (15, 16) -> Not connected.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 2.

* Node 3:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
  - Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
  - Pair 2: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected.
  - No more pairs to consider.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
  - Pair 1: (8, 17) -> Already considered in Node 4.
  - No more pairs to consider.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 9.

* Node 10:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 10.

* Node 11:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 11.

* Node 12:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 12.

* Node 13:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 13.

* Node 14:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 14.

* Node 15:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 15.

* Node 16:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 16.

* Node 17:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 17.

* Node 18:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 18.

* Node 19:
  - No triangles can be formed involving Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
