Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <0, 13, 14>).

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (Triangles <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 9, 13>).

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller nodes.
        * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <2, 5, 14>).

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller nodes.
        * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <4, 13, 14>).

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller nodes.

        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

    * Node 11:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 as they are smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

    * Node 12:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 as they are smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

    * Node 13:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 as they are smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

    * Node 14:

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
