Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph.

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Not a triangle since 1 is not connected to 2.
    - Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Not a triangle since 2 is not connected to 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Not a triangle since 5 and 1 are not connected.
    - Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Not a triangle since 9 and 1 are not connected.
    - Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Not a triangle since 6 and 1 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not a triangle since 3 and 2 are not connected.
    - Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed as they are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 
   
4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Not a triangle since 6 and 3 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. **Node 5:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    - No possible triangles as 5 has no 2-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    - No possible triangles as 6 has no 2-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Not a triangle since 9 and 7 are not connected.
    - Pair 2: (7, 4) -> Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. **Node 8:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    - No possible triangles as 8 has no 2-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    - Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Not a triangle since 1 and 9 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5. 

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
