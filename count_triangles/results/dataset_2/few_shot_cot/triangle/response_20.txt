Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (19, 25) -> 19 and 25 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 10 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 27) -> 3 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 29) -> 3 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 27) -> 9 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 23) -> 4 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 27) -> 5 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (20, 28) -> 20 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 20 and 28 are also connected as shown in the edge list.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (22, 29) -> 22 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 10 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and 0 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and 9 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and 5 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and 10 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15 to Node 30:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Nodes 15 to 30.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 2 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15 to Node 30) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
