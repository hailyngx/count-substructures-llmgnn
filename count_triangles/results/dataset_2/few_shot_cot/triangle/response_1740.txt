Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 6 are directly connected as there is an edge (7, 6) in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 1 are directly connected as (4, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 1 are directly connected as (7, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> Both 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 2), but since 6 and 2 are smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> Both 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 6 are directly connected as (7, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, respectively.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
