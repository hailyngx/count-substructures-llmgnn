Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 28) -> Both 16 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 23) -> Both 16 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (16, 0, 23) and (16, 4, 29, 21, 23). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 23) -> Both 28 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (forming triangle <0, 16, 23>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (19, 24) -> Both 19 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> Both 12 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 26) -> Both 6 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10:
    * Skipped because they are smaller than Node 11.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (15, 27) -> Both 15 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 21) -> Both 9 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are connected as (9, 21, 23) and (13, 14, 7, 22, 26, 3, 6, 23, 21). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 27) -> Both 9 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (forming triangle <9, 11, 21>)

Continue this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 13:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 14:
    * Total triangles: 2 (forming triangles <7, 14, 23> and <13, 14, 23>)
* Node 15:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 16:
    * Total triangles: 1 (forming triangle <16, 27, 29>)
* Node 17:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 18:
    * Total triangles: 2 (forming triangles <18, 24, 8> and <18, 24, 1>)
* Node 19:
    * Total triangles: 1 (forming triangle <19, 27, 29>)
* Node 20, 21, 22, 23, 24:
    * Skipped because there are no triangles involving them as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 25:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 26:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 27:
    * Total triangles: 2 (forming triangles <27, 16, 29> and <27, 19, 29>)
* Node 28:
    * Total triangles: 0
* Node 29:
    * Total triangles: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 2 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 2 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 12

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 16, 23>, <9, 11, 21>, <7, 14, 23>, <13, 14, 23>, <16, 27, 29>, <18, 24, 8>, <18, 24, 1>, <27, 16, 29>, <27, 19, 29>. 

Hence, the final answer is [12].
