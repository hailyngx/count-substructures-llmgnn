* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 1: <0, 10, 11>
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 6: <0, 10, 6>

    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 15

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
