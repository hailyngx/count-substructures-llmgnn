Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected, but 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 is isolated and not connected to any other nodes. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are connected, and 11 and 4 are also 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are connected, but 4 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are connected, and 16 and 19 are also connected as 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are connected, but 19 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 9) -> 10 and 9 are connected, and 10 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are connected, but 10 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 is only connected to Node 7, no other triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (17, 13) -> 17 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are connected, but 13 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are connected, and 19 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are connected, and 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 9. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10 to 19 are skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.
        
Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
