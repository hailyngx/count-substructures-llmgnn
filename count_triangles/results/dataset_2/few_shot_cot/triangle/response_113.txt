Response:
Following the method explained in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they share a common neighbor 1 making a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.    
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they share a common neighbor 3 making a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include previously processed nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include previously processed nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they share a common neighbor 1 making a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they share a common neighbor 1 making a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they share a common neighbor 1 making a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include previously processed nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they share a common neighbor 1 making a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they share a common neighbor 3 making a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they share a common neighbor 1 making a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include previously processed nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they share a common neighbor 1 making a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they share a common neighbor 5 making a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs that include previously processed nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs that include previously processed nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs that include previously processed nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs that include previously processed nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they share a common neighbor 3 making a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they share a common neighbor 5 making a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
