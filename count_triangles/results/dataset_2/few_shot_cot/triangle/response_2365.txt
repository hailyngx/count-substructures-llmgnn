Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * No triangles can be formed with only one neighbor.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.
    
    Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.

    The unique triangles found are:
    <2, 4, 6>
    <3, 5, 7>
    <4, 6, 7>
    <4, 6, 8>
    <4, 5, 7>
    <5, 6, 7>
    <5, 7, 9>
