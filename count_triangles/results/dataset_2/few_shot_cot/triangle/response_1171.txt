Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (7, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (6, 2) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Continuing with the same process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) - Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 8>]
