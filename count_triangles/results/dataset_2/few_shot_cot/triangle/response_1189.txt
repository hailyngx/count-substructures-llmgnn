Response:
Following the same process as the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (8, 11) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipping as there are no pairs with larger nodes.

* Node 2:
    * Skipping as there are no pairs with larger nodes.

* Node 3:
    * Skipping as there are no pairs with larger nodes.

* Node 4:
    * Skipping as there are no pairs with larger nodes.

* Node 5:
    * Skipping as there are no pairs with larger nodes.

* Node 6:
    * Skipping as there are no pairs with larger nodes.

* Node 7:
    * Skipping as there are no pairs with larger nodes.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (10, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (10, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Skipping the rest as there are no more pairs with larger nodes.

* Node 10:
    * Skipping as there are no pairs with larger nodes.

* Node 11:
    * Skipping as there are no pairs with larger nodes.

* Node 12:
    * Skipping as there are no pairs with larger nodes.

* Node 13:
    * Skipping as there are no pairs with larger nodes.

* Node 14:
    * Skipping as there are no pairs with larger nodes.

Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
