Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
