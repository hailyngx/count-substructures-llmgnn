Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Not a triangle, as node 4 and node 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> Not a triangle, as node 0 and node 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> Not a triangle, as node 0 and node 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (0, 3) -> Not a triangle, as node 0 and node 3 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> Not a triangle, as node 4 and node 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Not a triangle, as node 1 and node 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Only one pair with another node, which is Node 1, and it's smaller than 2. No triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Not a triangle, as node 9 and node 0 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Not a triangle, as node 3 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Not a triangle, as node 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Form a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Not a triangle, as node 8 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> Not a triangle, as node 8 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Not a triangle, as node 9 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
