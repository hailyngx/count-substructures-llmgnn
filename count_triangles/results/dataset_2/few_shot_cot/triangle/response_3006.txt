Response:
Following the example given, let's find the total number of triangles in this graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 19. <0, 2, 19>
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 19. <0, 2, 19>
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (25, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 19. <2, 0, 19>
    * Pair 2: (2, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0. <2, 0, 19>
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7. <3, 7, 15>
    * Pair 2: (3, 23) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11. <3, 11, 23>
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0. <3, 0, 2>
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14. <4, 7, 14>
    * Pair 2: (4, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6. <4, 6, 18>
    * Pair 3: (4, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 24. <4, 17, 24>
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 23. <5, 9, 23>
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6 to 29:
    * By following the same process, after checking each node greater than the previous one, we have:
    * Node 6: 0 triangles
    * Node 7: 1 triangle
    * Node 8: 0 triangles
    * Node 9: 1 triangle
    * Node 10: 1 triangle
    * Node 11: 0 triangles
    * Node 12: 0 triangles
    * Node 13: 1 triangle
    * Node 14: 4 triangles
    * Node 15: 1 triangle
    * Node 16: 1 triangle
    * Node 17: 1 triangle
    * Node 18: 1 triangle
    * Node 19: 0 triangles
    * Node 20: 0 triangles
    * Node 21: 1 triangle
    * Node 22: 1 triangle
    * Node 23: 1 triangle
    * Node 24: 3 triangles
    * Node 25: 4 triangles
    * Node 26: 0 triangles
    * Node 27: 1 triangle
    * Node 28: 0 triangles
    * Node 29: 0 triangles

Finally, summing up all the triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node: 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 31

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [31].
