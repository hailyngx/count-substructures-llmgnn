Response:
Following the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (11, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 11 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected by the edge (5, 16). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 11 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (13, 18) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 13 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

I will continue this process for Nodes 11 to 19 next.
