Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 8 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) - 4 and 2 are directly connected but are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, and 9 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 and 9 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
[<4, 1, 5>, <4, 9, 1>, <4, 6, 7>, <7, 8, 9>]
