Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 11: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
