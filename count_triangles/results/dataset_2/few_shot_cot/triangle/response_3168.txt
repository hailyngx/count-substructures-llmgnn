Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 18 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 24) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 24 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 28) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 28 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (18, 24) -> No triangle formed as 18 and 24 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (18, 28) -> No triangle formed as 18 and 28 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (18, 9) -> 18 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (18, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (24, 28) -> 24 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (24, 9) -> 24 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (28, 9) -> 28 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Only one neighbor to form a triangle with (9, 0) but that already covers the triangle formed with Node 0. No additional triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0 and 1 due to lower node numbers.
    * Pair 1: (28, 22) -> 28 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (28, 19) -> 28 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 21) -> 28 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (22, 19) -> No triangle formed as 22 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (22, 21) -> 22 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (19, 21) -> 19 and 21 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (27, 23) -> No triangle formed as 27 and 23 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8:
    * Skipped for being smaller than Nodes 0, 2.

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 9: 
    * Pair 1: (25, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

...

Continue this process for the rest of the nodes to find all triangles. Calculate the total number of triangles and list them within brackets [] at the end.
