Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
     * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
     * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
     * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
     * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 following the described pattern.

After calculating the total number of triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node and summing them up, you should get the final answer in brackets [].

Please proceed with the calculations for the remaining nodes and output the final answer inside brackets once you have completed the process.
