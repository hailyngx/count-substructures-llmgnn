Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the given example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Connected through Node 8
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> Connected through Node 8
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> Connected through Node 8
    * Pair 4: (8, 2) -> Connected through Node 8
    * Pair 5: (12, 5) -> Connected through Node 12
    * Pair 6: (12, 10) -> Connected through Node 12
    * Pair 7: (12, 2) -> Not connected directly
    * Pair 8: (10, 5) -> Connected through Node 10
    * Pair 9: (10, 2) -> Connected through Node 10
    * Pair 10: (5, 2) -> Connected through Node 5
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Connected through Node 4
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Connected through Node 3
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes ≤ 1.
    * No triangles found with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Connected through Node 1
    * Pair 2: (10, 6) -> Connected through Node 10
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes ≤ 3.
    * No triangles found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes ≤ 4.
    * No triangles found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes ≤ 5.
    * No triangles found with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes ≤ 7.
    * No triangles found with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles found with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes ≤ 9.
    * No triangles found with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles found with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles found with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles found with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles found with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) = 10

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
