Response:
Following the same method as the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 due to them being smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> Both 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. [3]
