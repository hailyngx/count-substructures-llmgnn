Response:
Following the provided instructions, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not a triangle, as 1 and 2 are not connected.
  * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Not a triangle, as 1 and 4 are not connected.
  * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> Not a triangle, as 1 and 0 are not connected.
  * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> Not a triangle, as 3 and 7 are not connected.
  * Pair 5: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 0 are directly connected as (3, 0) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 7: (3, 4) -> Not a triangle, as 3 and 4 are not connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Not a triangle, as 2 and 5 are not connected.
  * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Not a triangle, as 2 and 8 are not connected.
  * Pair 3: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 0 are directly connected as (2, 0) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> Not a triangle, as 2 and 7 are not connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Not a triangle, as 5 and 8 are not connected.
  * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 4 are directly connected as (5, 4) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Not a triangle, as 7 and 8 are not connected.
  * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> Not a triangle, as 7 and 6 are not connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Not a triangle, as 5 and 1 are not connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No triangles formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No triangles formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No triangles formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No triangles formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
