Response:
Following the step-by-step method to count triangles, here are the calculations for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 5: (7, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 6: (7, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 7: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0 as it has a smaller number.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0 and 1 as they have smaller numbers.
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0, 1, and 2 as they have smaller numbers.
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue the process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 4 as it has a smaller number.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 2 and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
