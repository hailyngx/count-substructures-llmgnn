Response:
Following the example provided, let's now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and there is an edge between 5 and 6 as shown.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 4) -> Both 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and there is an edge between 5 and 4 as shown.
    * Pair 5: (5, 0) -> Both 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 11) -> Both 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and there is an edge between 6 and 11 as shown.
    * Pair 7: (6, 13) -> Both 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (6, 4) -> Both 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (13, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and there is an edge between 9 and 4 as shown.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (13, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and there is an edge between 5 and 6 as shown.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Both 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (12, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 will provide the total number of triangles formed. Let's calculate and provide the final answer in the end.
