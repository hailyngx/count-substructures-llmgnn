Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - <5, 6, 9>: 5 and 6 are connected (5, 6), 6 and 9 are connected (6, 0, 9), but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

2. Node 1:
    - <5, 7, 9>: 5 and 7 are connected (5, 4, 7), 7 and 9 are connected (7, 1, 9), but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

3. Node 2:
    - <3, 4, 8>: 3 and 4 are connected (3, 2, 4), 4 and 8 are connected (4, 2, 8), and 3 and 8 are connected (3, 8). Triangle formed.

4. Node 3:
    - <1, 6, 8>: 1 and 6 are connected (1, 5, 6), 6 and 8 are connected (6, 8), but 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

5. Node 4:
    - <5, 7, 9>: Already counted in Node 1.

6. Node 5:
    - <1, 6, 8>: Already counted in Node 3.

7. Node 6:
    - <4, 7, 9>: 4 and 7 are connected (4, 7), 7 and 9 are connected (7, 1, 9), but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

8. Node 7:
    - <4, 6, 9>: Already counted in Node 6.

9. Node 8:
    - Already counted in Node 3 and Node 5.

10. Node 9:
    - <4, 7, 1>: 4 and 7 are connected (4, 7), 7 and 1 are connected (7, 1), but 4 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 1, Node 3, Node 6, Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
