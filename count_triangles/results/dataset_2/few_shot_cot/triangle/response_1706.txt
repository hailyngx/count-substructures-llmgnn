Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> Directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 21) -> Directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 21) -> Directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (26, 27) -> Directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (26, 8) -> Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 18, but node 18 is not a neighbor of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (27, 8) -> Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 18, but node 18 is not a neighbor of 27. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 20) -> Directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 15) -> Node 15 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 24, but node 2 is not a neighbor of 13. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 15) -> Directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 27), but since 4 is smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (12, 21) -> Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 21, and 27, but node 4 is not a neighbor of 21. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 3) -> Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 27, but node 4 is not a neighbor of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 3) -> Directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 5 to 29:

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> Directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 15) -> Already counted in previous pair.
    * Pair 3: (15, 24) -> Node 24 is connected to nodes 9, 22, and 15, but node 15 is not a neighbor of 24. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (18, 20) -> Directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (21, 3) -> Already counted in previous nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 27) -> Directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 24) -> Directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (0, 21) -> Already counted in previous nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 + 1 = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
