Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (18, 22) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 24) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 21) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 21) -> Triangle formed: <3, 7, 21>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (15, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6 to 9:
    * Following the same pattern:
        * Node 6: 0 triangles
        * Node 7: 0 triangles
        * Node 8: 0 triangles
        * Node 9: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
