Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * No nodes left to form triangles with as they are all greater in value.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (All other nodes) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
