Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * No valid pairs left to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

I will now continue this process for Nodes 6 through 18 and summarize the number of triangles at the end.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected.
    * No other valid pairs left to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * No valid pairs left to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * No valid pairs left to form triangles given the nodes are either 1-hop neighbors of smaller nodes or are smaller themselves.

* Nodes 15 and 16:
    * No other nodes available to form triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 17, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 18 and 19:
    * Skip as there aren't two nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
