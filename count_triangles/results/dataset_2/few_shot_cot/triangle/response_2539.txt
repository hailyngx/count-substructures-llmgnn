Response:
Following the method described in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Ignored as 3 is a smaller node than 5.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) - Both are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Ignored as 5 is a smaller node than 9.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Both are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) - Both are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) - Both are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 0) - Both are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) - Ignored as 4 is a smaller node than 5.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Ignored as 5 is a smaller node than 7.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) - Both are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 1) - Ignored as 1 is a smaller node than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Ignored as 4 is a smaller node than 8.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) - Ignored as 0 is a smaller node than 5.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) - Ignored as 0 is a smaller node than 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Ignored as 5 is a smaller node than 7.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - Ignored as 3 is a smaller node than 8.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) - Both are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - Both are 1-hop neighbors, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) - Ignored as 6 is a smaller node than 9.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) - Ignored as 0 is a smaller node than 5.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 1) - Ignored as 1 is a smaller node than 2.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
So, the answer is [7].
