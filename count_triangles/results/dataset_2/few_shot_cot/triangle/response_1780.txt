Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> Both 14 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (14, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> Both 2 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> Both 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> Both 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 11) -> Both 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 4) -> 13 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as (13, 4) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 3) -> 11 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pairs we could consider are (12, 14) and (12, 18), but since 12 and 14, as well as 12 and 18, are both smaller than 7, these pairs are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (17, 16) -> 17 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
