Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 2, 9, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 8, 7, and node 4

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will now count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, [6] is the number of triangles in the given graph.
