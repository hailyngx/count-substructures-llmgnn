Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial explanation, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected since they are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and there is an edge (2, 0) in the list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are directly connected as there is an edge (0, 6) in the list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are directly connected as there is an edge (0, 8) in the list.
    * Skip any other pairs that include nodes smaller than or equal to 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected as 1-hop neighbors of 1 and there is an edge (2, 8) in the list.
    * Skip any other pairs that include nodes smaller than or equal to 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected as 1-hop neighbors of 2 and there is an edge (4, 7) in the list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are connected as 1-hop neighbors of 2 and there is an edge (0, 8) in the list.
    * Skip any other pairs that include nodes smaller than or equal to 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected as there is an edge (6, 9) in the list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected as there is an edge (3, 7) in the list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are connected as 1-hop neighbors of 3 and there is an edge (0, 8) in the list.
    * Skip any other pairs that include nodes smaller than or equal to 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected as 1-hop neighbors of 4 and there is an edge (2, 7) in the list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected as there is an edge (4, 7) in the list.
    * Skip any other pairs that include nodes smaller than or equal to 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

No more triangles can be formed using nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as the smallest numbered nodes since there are no available pairs with two larger nodes to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 4, 7>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
