Response:
Following the example provided earlier, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 19) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 1 and 19.
    * Pair 2: (1, 28) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 1 and 28.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 1 and 5.
    * Pair 4: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are connected, but not 1 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors (they share a common node 0), so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 5: (19, 28) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 19 and 28.
    * Pair 6: (19, 5) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 19 and 5.
    * Pair 7: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are connected, but not 19 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors (they share a common node 4), so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 8: (28, 5) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 28 and 5.
    * Pair 9: (28, 12) -> 28 and 12 are connected, but not 28 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors (they share a common node 8), so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are connected, but not 5 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors (they share a common node 0), so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as they are smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (17, 15) -> 17 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 14) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 17 and 14.
    * Pair 3: (15, 14) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 15 and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (22, 26) -> 22 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (17, 6) -> 17 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 23) -> 17 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 23) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 6 and 23.
    * Pair 4: (6, 29) -> 6 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (23, 29) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 23 and 29.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (19, 23) -> 19 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

We will continue this process for the remaining nodes to count the total number of triangles in the graph.
