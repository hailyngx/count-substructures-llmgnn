Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 2

Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph by following the step-by-step process for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (7, 6) - Triangle <0, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (9, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (9, 5) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1 triangle] in the given graph.
