Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's compute the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) - 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 12 are also connected. Triangle formed. 
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) - 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) - 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 14 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 13) - 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 14) - 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 14) - 13 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) - 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) - 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) - 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 11 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) - 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) - 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 11 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) - 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) - 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 11 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * All possible pairs have been considered in previous calculations.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9 triangles] in the given graph.
