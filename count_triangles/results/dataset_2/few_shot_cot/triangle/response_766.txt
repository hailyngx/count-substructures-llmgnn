Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * The pairs that can be formed involving Node 1 are smaller than Node 1, so there are no triangles involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 21) -> 7 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 21 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 21) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 24) -> 18 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 18 and 24 are not directly connected as there is no edge (18, 24) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 13 are also connected as (5, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 4 to 29:

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 26) -> 13 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 13 and 26 are also connected as (13, 26) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 4 and 17 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (20, 27) -> 20 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 20 and 27 are also connected as (20, 27) shown in the edge list.
