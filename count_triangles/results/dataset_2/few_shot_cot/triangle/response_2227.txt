Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these.

Calculating the total number of triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
