Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 7

Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[<0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 3, 8>]
