Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 1 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 
[<1, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 7>]
