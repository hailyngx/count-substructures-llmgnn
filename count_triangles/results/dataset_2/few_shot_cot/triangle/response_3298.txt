Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> Form a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: **<0, 4, 17>**

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: **<1, 7, 9>**

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> Form a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: **<2, 5, 15>**

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> Form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: **<3, 7, 16>**
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) -> Form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: **<3, 8, 19>**

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> Form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: **<7, 12, 14>**

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Pair 1: (15, 2) -> Form a triangle with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: **<11, 2, 15>**

* Node 12:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12 as they are smaller than 13.
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15 as they are smaller than 16.
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 18:
    * Node 18 is not connected to any other nodes.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 11) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is **[6]**.
