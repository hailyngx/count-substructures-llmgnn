Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for counting triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (6, 9).
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (6, 1).
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (6, 7).
    * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (6, 0).
    * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (9, 1).
    * Pair 6: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (9, 7).
    * Pair 7: (9, 0) -> Triangle formed using edge (9, 0).
    * Pair 8: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (1, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (3, 11).
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (3, 5).
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (3, 10).
    * Pair 4: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (3, 0).
    * Pair 5: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (3, 12).
    * Pair 6: (11, 5) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (11, 5).
    * Pair 7: (11, 10) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (11, 10).
    * Pair 8: (11, 0) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (11, 0).
    * Pair 9: (11, 12) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (11, 12).
    * Pair 10: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (5, 10).
    * Pair 11: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (5, 0).
    * Pair 12: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (5, 12).
    * Pair 13: (10, 0) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (10, 0).
    * Pair 14: (10, 12) -> Triangle formed using edge (10, 12).
    * Pair 15: (0, 12) -> No triangle formed since there is no edge (0, 12).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, we can find the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed.
