Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 14), but since 6 and 14 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any triangles with nodes smaller than 8 except for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any triangles with nodes smaller than 9 except for Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any triangles with nodes smaller than 10 except for Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any triangles with nodes smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any triangles with nodes smaller than 12 except for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * The only pair we could consider is (9, 3), but since 9 and 3 are both smaller than 13, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any triangles with nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
