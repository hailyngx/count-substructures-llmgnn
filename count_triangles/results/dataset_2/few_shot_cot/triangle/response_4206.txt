Response:
Following the example provided for the previous graph with 15 nodes, we will count the triangles in the graph by analyzing each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) - Both 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 12) - Both 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) - Both 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) - Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9 to 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
