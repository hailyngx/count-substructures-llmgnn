Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 3) -> 12 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (14, 3) -> 14 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 10 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Already counted before as a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 14 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7 were already considered in the previous nodes' calculations.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, and 12 were already considered in the previous nodes' calculations.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and 1 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Already considered in the previous nodes' calculations.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 13) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
[<3, 1, 5>, <3, 1, 14>, <5, 2, 10>, <5, 9, 10>, <5, 9, 2>, <13, 1, 12>, <14, 0, 3>, <14, 0, 12>, <14, 4, 6>]
