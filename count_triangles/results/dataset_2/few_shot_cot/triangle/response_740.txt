Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 18) -> Both 10 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Checking for the 3rd node to form a triangle with 0, 10, and 18.
    * Pair 3: (12, 18) -> Both 12 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Checking for the 3rd node.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> Both 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> Both 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Checking for the 3rd node.
    * Pair 4: (11, 2) -> Both 11 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Checking for the 3rd node.
    * Pair 5: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1. No other pairs to consider for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:

    * Pair 2: (17, 5) -> Both 17 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Checking for the 3rd node.
    * Pair 3: (5, 16) -> Both 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 3: (3, 18) -> Both 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 18) -> Both 5 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Checking for the 3rd node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as there are no pairs involving nodes larger than them.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes. 
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes. 
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 12, 13, and 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes.

    * Pair 2: (12, 15) -> Both 12 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are directly connected. Checking for the 3rd node.
    * Pair 3: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 17:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes. 
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip all possible pairs as they involve smaller nodes. No triangle formed with Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 2 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
