Response:
Following the given example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Already counted when evaluating Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> Already counted when evaluating Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Already counted when evaluating Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 14 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Already counted when evaluating Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
