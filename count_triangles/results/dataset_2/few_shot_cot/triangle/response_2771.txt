Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles formed by each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 1) -> Not a triangle as nodes 3 and 1 are not connected.
    - Pair 2: (3, 18) -> Not a triangle as nodes 3 and 18 are not connected.
    - Pair 3: (3, 19) -> Not a triangle as nodes 3 and 19 are not connected.
    - Pair 4: (3, 6) -> Not a triangle as nodes 3 and 6 are not connected.
    - Pair 5: (1, 18) -> Not a triangle as nodes 1 and 18 are not connected.
    - Pair 6: (1, 19) -> Not a triangle as nodes 1 and 19 are not connected.
    - Pair 7: (1, 6) -> Not a triangle as nodes 1 and 6 are not connected.
    - Pair 8: (18, 19) -> Not a triangle as nodes 18 and 19 are not connected.
    - Pair 9: (18, 6) -> Not a triangle as nodes 18 and 6 are not connected.
    - Pair 10: (19, 6) -> Not a triangle as nodes 19 and 6 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (8, 0) -> Not a triangle as nodes 8 and 0 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (8, 7) -> Not a triangle as nodes 8 and 7 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Not a triangle as nodes 5 and 4 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip all pairs as no node is greater than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue the same process for Nodes 6 to 19.

Finally, calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.
