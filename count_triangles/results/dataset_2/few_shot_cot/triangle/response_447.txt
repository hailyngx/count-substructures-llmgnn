Response:
Following the step-by-step process similar to the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (8, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 22) -> 4 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 22) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 20) -> 4 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 20) -> 22 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 22) -> 4 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 22) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 22) -> 10 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 17) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there are no triangles that can be formed with nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles so far:
* Total triangles = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 4

Continuing the process for the remaining nodes...
