Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (13, 21) -> 13 and 21 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 24) -> 19 and 24 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

* Node 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 21:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Not enough nodes with higher numbers to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 21) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
