Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (3, 0) -> Node 0 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, forming a triangle with (3, 0, 9).
    * Pair 12: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (2, 0) -> Node 2 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0 and 2, forming a triangle with (2, 0, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> Node 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2 and 3, forming a triangle with (3, 2, 7).
    * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Node 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3 and 8, forming a triangle with (8, 9, 3).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are no other nodes larger than 5 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found using each node as the smallest numbered node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [4].
