Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Triangle formed: <1, 3, 10>
    - Pair 2: (5, 20) -> Triangle formed: <1, 5, 20>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Triangle formed: <2, 6, 10>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (10, 2) -> Triangle formed: <2, 6, 10>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now proceeding in a similar manner for the remaining nodes...

[<1, 3, 10>, <1, 5, 20>, <2, 6, 10>]

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
