Response:
Following the method provided in the example for counting triangles, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 26) -> 7 and 26 are connected, but 7 and 26 don't have a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 26) -> 9 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 26) -> 12 and 26 are connected, but 12 and 26 don't have a common neighbor. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 1: (21, 14) -> 21 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 6) -> 21 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 28) -> 12 and 28 are connected, and 12 and 28 have a common neighbor 4 forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 21) -> 2 and 21 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are connected, but 2 and 14 don't have a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 21) -> 1 and 21 are connected, but 1 and 21 don't have a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 23) -> 0 and 23 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 24) -> 1 and 24 are connected, but 1 and 24 don't have a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10-13:
    * Skipped as they are not part of any triangle.

* Node 14:
    * Skipped based on the previous calculations.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are both connected to 15 forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16-19:
    * Skipped based on the previous calculations.

* Node 20:
    * Pair 1: (12, 24) -> 12 and 24 are connected, but 12 and 24 don't have a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 21-23:
    * Skipped based on the previous calculations.

* Node 24:
    * Pair 1: (9, 29) -> 9 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 25-29:
    * Skipped as they are not part of any triangle.

Adding up the triangles from each node:
Total triangles = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 24) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
