Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> Connected to 14 and 18, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 12) -> Connected to 14 and 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 9) -> Connected to 14 and 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 12) -> Connected to 18 and 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (18, 9) -> Connected to 18 and 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 9) -> Connected to 12 and 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> Both 3 and 11 are connected to 1, and 3 and 11 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> Both 3 and 14 are connected to 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> Connected to 3 and 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 14) -> Both 11 and 14 are connected to 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 13) -> Connected to 11 and 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 13) -> Connected to 14 and 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Continue in a similar fashion for Node 2, finding no triangles.

With this process in mind, please proceed to calculate the number of triangles for the remaining nodes (3 to 19) in the graph, providing the total number of triangles in the end within brackets [].
