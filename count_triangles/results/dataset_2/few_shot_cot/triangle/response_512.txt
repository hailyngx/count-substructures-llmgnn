Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs, as there are no nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
