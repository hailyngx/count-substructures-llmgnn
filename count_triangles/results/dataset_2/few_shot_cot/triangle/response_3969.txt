Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (15, 14) -> 15 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No unique triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (0, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 
The list of unique triangles found is as follows: 
<[0, 6, 8], [1, 3, 6], [1, 5, 6], [0, 6, 8], [1, 5, 6]>.

The final answer is [5].
