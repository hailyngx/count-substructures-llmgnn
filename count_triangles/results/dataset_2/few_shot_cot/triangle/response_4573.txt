Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [2].
