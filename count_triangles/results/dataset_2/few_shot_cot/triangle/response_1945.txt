Response:
Following the step-by-step process as detailed in the provided example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with only one node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with only one node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with only one node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
