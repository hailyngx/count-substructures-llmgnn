Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (12, 4) -> 12 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 7) -> 12 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping the pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (12, 7) -> Already counted when considering Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 6: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Continuing in the same manner.
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> 7 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 7) (skipped because it's a repeated pair).
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 1) -> 13 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

I will continue calculating the triangles for nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and onwards. Let's proceed with the calculation.
