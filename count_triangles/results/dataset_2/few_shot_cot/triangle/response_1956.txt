Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Already checked this pair when analyzing Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 2) -> Already checked this pair when analyzing Node 2.
    - Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Already checked this pair when analyzing Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 1) -> Already checked this pair when analyzing Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Already checked this pair when analyzing Node 6.
    - Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Already checked this pair when analyzing Node 4.
    - Pair 3: (9, 3) -> Already checked this pair when analyzing Node 3.
    - Pair 4: (9, 1) -> Already checked this pair when analyzing Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are **11 triangles** in the given graph.

So, the answer in brackets is [11].
