Response:
Following the same process as done in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) in the edge list. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are directly connected as (5, 2) in the edge list. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 0.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not directly connected. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are not directly connected. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 1.
    * Pair 2: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are not directly connected. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 1.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are not directly connected. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are directly connected as (0, 14) in the edge list. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 2.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not directly connected. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 2.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are directly connected as (0, 1) in the edge list. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: No other node to form a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are directly connected as (10, 8) in the edge list. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. 
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with only Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are not directly connected. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (17, 11) -> 17 and 11 are directly connected as (17, 11) in the edge list. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (16, 13) -> 16 and 13 are not directly connected. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10 to Node 19:
    * No triangle formation with Nodes 10 to 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 to 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10 to 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
