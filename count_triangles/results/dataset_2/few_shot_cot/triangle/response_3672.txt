Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 0 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 8, 9>.
The final answer is [7].
