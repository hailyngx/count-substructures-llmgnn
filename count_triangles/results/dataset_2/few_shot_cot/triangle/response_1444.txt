    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:

    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0
