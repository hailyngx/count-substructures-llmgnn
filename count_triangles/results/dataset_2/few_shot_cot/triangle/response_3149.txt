Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 as (0, 2, 17).
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 as (0, 2, 3).
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 as (0, 2, 1).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as (1, 0, 9).
    * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (0, 18) -> No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs containing Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as (2, 8, 5).
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as (2, 8, 16).
    * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as (3, 0, 10).
    * Pair 2: (0, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as (3, 0, 18).
    * Pair 3: (10, 6) -> No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as (4, 6, 13).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs containing Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as (6, 13, 5).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 as (7, 14, 18).
    * No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs containing Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [11].
