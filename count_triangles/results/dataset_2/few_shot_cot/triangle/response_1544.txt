Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Directly connected. Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Directly connected. Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Directly connected. Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Directly connected. Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Directly connected. Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Directly connected. Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Directly connected. Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> Directly connected. Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Directly connected. Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> Directly connected. Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles could be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles could be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles could be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles could be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles could be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles could be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
