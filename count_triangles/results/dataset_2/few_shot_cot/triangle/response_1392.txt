Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Triangle with Node 3 and Node 5: The three nodes (0, 3, 5) form a triangle as they are all connected to each other.
    - No other triangles involving Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - No triangles involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    - Triangle with Node 13 and Node 14: The three nodes (2, 13, 14) form a triangle as they are all connected to each other.
    - No other triangles involving Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Triangle with Node 8 and Node 5: The three nodes (3, 5, 8) form a triangle as they are all connected to each other.
    - No other triangles involving Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - No triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    - No triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    - No triangles involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles involving Node 9.

* Node 10:
    - Triangle with Node 4 and Node 5: The three nodes (4, 5, 10) form a triangle as they are all connected to each other.
    - No other triangles involving Node 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    - Triangle with Node 9 and Node 13: The three nodes (9, 11, 13) form a triangle as they are all connected to each other.
    - No other triangles involving Node 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    - No triangles involving Node 12.

* Node 13:
    - No triangles involving Node 13.

* Node 14:
    - No triangles involving Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 
[<0, 3, 5>, <2, 13, 14>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 10>, <9, 11, 13>]
