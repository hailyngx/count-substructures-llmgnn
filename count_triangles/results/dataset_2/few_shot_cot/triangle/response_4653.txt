Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 27) -> 13 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 13 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 27) -> 16 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 16 and 27 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (23, 24) -> 23 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs available for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs available for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No pairs available for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs available for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for the remaining nodes in the graph, and then calculate the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles found for each node.

Finally, provide the answer inside brackets [] as shown in the example.
