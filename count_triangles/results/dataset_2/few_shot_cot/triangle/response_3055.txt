Response:
Following the same procedure as the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 5: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10:
    - Skipped as they have smaller numbered neighbors and do not form triangles in this iteration.

* Node 11:
    - Skipped as it was already accounted for in the analysis of Node 0.

* Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    - Skipped as it was already accounted for in the analysis of Node 1 and Node 3.

* Node 14:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    - Skipped as there are no 1-hop neighbors with higher node numbers.

* Node 16:
    - Skipped as it was already accounted for in the analysis of Node 0.

* Node 17:
    - Skipped as it was already accounted for in the analysis of Node 0.

* Node 18:
    - Skipped as it was already accounted for in the analysis of Node 2, Node 12, and Node 0.

* Node 19:
    - Skipped as it was already accounted for in the analysis of Node 1 and Node 3.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 14) = 9.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
