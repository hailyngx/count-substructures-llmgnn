Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) - Skipped as both nodes are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) - Skipped as both nodes are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - Skipped as node 5 is smaller than node 4.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) - Skipped as node 9 is smaller than node 4.
    * Pair 5: (4, 14) - Node 4, 14 are directly connected. Skipped as node 14 is smaller than node 4.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) - Node 3, 5 are directly connected. Skipped as both nodes are smaller than node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Node 4, 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) - Node 4, 13 are directly connected. Skipped as both nodes are smaller than node 2.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) - Node 4, 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) - Skipped as both nodes are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) - Node 4, 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No new triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.

Continuing this process for Nodes 6 to 14:

* Node 6:
    * No new triangles can be formed.

* Node 7:
    * No new triangles can be formed.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) - Skipped as 14 is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 2: (12, 5) - Node 12, 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.

* Node 10:
    * No new triangles can be formed.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (13, 4) - Node 13, 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed.

* Node 12:
    * No new triangles can be formed.

* Node 13:
    * No new triangles can be formed.

* Node 14:
    * No new triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
