Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 0, and node 1

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5)  
    * Pair 2: (3, 9)  
    * Pair 3: (5, 9)  
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6)  
    * Pair 2: (5, 9)  
    * Pair 3: (6, 8)  
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8)  
    * Pair 2: (2, 9)  
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6)  
    * Pair 2: (4, 8)  
    * Pair 3: (4, 9)  
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8)  
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 9), but since 4 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 6 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3)  
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

There are no triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [0].
