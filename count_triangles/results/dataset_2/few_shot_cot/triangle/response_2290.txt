Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) 
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) 
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) 
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) 
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles in the given graph:
[1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, and the unique triangle is <4, 7, 9>.
