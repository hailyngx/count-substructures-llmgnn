Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can be considered to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider with nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider with nodes greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
