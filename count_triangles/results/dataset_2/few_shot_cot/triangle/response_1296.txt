Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are directly connected, forming a triangle with 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Already counted under Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6 as (8, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, the output is [9].
