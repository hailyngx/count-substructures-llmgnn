Response:
Following the step-by-step method described in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. One side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 3: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. One side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Same as in the previous steps, we skip this node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. One side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and directly connected. One side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Same as in the previous steps, we skip this node.

* Node 9:
    * Same as in the previous steps, we skip this node.

* Node 10:
    * Same as in the previous steps, we skip this node.

* Node 11:
    * Same as in the previous steps, we skip this node.

* Node 12:
    * Same as in the previous steps, we skip this node.

* Node 13:
    * Same as in the previous steps, we skip this node.

* Node 14:
    * Same as in the previous steps, we skip this node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the output should be: [4].
