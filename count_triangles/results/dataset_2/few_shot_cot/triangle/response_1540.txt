Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 24) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 and Node 24.
    * Pair 2: (5, 27) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 25) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (24, 27) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (24, 25) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (27, 25) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (21, 11) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
* Therefore, there is only 1 triangle in the given graph.

Thus, the final count of unique triangles is [1] in this graph.
