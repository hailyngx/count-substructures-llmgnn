Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 (1, 4) (4, 0) (0, 1) 
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 (4, 7) (7, 0) (0, 4) 
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 (4, 5) (5, 1) (1, 4) 
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 (5, 9) (9, 1) (1, 5) 
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 (5, 9) (9, 1) (1, 5) 
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 (4, 5) (5, 2) (2, 4) 
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 (4, 9) (9, 2) (2, 4) 
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 (5, 9) (9, 2) (2, 5) 
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (9, 6) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 7: (9, 8) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Does not form any triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Does not form any triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 9, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<4, 9, 2>
<4, 7, 0>
<4, 5, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
