Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 21) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 22>, <1, 19, 20>, <2, 12, 24>, <4, 5, 21>, <5, 12, 21>, <15, 18, 27>, <21, 27, 14>. 

The final answer is [8].
