Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the earlier example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Node 1 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - Node 1 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) - Node 1 and Node 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) - Node 1 and Node 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) - Node 4 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 2) - Node 5 and Node 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 3) - Node 5 and Node 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) - Node 5 and Node 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 4) - Node 6 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 9 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Node 5 and Node 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) - Node 5 and Node 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) - Node 5 and Node 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) - Node 5 and Node 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Node 5 and Node 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Node 5 and Node 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
