Response:
Following the example provided earlier, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are connected, but 1 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are connected, but 2 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected, but 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are connected, but 4 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are connected, but 4 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected, and 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are connected, and 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are connected, but 1 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

We will now proceed to count the triangles for the rest of the nodes.

Please give me a moment to complete the calculation.
