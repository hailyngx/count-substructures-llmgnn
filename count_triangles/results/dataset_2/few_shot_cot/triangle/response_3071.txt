Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Sum of triangles from each node) = 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
