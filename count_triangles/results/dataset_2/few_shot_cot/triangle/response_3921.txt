Response:
Following the same approach as the example mentioned earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are not connected because (13, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 23) -> 13 and 23 are not directly connected as there is no edge (13, 23) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are not connected because (14, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 23) -> 14 and 23 are not directly connected as there is no edge (14, 23) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 23) -> 16 and 23 are not connected because (16, 23) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are not directly connected as there is no edge (12, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 24) -> 12 and 24 are directly connected as (12, 24) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are not directly connected as there is no edge (12, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 24) -> 17 and 24 are not directly connected as there is no edge (17, 24) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not directly connected as there is no edge (17, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (24, 19) -> 24 and 19 are directly connected as (24, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Following this process for all the nodes in the graph:

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + ... = [total number of triangles in the graph]

Now, please continue this process for the remaining nodes (2 to 29) and calculate the total number of triangles in the graph by summing up the triangles found for each node. Once you finish, provide the final answer inside brackets [].
