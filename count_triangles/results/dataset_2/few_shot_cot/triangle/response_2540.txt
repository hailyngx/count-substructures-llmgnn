Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 5). Triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 5). Triangle formed.
  - Pair 6: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  - Skipped as all possible pairs include smaller nodes.

* Node 2:
  - Skipped as all possible pairs include smaller nodes.

* Node 3:
  - Skipped as all possible pairs include smaller nodes.

* Node 4:
  - Skipped as all possible pairs include smaller nodes.

* Node 5:
  - Skipped as all possible pairs include smaller nodes.

* Node 6:
  - Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (7, 13). Triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (12, 13) -> Both 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  - Skipped as all possible pairs include smaller nodes.

* Node 8:
  - Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (10, 12) -> Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (10, 12). Triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (11, 12) -> Both 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
  - Skipped as all possible pairs include smaller nodes.

* Node 10:
  - Skipped as all possible pairs include smaller nodes.

* Node 11:
  - Skipped as all possible pairs include smaller nodes.

* Node 12:
  - Skipped as all possible pairs include smaller nodes.

* Node 13:
  - Skipped as all possible pairs include smaller nodes.

* Node 14:
  - Skipped as all possible pairs include smaller nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
