Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (18, 1) -> 18 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (18, 22) -> 18 and 22 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 27) -> 18 and 27 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 4) -> 18 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 20) -> 18 and 20 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (20, 22) -> 20 and 22 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (20, 27) -> 20 and 27 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (20, 4) -> 20 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 23) -> 6 and 23 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (1, 27) -> 1 and 27 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (16, 21) -> 16 and 21 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 25) -> 16 and 25 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 29) -> 16 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (21, 25) -> 21 and 25 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (21, 29) -> 21 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (25, 29) -> 25 and 29 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (25, 24) -> 25 and 24 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (2, 23) -> 2 and 23 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No edges connected to Node 7, therefore, no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 20) -> 11 and 20 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9 to 29:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Nodes 9 to 29) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Output: [2]
