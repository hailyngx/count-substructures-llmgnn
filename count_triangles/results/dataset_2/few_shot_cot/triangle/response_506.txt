Response:
Following the instructed example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as (2, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 11 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 11 are also connected as (6, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 13 are also connected as (1, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 12 are also connected as (4, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 5 are also connected as (2, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 2 and 12 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 11 are also connected as (9, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing the process for the rest of the nodes...

[<0, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 12>, <3, 5, 14>, <3, 9, 11>, <4, 8, 12>, <5, 11, 14>, <6, 10, 14>, <7, 8, 4>, <7, 9, 13>, <9, 10, 6>]

[12, 14, 2, 0, 10, 7, 13, 6, 11, 8, 5, 9, 4, 3, 1]

[12, 14, 2, 0, 10, 7, 13, 6, 11, 8, 5, 9, 4, 3, 1]

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
