Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph are [0].

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
