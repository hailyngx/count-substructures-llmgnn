Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (10, 18) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 19) -> 0 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 28) -> 2 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (23, 0) -> 23 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (23, 0) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 18) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * The node 4 can't form any triangle as there is no other node greater than it to form a triangle.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (5, 16) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (5, 11) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 6 to 29, we get the total number of triangles in the graph.

[<1, 10, 18>, <0, 3, 18>, <5, 11, 16>, <0, 10, 19>, <0, 10, 18>, <3, 18, 21>, <3, 18, 26>, <9, 15, 24>]
