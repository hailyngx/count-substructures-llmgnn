Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 1 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 1 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. 
Finally, the unique triangles found are as follows: 
<8, 0, 25> 
<4, 5, 19> 
<3, 11, 27> 
<1, 15, 18> 
<1, 4, 22> 
<7, 12, 27> 
<12, 13, 24> 
<2, 8, 15>
The answer is [8].
