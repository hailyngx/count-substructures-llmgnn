Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 26) -> Both 14 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (18, 22) -> 18 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (18, 22). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 1 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 1 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are: <10, 15, 8>, <18, 24, 28>, <18, 22, 16>, <20, 6, 3>, and <9, 24, 7>.
The final answer is [5].
