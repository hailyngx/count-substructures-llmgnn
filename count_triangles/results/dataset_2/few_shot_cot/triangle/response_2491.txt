Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0: 
    - Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 12) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Both 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 13) -> Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 10) -> Both 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 3, 4, and 5. Then, summarize the total number of triangles in the graph by adding up the triangles found for each node. Provide the final answer inside brackets [].
