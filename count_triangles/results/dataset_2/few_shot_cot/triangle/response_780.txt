Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with a smaller numbered node.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with a smaller numbered node.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
