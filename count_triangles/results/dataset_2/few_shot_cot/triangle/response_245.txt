Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) - Forms a triangle with Node 13.
    * Pair 2: (10, 15) - Forms a triangle with Node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (2, 18) - Forms a triangle with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) - Forms a triangle with Node 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) - Forms a triangle with Node 21.
    * Pair 2: (16, 21) - Forms a triangle with Node 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 18) - Forms a triangle with Node 25.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) - Forms a triangle with Node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 28) - Forms a triangle with Node 22.
    * Pair 2: (11, 28) - Forms a triangle with Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 29) - Forms a triangle with Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (28, 29) - Forms a triangle with Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (27, 29) - Forms a triangle with Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) - Forms a triangle with Node 25.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (17, 21) - Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (18, 25) - Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) = 17.

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph.
