Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 22) -> 13 and 22 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 28) -> 13 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (22, 28) -> 22 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (22, 11) -> 22 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (28, 11) -> 28 and 11 are connected (28, 18) and (18,1), forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Continue from Node 0 as it has the smallest index.
    * No pair involving Node 1 is greater than Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving Node 0 and Node 1 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 9) -> 16 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (16, 14) -> 16 and 14 are connected (16, 2) and (2, 14), forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (22, 4) -> 22 and 4 are connected (22, 3) and (3, 4), forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (22, 26) -> 22 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 17) -> 22 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 26) -> 4 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (26, 17) -> 26 and 17 are connected (26, 17) and (17, 29), forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 are skipped.
    * No other pairs to consider for triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for each remaining node to find the total number of triangles in the graph.
