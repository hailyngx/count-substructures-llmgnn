Response:
Following the step-by-step process of counting triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 27) -> 5 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 27 are also directly connected as (5, 27) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs with nodes smaller than 2 to consider.
    * No pairs to consider with the remaining nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pair to consider. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs with nodes smaller than 4 to consider.
    * No other pairs to consider with the remaining nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (19, 27) -> 19 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 19 and 27 are also directly connected as (19, 27) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to consider. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs with nodes greater than 7 to consider.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs with nodes greater than 8 to consider.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs with nodes greater than 9 to consider.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 29:
    * Skipped because there aren't enough nodes greater than 10 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the number of triangles in the graph is [2].
