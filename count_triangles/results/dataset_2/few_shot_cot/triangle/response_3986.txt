Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0: Not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <1, 17, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (17, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13: <1, 17, 13>.
    * Pair 3: (17, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 18: <1, 17, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Not part of any triangle, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12: <3, 13, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <1, 10, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Not part of any triangle, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Not part of any triangle, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 7:
    * Not part of any triangle, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 18: <8, 15, 18>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Not part of any triangle, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <1, 10, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 19: <11, 12, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <3, 12, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <1, 13, 17>.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8: <8, 14, 18>.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Not part of any triangle, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <1, 16, 17>.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Not part of any triangle, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8: <8, 18, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:
    * Not part of any triangle, so no triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 18) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 10, 14>, <1, 13, 17>, <1, 16, 17>, <1, 17, 8>, <3, 12, 14>, <8, 14, 18>, <8, 15, 18>, <11, 12, 19>. 

Hence, the final answer is [13].
