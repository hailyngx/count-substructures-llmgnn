Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0)

Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Nodes 3 and 9 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Nodes 5 and 9 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 4, 7>)

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 4, 8>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Nodes 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> Nodes 7 and 2 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * All skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
