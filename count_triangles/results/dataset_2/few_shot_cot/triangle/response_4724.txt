Response:
Following the same approach as the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 10.
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 11.
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 12.
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Node 12.

* Node 13 and Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from Nodes 13 and 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
