Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph step by step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - No triangle formed since 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are connected as in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) - No triangle formed since 2 and 5 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) - 4 and 13 are connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) - 6 and 12 are connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than any of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
