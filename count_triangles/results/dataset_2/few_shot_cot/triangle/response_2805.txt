Response:
Following the same method as the example provided earlier, let's start counting the triangles for each node.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 3) -> Already counted in Pair 1.
    * Pair 7: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 10 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (11, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (14, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 3) -> 11 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Already counted in Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> Already counted in Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (3, 11) -> Already counted in Node 0.
    * Pair 5: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Already counted in Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Already counted in Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> Already counted in Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (10, 11) -> Already counted in Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7 and 8:
    * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than 5, 6, 7 or 8.

* Continuing with Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Already counted in Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 6 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> Already counted in Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 0 (Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
