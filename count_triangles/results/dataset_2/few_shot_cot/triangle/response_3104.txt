Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 1.
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) - Both 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) - Both 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 3
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) - Both 8 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) - Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected as shown in the edges. Triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs of nodes greater than the corresponding node number to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
