Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Nodes 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - Nodes 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) - Nodes 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No pairs remaining to form triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Nodes 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs remaining to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No more pairs remaining to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs can be considered for Node 4 as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - Nodes 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs remaining to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can be considered for Node 6 as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * No more pairs remaining to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be considered for Node 8 as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be considered for Node 9 as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 10:
    * No pairs can be considered for Node 10 as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 11:
    * No pairs can be considered for Node 11 as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 12:
    * No pairs can be considered for Node 12 as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 13:
    * No pairs can be considered for Node 13 as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 14:
    * No pairs can be considered for Node 14 as all potential pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) 
* There are [1] triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer for the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
