Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forming a triangle with node 2.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Forming a triangle with node 0.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> Forming a triangle with node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Forming a triangle with node 8.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Forming a triangle with node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Forming a triangle with node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Forming a triangle with node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Forming a triangle with node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Forming a triangle with node 8.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
