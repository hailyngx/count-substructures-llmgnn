Response:
Following the same method as the previous example, we will count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as (1, 5) is not an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as (1, 7) is not an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as (1, 8) is not an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as (1, 3) is not an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as (3, 5) is not an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Both 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 1 are directly connected as (5, 1) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected as no (5, 8) edge exists. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 as (6, 8) is not an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs of nodes larger than them to create triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
