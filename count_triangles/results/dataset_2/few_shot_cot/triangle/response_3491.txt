Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (25, 28) - These two nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (25, 24) - These two nodes are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (24, 28) - These two nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) - These two nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 22) - These two nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (27, 29) - These two nodes are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 21) - These two nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 28) - These two nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) - These two nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) - These two nodes are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangle can be formed with only one node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for all nodes will enable us to calculate the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed with Nodes 11 to 30.
