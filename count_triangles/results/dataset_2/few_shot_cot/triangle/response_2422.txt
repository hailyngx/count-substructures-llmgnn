Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle can be formed with node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
