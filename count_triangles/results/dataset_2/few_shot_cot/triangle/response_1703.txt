Response:
Following the instruction from the given example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 5: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 7: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 9: (14, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, we find:
    * Node 3: 3 triangles
    * Node 4: 4 triangles
    * Node 5: 0 triangles
    * Node 6: 0 triangles
    * Node 7: 0 triangles
    * Node 8: 0 triangles
    * Node 9: 0 triangles
    * Node 10: 0 triangles
    * Node 11: 0 triangles
    * Node 12: 0 triangles
    * Node 13: 0 triangles
    * Node 14: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
