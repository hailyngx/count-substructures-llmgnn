Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided with step-by-step calculations for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (16, 14) -> This pair has been already calculated in Pair 1. No repetition.
    * Pair 5: (16, 6) -> 16 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 2) -> 16 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pairs involving Node 0 have been previously calculated, so they are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (10, 9) -> 10 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 have been previously calculated, so they are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 9) -> 13 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 9) -> 16 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 have been previously calculated, so they are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  [...]

Continuing this process for all nodes, then sum up the total number of triangles found:
