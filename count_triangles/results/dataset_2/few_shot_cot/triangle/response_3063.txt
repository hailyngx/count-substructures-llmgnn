Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 25) - both 2 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 4, 27>).

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 25) - both 7 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) - 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected directly. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 11, 27>).

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 28) - 6 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected directly. 
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 3.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 15) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
[<1, 4, 27>, <2, 11, 27>, <13, 24, 15>]
