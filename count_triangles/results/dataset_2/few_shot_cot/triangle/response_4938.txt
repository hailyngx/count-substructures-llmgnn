Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (18, 8) -> 18 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 18 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    - No other pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No other pairs to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continue this process for Nodes 3 to 29...
