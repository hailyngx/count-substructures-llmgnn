Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> Directly connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as all other nodes in the graph are greater than Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skipped because Node 0 and Node 1 are smaller than Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skipped because Node 0, 1, and 2 are smaller than Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skipped because Node 0, 1, 2, and 3 are smaller than Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped because Node 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are smaller than Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Skipped because Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are smaller than Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 8, and not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 8, and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 8, and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 10, and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Skipped because Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are smaller than Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 12, and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 12, and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 7) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 12, and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 5) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 12, and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 13, and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 14) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 13, and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 14:
    * Skipped because Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 are smaller than Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 4 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) = 15

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
