Response:
Following the same methodology used in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:  
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node. Total = 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) - 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) - 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle <1, 7, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) - 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle <2, 5, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) - 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle <2, 7, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node. Total = 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node. Total = 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node. Total = 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node. Total = 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node. Total = 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) - 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle <8, 13, 2>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node. Total = 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node. Total = 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) - 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle <11, 14, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (12, 10) - 12 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node. Total = 0

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node. Total = 0

Calculating the total number of triangles by summing up all the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph: [0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14)] = 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
