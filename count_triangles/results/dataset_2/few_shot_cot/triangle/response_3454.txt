Response:
Following the step-by-step method explained in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 13 and 14 are also connected as (13, 14) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (19, 22) -> 19 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 19 and 22 are also connected as (19, 22) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 19) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
