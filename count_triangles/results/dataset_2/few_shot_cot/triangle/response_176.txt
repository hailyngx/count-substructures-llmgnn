Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are connected to node 0, forming a triangle.
        * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> Both 7 and 1 are connected to node 0, forming a triangle.
        * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> Both 7 and 13 are connected to node 0, forming a triangle.
        * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> Both 7 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (14, 1) -> Both 14 and 1 are connected to node 0, forming a triangle.
        * Pair 6: (14, 13) -> Both 14 and 13 are connected to node 0, forming a triangle.
        * Pair 7: (14, 2) -> Both 14 and 2 are connected to node 0, forming a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Due to all pairs involving nodes smaller than 5, no triangles are formed with node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Due to a lack of nodes greater than 9, no triangles are formed with node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 10:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 11:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 12:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 13:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
        * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 14:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
        * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    Summing up the total number of triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0)
    
    [6] 

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
