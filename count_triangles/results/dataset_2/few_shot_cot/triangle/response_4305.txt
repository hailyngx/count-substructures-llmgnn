    * Pair 14: (10, 0) -> 10 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (Triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 6, 12>)

* Node 1:
    * Skipped because all pairs involve nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 4: (14, 2) -> Skipped.
    * Pair 5: (14, 12) -> Skipped.
    * Pair 6: (2, 12) -> Skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <2, 3, 6>)

* Node 4:
    * Skipped because all pairs involve nodes smaller than 4.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
