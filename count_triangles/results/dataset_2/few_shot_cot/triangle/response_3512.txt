Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) and (9, 4).
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 13 are also connected as (7, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Already counted as a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node. No new triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 14 are also connected as (1, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 13 and 14 are also connected as (13, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * No triangles are formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
