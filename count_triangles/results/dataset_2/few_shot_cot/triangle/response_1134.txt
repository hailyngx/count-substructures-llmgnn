Response:
Following the step-by-step process:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are connected as (13, 12) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 13 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected as (6, 12) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 4 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are connected as (4, 12) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 4 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are connected as (10, 14) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 10 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are connected as (9, 11) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 9 and 11. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are connected as (11, 7) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 11 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are connected as (7, 2) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 7 and 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected as (1, 6) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 1 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are connected as (1, 11) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 1 and 11. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are connected as (9, 10) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 9 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are connected as (4, 12) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 11 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least two nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
