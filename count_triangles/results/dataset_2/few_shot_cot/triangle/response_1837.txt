Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles possible as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles possible as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles formed: <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 15>

* Node 3:
    * No triangles possible as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles possible as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (16, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles formed: <3, 5, 12>

* Nodes 6 to 19:
    * Similar to the above process, no triangles are formed with the nodes 6 to 19 as the smallest numbered node. Therefore, the count remains 0 for each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6 to 19) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
