Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) - 9 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * The possible pairs to consider for Node 1 are: (3, 6), (3, 17), (3, 6), (5, 6), (5, 17), (6, 17).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * The possible pairs to consider for Node 2 are: (1, 18), (1, 19), (18, 19).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * The possible pairs to consider for Node 3 are: (14, 1).

    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * The possible pair to consider for Node 5 is: (12, 1).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The possible pairs to consider for Node 6 are: (11, 8), (11, 16), (8, 16).

    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * The possible pairs to consider for Node 8 are: (11, 14), (11, 18), (11, 19), (14, 18).
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The possible pairs to consider for Node 9 are: (12, 14).
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * The possible pair to consider for Node 10 is: (9, 12).
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * The possible pairs to consider for Node 11 are: (6, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) - 10 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * The possible pairs to consider for Node 13 are: (7, 15).
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) - 8 and 18 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * The possible pairs to consider for Node 15 are: (13, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * The possible pair to consider for Node 16 is: (6, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * The possible pair to consider for Node 17 is: (1, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * The possible pairs to consider for Node 18 are: (8, 14), (8, 19).
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No pairs to consider as there is only one connection. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph given is [1].
