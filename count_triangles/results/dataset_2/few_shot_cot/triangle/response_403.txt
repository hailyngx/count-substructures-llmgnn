Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> Form a triangle with Node 2. Triangle <0, 4, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Node 4, 8 are directly connected. Form a triangle with Node 6. Triangle <0, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Node 4, 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 14) -> Node 4, 14 are directly connected. Form a triangle with Node 6. Triangle <0, 4, 14>.
    * Pair 5: (10, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 4. Triangle <0, 10, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 2) -> Node 11, 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> Node 11, 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> Node 2, 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 5) -> Node 11, 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 1) -> Form a triangle with Node 13. Triangle <1, 11, 13>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> Node 5, 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 14. Triangle <3, 7, 12>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> Form a triangle with Node 12. Triangle <3, 7, 14>.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> Form a triangle with Node 7. Triangle <3, 12, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Node 6, 8 are directly connected. Form a triangle with Node 0. Triangle <0, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each node to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
