Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
  * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 3, and 13. <0, 3, 13>
  * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 3, and 2. <0, 3, 2>
  * Pair 4: (4, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 4, and 13. <0, 4, 13>
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
  * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
  * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 2, 0, and 13. <0, 2, 13>
  * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 2, 0, and 3. <0, 2, 3>
  * Pair 4: (0, 11) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 3, 5, and 13. <3, 5, 13>
  * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 3, and 2. <0, 3, 2>
  * Pair 3: (0, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 3, and 13. <0, 3, 13>
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
  * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
  * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
  * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 10:
  * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 11:
  * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 12:
  * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 13:
  * No pair to form a triangle.

* Node 14:
  * No pair to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
