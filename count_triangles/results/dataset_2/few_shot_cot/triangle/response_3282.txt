Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (18, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle with one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangle with two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, and 13:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangle with two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangle with two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangle with two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangle with two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangle with two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangle with one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
