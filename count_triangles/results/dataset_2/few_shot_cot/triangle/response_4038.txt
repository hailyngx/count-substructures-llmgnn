    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Skipping Nodes 11 to 18 as they are not part of any triangles.

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Skipping Nodes 20 to 28 as they are not part of any triangles.

* Node 29:
    * Pair 1: (15, 22) -> 15 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 29, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:  
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 29) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles are <4, 13, 28>, <5, 17, 26>, <7, 0, 22>, <4, 6, 28>, and <9, 17, 11>.
