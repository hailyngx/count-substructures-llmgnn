Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

- Node 0:
    Pair 1: (1, 3) - Not connected
    Pair 2: (0, 6) - Not connected
    Pair 3: (0, 1) - Not connected
    Pair 4: (0, 3) - Not connected

- Node 1:
    Pair 1: (0, 3) - Not connected
    Pair 2: (1, 8) - Not connected

- Node 2:
    Pair 1: (2, 4) - Not connected
    Pair 2: (2, 3) - Not connected
    Pair 3: (2, 6) - Not connected

- Node 3:
    Pair 1: (0, 1) - Not connected
    Pair 2: (2, 4) - Not connected
    Pair 3: (3, 9) - Not connected

- Node 4:
    Pair 1: (0, 1) - Not connected
    Pair 2: (2, 6) - Not connected
    Pair 3: (3, 9) - Not connected

- Node 5:
    No pairs to consider

- Node 6:
    Pair 1: (4, 9) - Not connected

- Node 7:
    Pair 1: (7, 9) - Connected

- Node 8:
    No pairs to consider

- Node 9:
    No pairs to consider

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 7)
[1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
