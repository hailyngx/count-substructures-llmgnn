Response:
Following the same approach as shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3 and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped for the same reason as the previous node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
