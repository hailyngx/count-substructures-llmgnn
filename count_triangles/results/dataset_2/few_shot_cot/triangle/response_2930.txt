Response:
Following the given graph information, we will now count the number of triangles in this graph by examining each node for potential triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) - Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 4, 17>

* Node 1:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No node pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <0, 4, 17>.
