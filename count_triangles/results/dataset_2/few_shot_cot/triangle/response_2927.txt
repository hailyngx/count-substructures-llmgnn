Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (0, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (1, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
