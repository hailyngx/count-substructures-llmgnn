Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0: 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1: 
    * Pair 1: (12, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2: 
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3: 
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 19) -> Node 10, 19, and 3 form a triangle <10, 19, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4: 
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:

    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7: 
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8: 
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9: 
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:

    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11: 
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12: 
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13: 
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14: 
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15: 
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16: 
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17: 
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18: 
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19: 
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
