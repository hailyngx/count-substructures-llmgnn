Response:
Following the step-by-step process detailed in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Connected, 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> Connected, 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 3>
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 3) -> Connected, 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed: <0, 9, 3>
    * Pair 5: (9, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> Connected, 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Connected, 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 6>
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Connected, 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 9>
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> Connected, 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 8>
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> Connected, 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed: <1, 9, 8>
    * Pair 6: (9, 2) -> Connected, 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed: <1, 9, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Connected, 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 3>
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Connected, 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 0>
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) (Repeated) -> Triangle already counted.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Connected, 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed: <3, 2, 5>
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> Connected, 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed: <3, 0, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip as all possible pairs have been explored for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip as all possible pairs have been explored for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Connected, 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed: <6, 4, 9>
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Connected, 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed: <6, 4, 1>
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> Connected, 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed: <6, 9, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Skip as all possible pairs have been explored for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Connected, 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed: <8, 6, 9>
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> Connected, 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed: <8, 6, 1>
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) (Repeated) -> Triangle already counted.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip as all possible pairs have been explored for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 8) = 17.

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph.
