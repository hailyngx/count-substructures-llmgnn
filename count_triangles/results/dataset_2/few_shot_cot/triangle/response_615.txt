Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the previous example to count triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (11, 13) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (11, 2) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (11, 0) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (13, 2) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (13, 0) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (2, 0) -> Node 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> Node 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected as (2, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Node 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Node 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 3, 4, and 5: Skipped as they are not the smallest numbered nodes in the graph for forming triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (10, 2) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (10, 7) -> Node 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (12, 4) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (12, 11) -> Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14: Skipped as they are not the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
