Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) - Both 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) - Both 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 14). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) - Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) - Both 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) - Both 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) - Both 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (0, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 12) - Both 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) - Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) - Both 0 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (0, 13). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) - Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) - Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (5, 13). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 4. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) - Both 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (3, 13). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8 as they are smaller than 6. 
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 9, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 7. 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (6, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) - Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (10, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 and 11 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 12 as it is smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 4 as it is smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 and 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
