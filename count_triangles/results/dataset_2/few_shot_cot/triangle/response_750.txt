Response:
Following the same process as in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected in the edge list. Now, we check their common neighbors to form a triangle. Common neighbors are 4 and 9 connected to both 5 and 7. Triangle formed: <5, 7, 4>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected in the edge list. Now, we check their common neighbors to form a triangle. Common neighbors are 4 and 7 connected to both 5 and 9. Triangle formed: <5, 9, 4>.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected in the edge list. Now, we check their common neighbor to form a triangle. Common neighbor is node 8 connected to both 1 and 9. Triangle formed: <1, 9, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are connected in the edge list. Now, we check their common neighbor to form a triangle. Common neighbor is node 9 connected to both 1 and 8. Triangle formed: <1, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected in the edge list. Now, we check their common neighbor to form a triangle. Common neighbor is node 5 connected to both 9 and 4. Triangle formed: <9, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected in the edge list. Now, we check their common neighbor to form a triangle. Common neighbor is node 5 connected to both 9 and 7. Triangle formed: <9, 7, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are connected in the edge list. Now, we check their common neighbor to form a triangle. Common neighbor is node 1 connected to both 9 and 8. Triangle formed: <9, 8, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are connected in the edge list. Now, we check their common neighbor to form a triangle. Common neighbor is node 7 connected to both 5 and 4. Triangle formed: <5, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Already considered from Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Already considered from Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected in the edge list. Now, we check their common neighbor to form a triangle. Common neighbor is node 5 connected to both 7 and 9. Triangle formed: <7, 9, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Let's continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
