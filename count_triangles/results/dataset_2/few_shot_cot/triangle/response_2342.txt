Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 22) - Node 5 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 28) - Node 5 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 28>.
    * Pair 3: (22, 28) - Node 22 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (25, 14) - Node 25 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 25, 14>.
    * Pair 2: (25, 24) - Node 25 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 24) - Node 14 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 14, 24>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Node 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 16>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 20) - Node 2 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 20, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 21) - Node 2 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Skip, already counted under Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) - Node 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 14) - Node 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 14, 24>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Node 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 8, 24>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 21), but since 5 and 21 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 9:
    * Skipping because there isn't a combination of at least two nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15, 16:
    * Skipping because there isn't a combination of at least two nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

* Node 17, 18:
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19, 20, 21:
    * Skipping because there isn't a combination of at least two nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

* Node 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Total triangles with Nodes 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:

[<0, 5, 28>, <1, 14, 24>, <1, 25, 14>, <2, 3, 16>, <2, 20, 6>, <3, 14, 24>, <4, 8, 24>] 

Therefore, there are 7 unique triangles in the given graph.
