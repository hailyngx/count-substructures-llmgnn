Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 2>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (3, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 2, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (1, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
