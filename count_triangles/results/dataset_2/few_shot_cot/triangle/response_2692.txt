Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (9, 7).
    - Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them.
    - Pair 4: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 2).
    - Pair 3: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 2:**
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 5).
    - Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 14).
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 8).
    - Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 4:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 12).
    - Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 13).
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to count triangles and then sum up the total number of triangles. When you're finished, please provide the final count of triangles in the graph inside brackets [].
