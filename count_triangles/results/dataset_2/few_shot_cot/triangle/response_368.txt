Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 28) - Both 14 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 28 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (14, 29) - Both 14 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 29 are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (28, 29) - Both 28 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 3) - Both 10 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 10 and 3 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (10, 23) - Both 10 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 10 and 23 are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 23) - Both 3 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 27) - Both 4 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 27 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 1 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Similarly, please continue this process for Nodes 4 to 29.

After calculating the triangles for all nodes, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [28].
