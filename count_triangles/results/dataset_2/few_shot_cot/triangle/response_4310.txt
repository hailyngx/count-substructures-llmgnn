This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (5, 8). 
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> Both 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 5). 
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> Both 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 2). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (9, 4). 
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> Both 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 3). 
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> Both 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 1). 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (9, 4). 
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> Both 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 3). 
    * Pair 4: (8, 5) -> Both 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (8, 5). 
    * Pair 5: (8, 7) -> Both 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (8, 7). 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Both 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (5, 1). 
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Both 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (5, 2). 
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (1, 2). 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (5, 9). 
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (5, 7). 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 10.

Therefore, the answer is [10].
