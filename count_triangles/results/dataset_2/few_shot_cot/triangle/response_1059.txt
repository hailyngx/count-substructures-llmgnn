Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as outlined in the previous example: 

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 12 are connected as (2, 12) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 13 are connected as (4, 13) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 11 are connected as (4, 11) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 13 are connected as (5, 13) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 14 are connected as (5, 14) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 12 and 1 are connected as (12, 1) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 8 and 3 are connected as (8, 3) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
            * No triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node due to the lack of at least two nodes greater than the respective node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 10. 

        [There are 10 triangles in the given graph.]
