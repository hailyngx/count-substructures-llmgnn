Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, we will find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Not a triangle because 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Not a triangle because 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - Not a triangle because 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) - Not a triangle because 9 and 11 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) - Not a triangle because 9 and 8 are not connected.
