Response:
Following the same methodology as the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.

            * Pair 2: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        Continue this process for Nodes 6 through 19:

        * Node 6: 
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 7.

        Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
