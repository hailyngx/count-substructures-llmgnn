Response:
Following the process detailed in the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Checking for the third node.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> Both 0 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Checking for the third node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * These nodes will follow the same process as above, excluding pairs with nodes that have a smaller number.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = [Triangular numbers calculated for each node]
* Total number of triangles = [Sum of triangles from all nodes]

Please follow the same process for the remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles in the graph.
