Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are connected as 0 is connected to 7 and 6.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as 0 is connected to 6 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are connected as 1 is connected to 5 and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (11, 3) -> 11 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are connected as 3 is connected to 11 and 2.
    * Pair 3: (16, 2) -> 16 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (16, 0) -> 16 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 19) -> 0 and 19 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 5) -> 10 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 0) -> 10 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue the same process for Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. Finally, sum up the total triangles found for each node.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [18]. 
Unique triangles found during the process:
<3, 11, 16>, <0, 7, 10>, <1, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 16>, <0, 6, 19>, <0, 7, 10>, <0, 9, 19>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 8, 13>, <1, 14, 5>, <2, 3, 11>, <7, 10, 5>, <8, 12, 19>, <8, 13, 17>, <8, 13, 15>, <10, 13, 17>, <16, 3, 11>, <16, 6, 19>.
