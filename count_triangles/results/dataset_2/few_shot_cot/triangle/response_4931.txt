    * Pair 4: (7, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with the remaining nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles with the remaining nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with the remaining nodes.

    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
