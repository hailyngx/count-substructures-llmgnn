Response:
Following the step-by-step process as demonstrated in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (10, 3) -> 10 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 3: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (10, 9) -> 10 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 2: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 3: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 2: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 3: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - No possible triangle with nodes greater than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 3: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 10:
    - No possible triangle with nodes greater than 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    - Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
