Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (9, 6) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 1) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
