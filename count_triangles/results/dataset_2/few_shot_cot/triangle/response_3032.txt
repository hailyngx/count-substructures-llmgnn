Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Already counted in Node 0's evaluation.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (14, 9) -> 14 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Not forming any triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No valid triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Not forming any triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No valid triangles.

* Node 10:
    * Not forming any triangles.

* Node 11:
    * Not forming any triangles.

* Node 12:
    * Not forming any triangles.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No valid triangles.

* Node 14:
    * Not forming any triangles.

* Node 15:
    * Not forming any triangles.

* Node 16:
    * Not forming any triangles.

* Node 17:
    * Not forming any triangles.

* Node 18:
    * Not forming any triangles.

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No valid triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
