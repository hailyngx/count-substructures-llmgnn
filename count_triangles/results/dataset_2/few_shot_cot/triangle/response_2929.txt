Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's move through each node to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (10, 16) -> Both 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (10, 7) -> Both 10 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (10, 7). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (16, 7) -> Both 16 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2: 
    - Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles can be formed with Node 2.

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 13) -> Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

5. Proceed in the same manner for the remaining nodes, and add up the total number of triangles formed with each node as the smallest numbered node.

[Final Answer: The total number of triangles in the given graph is 4, and the unique triangles found are <0, 7, 10>, <3, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 12>, and <3, 5, 13>.]
