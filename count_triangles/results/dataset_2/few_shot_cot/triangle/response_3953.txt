Response:
Following the step-by-step approach mentioned in the first example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph with 30 nodes:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (3, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (8, 0, 11) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Similar computations as previously, remember to skip pairs involving Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Continue this process for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

... Continue this process for all nodes in the graph until Node 29.

Finally, sum up all the triangles found for each node, and output the total number of triangles in the graph within brackets [].
