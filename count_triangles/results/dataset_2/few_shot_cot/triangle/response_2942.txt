Response:
Following the given instructions, let's find the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are directly connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are directly connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 4 are directly connected as (7, 4) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 8 are directly connected as (9, 8) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5 and 6:
  * Since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 5 and 6, we skip these nodes.

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Since there are no pairs to consider, we skip these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
