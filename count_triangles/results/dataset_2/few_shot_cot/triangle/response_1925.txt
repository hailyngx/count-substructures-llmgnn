Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 16) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 10) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (16, 10) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs to avoid nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5
[5] 

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
