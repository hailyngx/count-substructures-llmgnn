Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are connected (1, 0, 4) forming a triangle. <0, 1, 4>
            * No more pairs to consider.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (13, 26) -> 13 and 26 are connected, but there is no third node that connects them, so no triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (13, 0) -> 1 and 0 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
            * No more pairs to consider.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are connected forming a triangle with Node 2. <2, 3, 5>
            * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are connected, but there is no third node that connects them, so no triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (5, 24) -> 5 and 24 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
            * No more pairs to consider.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected forming a triangle with Node 3. <3, 5, 7>
            * Pair 2: (5, 28) -> 5 and 28 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
            * No more pairs to consider.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (17, 27) -> 17 and 27 are connected, but there is no third node that connects them, so no triangle formed.
            * No more pairs to consider.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * No more pairs to consider.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * No more pairs to consider.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (25, 21) -> 25 and 21 are connected forming a triangle with Node 7. <7, 21, 25>
            * Pair 2: (25, 23) -> 25 and 23 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
            * No more pairs to consider.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Continue this process for Nodes 8 to 29.

        [Answer: [1] as there is only one triangle: <0, 1, 4>]
