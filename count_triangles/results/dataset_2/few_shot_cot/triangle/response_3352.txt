Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both one-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 10:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
  - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 11:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
  - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 12:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
  - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 13:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
  - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 14:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
  - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
