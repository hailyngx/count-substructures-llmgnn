Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (0, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 9 and 14 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 13 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 10 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 10 and 19 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 14 and 19 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Nodes 5 to 19 will be processed similarly.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
