Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as (0, 3) and (0, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 12) - Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) - Both 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) - Both 7 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) - Both 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 12) and (3, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) - Both 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5-19:
    * Skipping the other nodes since they are not part of any triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
