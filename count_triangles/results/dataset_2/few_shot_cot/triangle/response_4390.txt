Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are connected as (8, 11). 
    * Pair 4: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other pairs can form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Only one pair that could be considered is (8, 11). 8 and 11 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skip these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than any of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
