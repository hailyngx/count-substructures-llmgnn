    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped due to having at most one node larger than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 8 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
