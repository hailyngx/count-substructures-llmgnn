Response:
Following the method from the example, here is the calculation for the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> No edge between 1 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> Node 1 and 13 are connected, but no edge between 1 and 13. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> Node 1 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 0) -> Node 1 and 0 are connected, and there is an edge between them as (0, 1). Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No edge between nodes 7 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> Node 7 and 13 are connected, but no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> Node 7 and 0 are connected, and they have an edge between them as (0, 7). Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs with nodes smaller than Node 2 are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Node 4 and 9 are connected, but no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> Node 4 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 16) -> Node 4 and 16 are connected, and there is an edge between them as (16, 4). Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No connections to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 19) -> No edge between nodes 0 and 19. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> Node 0 and 13 are connected, but no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 12) -> Node 0 and 12 are connected, and there is an edge between them as (0, 12). Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> No edge between nodes 1 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> No edge between nodes 0 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
