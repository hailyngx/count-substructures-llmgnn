Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided:

Starting the process of counting the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 18 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 9) -> 12 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 9) -> 18 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Since Node 8 is not connected to any other node, no triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9
* Triangles:
[<5, 7, 2>, <9, 4, 13>, <5, 15, 3>, <4, 6, 14>, <7, 12, 0>, <10, 15, 3>, <9, 10, 15>, <9, 13, 19>, <12, 18, 2>]
