Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (2, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (8, 15) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (8, 2, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (5, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (5, 10) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (8, 18) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (3, 5, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (7, 6, 17) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (18, 9) -> 18 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (18, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (15, 2) -> 15 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (15, 2, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 8) -> 15 and 8 are not considered for pair as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (12, 9, 19) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 1) -> 13 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected as (13, 1, 10) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* The calculations for Nodes 11 to 19 are as follows:
    * Node 11 => 0 triangles
    * Node 12 => 1 triangle
    * Node 13 => 0 triangles
    * Node 14 => 0 triangles
    * Node 15 => 1 triangle
    * Node 16 => 0 triangles
    * Node 17 => 1 triangle
    * Node 18 => 1 triangle
    * Node 19 => 1 triangle

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 15

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [15].
