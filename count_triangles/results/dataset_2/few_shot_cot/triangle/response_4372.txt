Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1**:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2**:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3**:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4**:
    * No triangles involving Node 4 as all its neighbors are reachable in 2 hops.

6. **Node 5**:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. **Node 6**:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles involving Node 6 as all its other neighbors are reachable in 2 hops.

8. **Node 7**:
    * No triangles involving Node 7 as both its neighbors are reachable in 1 hop.

9. **Node 8**:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. **Node 9**:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. **Node 10**:
    * No triangles involving Node 10 as all its neighbors are reachable in 1 or 2 hops.

12. **Node 11**:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

13. **Node 12**:
    * No triangles involving Node 12 as all its neighbors are reachable in 1 or 2 hops.

14. **Node 13**:
    * No triangles involving Node 13 as all its neighbors are reachable in 1 or 2 hops.

15. **Node 14**:
    * No triangles involving Node 14 as both its neighbors are reachable in 1 hop.

Adding up the triangles from each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 11) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 0, 2>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 8, 11>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 1, 6>
<8, 5, 11>
<9, 13, 7>
