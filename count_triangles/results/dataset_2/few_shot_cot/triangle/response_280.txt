Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (26, 29) -> 26 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 26) -> 11 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 0, as 0 is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 20) -> 4 and 20 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 26) -> 4 and 26 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13:
    * Skipping these nodes as they have smaller numbered nodes already covered.

* Node 14:
    * Skipping as Node 14 is already covered.

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes in the graph, we find the number of triangles as follows:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 9

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
