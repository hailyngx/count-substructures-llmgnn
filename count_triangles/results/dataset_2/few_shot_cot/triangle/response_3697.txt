Response:
Following the method described in the original example for counting triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Form a triangle <0, 1, 4>
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Form a triangle <0, 1, 5>
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Form a triangle <0, 1, 7>
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Form a triangle <0, 4, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Form a triangle <1, 2, 3>
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Form a triangle <1, 2, 7>
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Form a triangle <1, 3, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Form a triangle <2, 3, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Form a triangle <3, 4, 9>
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Form a triangle <3, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Form a triangle <4, 5, 6>
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Form a triangle <4, 5, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No additional triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No additional triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
  
* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Form a triangle <7, 0, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with 2-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 8: 0

* Node 9:
    * No additional triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles: 
Total triangles = 4 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
