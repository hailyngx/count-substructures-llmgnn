Response:
Following the step-by-step counting of triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 9, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
