Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 (1, 8, 5).
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10 (10, 13, 5).
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 (0, 8, 5).
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10 (4, 6, 10).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11 (5, 14, 11).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10 (8, 6, 10).
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 (0, 8, 5).
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10 (0, 13, 5).
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2 

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (4, 6, 10).
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 (0, 8, 5).
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10 (0, 13, 5).
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2 

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 10:
    * For all pairs with smaller nodes, triangles are counted above.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 11:
    * For all pairs with smaller nodes, triangles are counted above.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 12:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10 (0, 13, 5).
    * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10 (4, 6, 10).
    * Pair 4: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
