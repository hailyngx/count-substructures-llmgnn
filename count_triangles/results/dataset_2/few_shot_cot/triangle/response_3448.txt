Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Node 1-9-0 forms a triangle. Triangle: <0, 1, 9>
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> Node 1-9-0 forms a triangle. Triangle: <0, 1, 9>
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. Let's represent the triangles found: [<0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 9>].

The final answer is [2].
