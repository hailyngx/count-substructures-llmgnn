Response:
Following the method shown in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 13.
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 13) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

[<0, 3, 7>, <8, 13, 12>, <8, 13, 14>]
