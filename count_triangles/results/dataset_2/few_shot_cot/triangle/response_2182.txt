* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (12, 10) - Both 12 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 12, and 12 and 10 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
