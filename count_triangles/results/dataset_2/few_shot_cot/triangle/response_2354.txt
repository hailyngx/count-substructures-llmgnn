Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 25) -> Both 4 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 25 are directly connected as (4, 25) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 21) -> Both 4 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 21 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 21) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 16) -> Both 21 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 21 and 16 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 16 are also connected as 5 and 16 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (14, 27) -> 14 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 14 and 27 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as 13 and 16 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 10 to 29:
* Node 10: 0 triangles.
* Node 11: 0 triangles.
* Node 12: 0 triangles.
* Node 13: 1 triangle.
* Node 14: 0 triangles.
* Node 15: 0 triangles.
* Node 16: 1 triangle.
* Node 17: 0 triangles.
* Node 18: 0 triangles.
* Node 19: 0 triangles.
* Node 20: 0 triangles.
* Node 21: 0 triangles.
* Node 22: 0 triangles.
* Node 23: 0 triangles.
* Node 24: 0 triangles.
* Node 25: 0 triangles.
* Node 26: 0 triangles.
* Node 27: 0 triangles.
* Node 28: 3 triangles.
* Node 29: 0 triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found for each smallest node:
* Total triangles: 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 3 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 8 triangles.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Output: [8]
