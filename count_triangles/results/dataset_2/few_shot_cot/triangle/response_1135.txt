Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (26, 28) -> 26 and 28 are directly connected and also 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (26, 9) -> 26 and 9 are directly connected and also 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 3) -> 26 and 3 are directly connected but not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (28, 9) -> 28 and 9 are directly connected and also 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (28, 3) -> 28 and 3 are directly connected but not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 since it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (22, 14) -> 22 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (17, 10) -> 17 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * ...

Continue this process for all remaining nodes, listing the pairs forming triangles for each node and adding up the total triangles formed. 

Finally, output the final answer inside brackets [], listing the unique triangles found inside <> each only once.
