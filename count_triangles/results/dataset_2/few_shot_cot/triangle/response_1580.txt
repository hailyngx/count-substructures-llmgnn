Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed as 11 and 14 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (11, 8) -> No triangle formed as 11 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (14, 8) -> No triangle formed as 14 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (16, 2) -> No triangle formed as 16 and 2 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 17 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> No triangle formed as 11 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 17) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> No triangle formed as 15 and 17 are not connected.

    * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed as 12 and 13 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 9 are not connected.

    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> No triangle formed as 15 and 17 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 10.

* Node 11:

* Node 14:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 17 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (19, 13) -> No triangle formed as 19 and 13 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 18.

* Node 19:

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
