Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
        * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
        * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Both 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (13, 17) -> Both 13 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> Both 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (16, 1) -> Both 16 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

    * Node 10:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

    * Nodes 11 to 19:
        * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 11 to 19 since there are not at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
