Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's connections:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (3, 14) - Forms a triangle with Node 23 as (3, 14, 23).
    - Pair 2: (3, 16) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (3, 23) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 4: (14, 16) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 5: (14, 23) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 6: (16, 23) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (3, 17) - Forms a triangle with Node 29 as (3, 17, 29).
    - Pair 2: (3, 29) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (3, 13) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 4: (17, 29) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 5: (17, 13) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 6: (29, 13) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**
    - Since Node 2 only has connections to Node 12, it cannot form any triangles.

4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (1, 0) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (1, 22) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (0, 22) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
    - Pair 1: (22, 25) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
    - Since Node 5 only has connections to Node 20 and Node 8, it cannot form any triangles.

7. **Node 6:**
    - Pair 1: (27, 25) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (27, 19) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (25, 19) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    - Pair 1: (18, 25) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
    - Pair 1: (5, 16) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - Pair 1: (27, 21) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (27, 10) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (21, 10) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. **Node 10:**
    - Pair 1: (18, 29) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. **Node 11:**
    - Pair 1: (29, 19) - Does not form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. **Node 12:**
    - Since Node 12 only has connections to Node 27, it cannot form any triangles.

Continuing this process for all nodes in the graph, and summing up the total number of triangles formed, we will find the final answer. Let's proceed in the same manner for the remaining nodes.
