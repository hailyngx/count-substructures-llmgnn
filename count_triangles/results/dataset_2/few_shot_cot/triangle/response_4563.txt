Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any nodes smaller than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are directly connected as (2, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (5, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are directly connected as (5, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (6, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are directly connected as (6, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (10, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any nodes smaller than 10.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any nodes smaller than 11.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any nodes smaller than 12.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any nodes smaller than 13.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any nodes smaller than 14.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
