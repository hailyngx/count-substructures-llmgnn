Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (23, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (23, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (23, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (23, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (23, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (28, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (28, 24) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 24) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 22) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 22) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (12, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (22, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (22, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (25, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Nodes 5, 6, 7:
    - Skipped due to no possible triangle formation.

7. Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (14, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Nodes 10 to 29:
    - Skipped due to no possible triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
