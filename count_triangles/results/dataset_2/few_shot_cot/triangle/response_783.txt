Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 3 are also connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 10 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 5 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing the process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 12 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 10 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as each of them does not have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
