Response:
Proceeding with the process of counting triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 23) -> 12 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 23 are also connected as (12, 0, 23) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as both nodes in the pair are smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (27, 28) -> 27 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 27 and 28 are not directly connected as there is no edge (27, 28) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as both nodes in the pair are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 19 are also connected as (1, 4, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 29) -> 4 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 29 are also connected as (4, 29) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 11 and 15 are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 15) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 17 are also connected as (5, 17) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as the node in the pair is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 7 and 18 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 18) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 20) -> 8 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 8 and 20 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 20) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 19 are also connected as (9, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 22) -> 9 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 9 and 22 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 22) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29: 
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

* Node 24:
    * No pairs possible as Node 24 is not connected to any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
