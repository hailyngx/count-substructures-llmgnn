Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
