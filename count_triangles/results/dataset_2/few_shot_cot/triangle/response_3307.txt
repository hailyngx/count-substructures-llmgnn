Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (19, 23) -> 19 and 23 are directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 20) -> 1 and 20 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 21) -> 1 and 21 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 28) -> 1 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 29) -> 7 and 29 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are directly connected. 
    * Pair 2: (8, 23) -> 8 and 23 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 29) -> 8 and 29 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3
* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 25) -> 9 and 25 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Since the graph has a total of 30 nodes, we will continue examining the remaining nodes in a similar manner to count the number of triangles efficiently. Let's continue this process for Nodes 10, 11, and 12 through 29.
