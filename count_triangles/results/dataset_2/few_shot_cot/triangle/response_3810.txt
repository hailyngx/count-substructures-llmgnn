Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 10), but since 7 is smaller than 10, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
