Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0)

Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 0

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected in the edge list as (4, 6). 
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected in the edge list as (1, 6).
  * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected in the edge list as (5, 8). 
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected in the edge list as (0, 4).
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * The only pair we could consider is (0, 5), but since 0 and 5 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * The only pair we could consider is (0, 9), but since 0 and 9 are both smaller than 8, this pair is skipped.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Skipped because there isn't at least another node greater than 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
