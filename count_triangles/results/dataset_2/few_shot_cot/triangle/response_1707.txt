Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 27) -> 5 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 28) -> 3 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it's not connected to any other nodes.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 29) -> 9 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 25) -> 9 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 25) -> 10 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Skipping nodes 11 to 19 for now as they are next in line.

* Node 20:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes smaller than 20.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 21:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 21.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node.

* Skipping nodes 22 to 29 for now as they are next in line.

Now let's continue with nodes 11 to 19.
