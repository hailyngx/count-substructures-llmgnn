Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
    - <16, 17, 0> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 1) connected to each other.

3. Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 2) connected to each other.

4. Node 3:
    - <8, 13, 3> forms a triangle.
    - <3, 14, 26> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 4) connected to each other.

6. Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 5) connected to each other.

7. Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 6) connected to each other.

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 7) connected to each other.

9. Node 8:
    - <4, 8, 23> forms a triangle.
    - <23, 8, 13> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

10. Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 9) connected to each other.

11. Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 10) connected to each other.

12. Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 11) connected to each other.

13. Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 13) connected to each other.

16. Node 16:
    - <16, 18, 0> forms a triangle.
    - <16, 17, 0> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 2

17. Node 17:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 17) connected to each other.

18. Node 18:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 18) connected to each other.

19. Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 19) connected to each other.

20. Node 20:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 20) connected to each other.

21. Node 21:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 21) connected to each other.

22. Node 22:
    - <22, 15, 20> forms a triangle.
    - <22, 20, 21> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 2

23. Node 23:
    - <23, 8, 13> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 1

24. Node 24:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 24) connected to each other.

25. Node 25:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 25) connected to each other.

26. Node 26:
    - <26, 21, 17> forms a triangle.
    - <26, 21, 5> forms a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 2

27. Node 27:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 27) connected to each other.

28. Node 28:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 28) connected to each other.

29. Node 29:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no two nodes (besides Node 29) connected to each other.

Calculating the total number of triangles by adding up the triangles found for each node:
Total triangles = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
