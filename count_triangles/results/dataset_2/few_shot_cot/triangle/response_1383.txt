Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since no pair forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since no pair forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since no pair forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) - Forms a triangle with Node 12: <3, 6, 15>.
    * Pair 2: Skipped since no additional pairs form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since no pair forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since no pair forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since one of the nodes is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since one of the nodes is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since no pair forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) - Forms a triangle with Node 2: <2, 4, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since no pair forms a triangle with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since one of the nodes is smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since one of the nodes is smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since one of the nodes is smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) - Forms a triangle with Node 16: <14, 15, 16>.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since one of the nodes is smaller than 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since no pair forms a triangle with Node 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since one of the nodes is smaller than 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since one of the nodes is smaller than 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: Skipped since no pair forms a triangle with Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph: [2] (<3, 6, 15>, <2, 4, 13>)

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
