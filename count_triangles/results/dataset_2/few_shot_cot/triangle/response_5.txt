Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <3, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <3, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
