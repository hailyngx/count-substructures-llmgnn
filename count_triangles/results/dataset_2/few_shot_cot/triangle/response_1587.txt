Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected in the edge list.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected in the edge list.

    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
