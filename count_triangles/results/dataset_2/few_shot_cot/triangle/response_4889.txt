Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) - 4 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) - 1 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 15) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes with smaller values.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least two nodes with higher values to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8-19) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
