Response:
Following the technique explained in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Now, moving on to Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 4:
    * The only possible triangle has been considered already. No other triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and 9:
    * Skip as there isn't a pair of nodes greater than 8 and 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 4, 0>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 0, 3>, <2, 0, 9>, <2, 0, 2>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 0, 9>, <3, 2, 7>, <3, 2, 9>  

The final answer is [12].
