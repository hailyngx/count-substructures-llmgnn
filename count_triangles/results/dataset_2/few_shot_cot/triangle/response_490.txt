Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangle can be formed as it has only one connection.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Nodes 5 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> Nodes 5 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 19) -> Nodes 13 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 18) -> Nodes 5 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 18) -> Nodes 13 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (19, 18) -> Nodes 19 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed as it has only two connections.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> Nodes 7 and 14 are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> Nodes 9 and 14 are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Nodes 7 and 14 are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> Nodes 7 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> Nodes 10 and 14 are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Nodes 10 and 14 are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) -> Nodes 10 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> Nodes 11 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (17, 13) -> Nodes 17 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 8) -> Nodes 17 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 8) -> Nodes 13 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
