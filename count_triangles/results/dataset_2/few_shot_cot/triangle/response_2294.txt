Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than any of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [5].
