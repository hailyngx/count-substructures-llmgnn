Response:
Following the method shown in the example, we will find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 23) -> 4 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 23 are connected as (4, 23) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 20) -> Both 12 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (21, 27) -> 21 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (21, 27) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 24) -> 7 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 24) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (20, 28) -> 20 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (13, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (24, 1) -> 24 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (24, 1) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (18, 14) -> 18 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (18, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 3) -> 13 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as (13, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Let's continue this process for the rest of the nodes in the graph.
