Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Skipped because 3 is smaller than 5.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Skipped because 3 is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Skipped because 3 is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Skipped because 5 is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> Skipped because 5 is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Skipped because 6 is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 7: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> Skipped because 7 is smaller than 12.
    * Pair 4: (7, 14) -> Skipped because 7 is smaller than 14.
    * Pair 5: (12, 14) -> Skipped because 12 is smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5.

* Node 2:
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, proceed with the remaining nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Carry out the same process and identify the triangles formed by each node. Finally, count the total number of triangles in the graph and provide the answer inside brackets [].
