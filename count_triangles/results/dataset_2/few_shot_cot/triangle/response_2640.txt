Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

Node 0:
- Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
- Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 1:
- Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = [9]

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
