Response:
Following the process described in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 19) -> 0 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs for Node 1, as there are no more nodes greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 29) -> 4 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 29 are also connected as (4, 29) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 22) -> 5 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 22 are also connected as (5, 22) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 29) -> 4 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 29 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for Nodes 5 to 29, and summing up the total number of triangles, we get:

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
