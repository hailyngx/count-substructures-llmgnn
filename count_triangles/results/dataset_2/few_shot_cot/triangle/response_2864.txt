Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> Both 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 0) and (14, 0) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (1, 13) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Since Node 4 only has one neighbor (Node 8), there are no triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (5, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 6:
    * Node 6 has multiple triangles as mentioned for Node 5 (symmetric property of the edge set). No new triangles formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Node 7 has multiple triangles as mentioned for Node 5 and Node 3. Also, (7, 1) forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Node 8 has triangles mentioned for Node 1 and Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (9, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10 to 14:
    * Skipping Nodes 10 to 14 as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles following the process.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.
