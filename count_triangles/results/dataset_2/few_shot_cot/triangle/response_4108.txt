Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 3) -> 16 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are directly connected. No third node connects them to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are directly connected. No third node connects them to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are directly connected. No third node connects them to form a triangle.

    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are directly connected. No third node connects them to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
