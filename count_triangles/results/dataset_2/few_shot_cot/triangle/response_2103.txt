Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Form a triangle with 3 and 8 as they share a connection: 0 -> 3 -> 8 -> 0. Triangle <0, 3, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 14 do not have a direct connection.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 10 do not have a direct connection.
    * Pair 4: (3, 11) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 11 do not have a direct connection.
    * Pair 5: (8, 14) -> Form a triangle with 8 and 14 as they share a connection: 0 -> 8 -> 14 -> 0. Triangle <0, 8, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Form a triangle with 4 and 7 as they share a connection: 2 -> 4 -> 7 -> 2. Triangle <2, 4, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> Form a triangle with 0 and 14 as they share a connection: 3 -> 0 -> 14 -> 3. Triangle <3, 0, 14>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 13 do not have a direct connection.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> Form a triangle with 3 and 6 as they share a connection: 3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3. Triangle <3, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 4: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 13 do not have a direct connection.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Form a triangle with 8 and 9 as they share a connection: 4 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4. Triangle <4, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Form a triangle with 7 and 11 as they share a connection: 6 -> 7 -> 11 -> 6. Triangle <6, 7, 11>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 10 do not have a direct connection.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> Form a triangle with 5 and 2 as they share a connection: 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 5. Triangle <5, 2, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> No triangle formed as 10 and 11 do not have a direct connection.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * There are no pairs with nodes higher than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
