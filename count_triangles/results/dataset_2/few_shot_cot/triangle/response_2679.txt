Response:
Following the same process as explained in the example above to find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (20, 5) -> 20 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (20, 29) -> 20 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 3: (20, 27) -> 20 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 4: (20, 10) -> 20 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (20, 13) -> 20 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 29) -> 15 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (15, 10) -> 15 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (29, 10) -> 29 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 6:
    * Skipping these nodes as there are smaller numbered nodes to consider.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 12) -> 15 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 to 16:
    * Skipped due to smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (14, 29) -> 14 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 17, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 17, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (17, 29) -> 17 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 18, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (17, 9) -> 17 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 18, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 11) -> 17 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 18, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19 to Node 28:
    * Skipped due to smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 29:
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) -> 0 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 29, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 29, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 18) -> 0 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 29, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 29) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [7].
