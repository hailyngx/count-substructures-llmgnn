Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2)

Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 and Node 6.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 and Node 8.
    - Pair 3: (5, 2) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 and Node 2.
    - Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 6 and Node 7.
    - Pair 5: (7, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 7 and Node 8.
    - Pair 6: (7, 2) -> Form a triangle with Node 7 and Node 2.
    - Pair 7: (2, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 2 and Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 1:
    - All possible pairs involve nodes smaller than Node 1, so no triangles form.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - All possible pairs involve nodes smaller than Node 2, so no triangles form.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Form a triangle with Node 4 and Node 6.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 4 and Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - All possible pairs involve nodes smaller than Node 4, so no triangles form.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - All possible pairs involve nodes smaller than Node 5, so no triangles form.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - All possible pairs involve nodes smaller than Node 6, so no triangles form.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - No pairs to form a triangle with nodes greater than Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - No pairs to form a triangle with nodes greater than Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - No pairs to form a triangle with nodes greater than Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
