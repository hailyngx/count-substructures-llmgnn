Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (5, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (3, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6:
    * Following the same process as above, calculate the triangles for nodes 4, 5, and 6.

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Continue calculating triangles for nodes 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also directly connected as (5, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Complete the triangle count for the remaining nodes following the same procedure.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = [Total number of triangles found for each node as the smallest numbered node].
* Total triangles in the graph = [1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + X (Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14)].
* Total triangles in the graph = [6 + X].

Please complete the calculations for the remaining nodes (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14) to find X and the total number of triangles in the graph. When ready, provide the final answer enclosed in brackets.
