Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned earlier, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - No triangles found with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

2. **Node 1**:
    - Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 6) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - No triangles found with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. **Node 2**:
    - Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - No triangles found with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. **Node 3**:
    - Pair 1: (7, 0) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (7, 6) -> Connected in the edge list as (7, 6).
    - Pair 3: (0, 6) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - No triangles found with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. **Node 4**:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Connected in the edge list as (5, 6).
    - Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (6, 2) -> Connected in the edge list as (6, 2).
    - Unique triangle found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 5, 6>.

6. **Node 5**:
    - No more nodes to consider for triangle formation with Node 5.

7. **Node 6**:
    - Skip calculation for Node 6, as it has already been considered in triangles with other nodes.

8. **Node 7**:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (9, 3) -> Not connected in the edge list.
    - No triangles found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. **Node 8**:
    - No more nodes to consider for triangle formation with Node 8.

10. **Node 9**:
    - No more nodes to consider for triangle formation with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].

The unique triangle found is <4, 5, 6>.
