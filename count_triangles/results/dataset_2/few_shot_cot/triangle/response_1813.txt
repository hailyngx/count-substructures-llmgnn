Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example mentioned earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 7) -> 10 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3 and 5 as they are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 5, 9, 10, 12, and 15 as they are greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with larger nodes 6, 16, and 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with larger nodes 15 and 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with larger nodes 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all as every node is greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with larger nodes 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with larger nodes 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with larger nodes 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with larger nodes 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No more nodes greater than 13 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with larger nodes 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No more nodes greater than 15 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
