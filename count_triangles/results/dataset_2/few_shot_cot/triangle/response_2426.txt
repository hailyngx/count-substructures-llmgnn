Response:
Following the same steps as in the example provided earlier to find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 24.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 24) -> Triangle formed with Node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 21) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (14, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (14, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No triangles formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (16, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (12, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * No triangles formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (3, 24) -> Triangle formed with Node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (17, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (18, 22) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19, Node 20, Node 21, Node 22, Node 23, Node 24, Node 25, Node 26, Node 27, Node 28, Node 29:
    * Skipped as all remaining nodes have smaller numbers and cannot form triangles as the smallest numbered node in the triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 3) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 15) + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are <3, 9, 24> and <3, 15, 24>.

Hence, the final answer is [2].
