Response:
Following the same steps as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Other possible pairs with 0 are either not connected or have nodes smaller than 0. No more triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Other possible pairs with 1 have nodes smaller than 1. No more triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangle found with 2 as the smallest node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Other possible pairs with 3 have nodes smaller than 3. No more triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangle found with 4 as the smallest node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangle found with 5 as the smallest node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangle found with 6 as the smallest node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangle found with 7 as the smallest node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Other possible pairs with 8 have nodes smaller than 8. No more triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangle found with 9 as the smallest node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * No triangle found with 10 as the smallest node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * No triangle found with 11 as the smallest node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * No triangle found with 12 as the smallest node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * No triangle found with 13 as the smallest node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * No triangle found with 14 as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [0].
