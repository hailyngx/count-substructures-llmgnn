Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes larger than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles possible as it has no 2-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes larger than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 2) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 10>.
    * Pair 7: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (14, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (14, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (2, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles possible as it has no 2-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles possible as it has no 2-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes larger than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes larger than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes larger than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles possible as it has no 2-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes larger than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No triangles possible as it has no 2-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes larger than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph identified as <2, 4, 10>.

The final answer is [1].
