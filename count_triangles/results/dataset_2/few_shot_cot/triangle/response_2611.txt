Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 21) -> Nodes 1 and 21 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 18) -> Nodes 1 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 21) -> Nodes 18 and 21 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Nodes 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 20) -> Nodes 5 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 22) -> Nodes 5 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 22) -> Nodes 20 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Nodes 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Nodes 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (22, 6) - Nodes 22 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 28) - Nodes 22 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) - Nodes 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 26) - Nodes 1 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Others) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Finally, the triangles found are:
[<4, 1, 5>, <5, 22, 6>, <5, 22, 28>, <9, 8, 6>, <1, 26, 7>, <1, 5, 4>, <18, 28, 5>, <20, 2, 5>].
