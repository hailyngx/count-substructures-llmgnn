Response:
Following the same process as explained in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> Both 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 21) -> Both 8 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 21) -> Both 18 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (21, 18) shown in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 24) -> Both 4 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 28) -> Both 4 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (4, 28) shown in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Already considered above.
    * Pair 5: (4, 23) -> Both 4 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 28) -> Both 15 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (15, 28) shown in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (15, 29) -> Both 15 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (15, 29) shown in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 3: (28, 29) -> Both 28 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 29) -> Both 6 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (17, 28) -> Both 17 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as (17, 28) shown in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (17, 5) -> Both 17 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 28) -> Already considered above.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already considered (1, 2, 4).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (21, 26) -> Both 21 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (21, 26) shown in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (21, 7) -> Already considered above.
    * Pair 3: (21, 20) -> Both 21 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (21, 23) -> Both 21 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already considered (0, 1).
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Only one potential triangle with available pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (17, 23) -> Both 17 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also connected as (17, 23) shown in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 11 to 29:
    * Skipped due to fewer than 2 nodes having a greater number.

Summing up the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
