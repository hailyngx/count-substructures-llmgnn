Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (21, 28) - 21 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (21, 28) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (21, 4) - 21 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 4) - 28 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (28, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 6) - 15 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles as there are not at least two other nodes greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (25, 6) - 25 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (25, 27) - 25 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (25, 27) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 27) - 6 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 27) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 2: (26, 10) - 26 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 0) - 26 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 21) - 3 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) - 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (3, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (21, 14) - 21 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) - 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (1, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 27) - 1 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 27) - 13 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 7 to 29:

* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 1 triangle
* Node 11: 2 triangles
* Node 12: 1 triangle
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 1 triangle
* Node 16: 1 triangle
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 1 triangle
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 0 triangles
* Node 22: 2 triangles
* Node 23: 0 triangles
* Node 24: 2 triangles
* Node 25: 2 triangles
* Node 26: 1 triangle
* Node 27: 2 triangles
* Node 28: 1 triangle
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Summing up the triangles from all nodes:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 2 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 2 (Node 24) + 2 (Node 25) + 1 (Node 26) + 2 (Node 27) + 1 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 23.

Therefore, there are 23 triangles in the given graph.
