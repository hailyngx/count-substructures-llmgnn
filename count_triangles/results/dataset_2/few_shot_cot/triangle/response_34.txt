Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 21) -> 7 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 12) -> 21 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (20, 26) -> 20 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (20, 13) -> 20 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 22) -> 20 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (20, 11) -> 20 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (20, 14) -> 20 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10:
    * Skipped as they have smaller numbered nodes for forming triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15:
    * Skipped as they have smaller numbered nodes for forming triangles.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (19, 22) -> 19 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 16, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 17, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22:
    * Skipped as they have smaller numbered nodes for forming triangles.

* Node 23:
    * Pair 1: (25, 23) -> 25 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 23, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (29, 23) -> 29 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 23, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
    * Skipped as they have smaller numbered nodes for forming triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 2 (Node 23) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
