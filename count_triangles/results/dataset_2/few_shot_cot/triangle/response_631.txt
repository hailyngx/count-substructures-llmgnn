Response:
Following the instructions provided in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the graph using the given information. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 10) - Both 16 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 17) - Both 16 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node <0, 16, 17>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) - Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node <1, 5, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) - Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 17) - Both 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 13) - Both 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 10) - Both 11 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) - Both 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node <2, 11, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) - Both 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node <3, 5, 15>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) - Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node <4, 8, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than each respective node to form triangles.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) - Both 16 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node <11, 16, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than each respective node to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 11) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
