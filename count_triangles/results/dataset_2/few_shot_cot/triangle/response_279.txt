Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Triangle 1: <0, 9, 12> -> 0 is connected to 9 and 12, 9 is connected to 12. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Triangle 1: <1, 5, 13> -> 1 is connected to 5 and 13, 5 is connected to 13. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Triangle 1: <0, 2, 12> -> 0 is connected to 2 and 12, 2 is connected to 12. Triangle formed.
    * Triangle 2: <2, 11, 12> -> 2 is connected to 11 and 12, 11 is connected to 12. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Triangle 1: <4, 11, 18> -> 4 is connected to 11 and 18, 11 is connected to 18. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Triangle 1: <1, 5, 13> -> Already counted when processing Node 1.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there are less than 2 nodes with higher numbers for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
