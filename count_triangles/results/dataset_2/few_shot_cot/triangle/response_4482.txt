Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) 
Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph. 

[<0, 11, 16>, <0, 11, 19>, <1, 26, 27>, <4, 12, 16>, <4, 17, 26>, <4, 18, 8>, <5, 15, 16>, <6, 12, 16>, <7, 14, 16>, <8, 18, 4>, <9, 17, 19>, <13, 17, 29>, <14, 16, 25>, <16, 0, 27>]
