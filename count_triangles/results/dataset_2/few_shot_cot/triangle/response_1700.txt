Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) - 6 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) - 6 and 2 are connected, but 6 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other (missing edge to form a triangle).
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) - 7 and 1 are connected, but 7 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other (missing edge to form a triangle).
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) - 7 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 2) - 1 and 2 are connected, but 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other (missing edge to form a triangle).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Continue the process for Node 1 based on the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Continue the process for Node 2 based on the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Continue the process for Node 3 based on the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Continue the process for Node 4 based on the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Continue the process for Node 5 based on the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Continue the process for Node 6 based on the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Continue the process for Node 7 based on the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Continue the process for Node 8 based on the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Continue the process for Node 9 based on the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Continue the process for Node 10 based on the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Continue the process for Node 11 based on the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Continue the process for Node 12 based on the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Continue the process for Node 13 based on the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 14:
    * Continue the process for Node 14 based on the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 3 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is [9].
