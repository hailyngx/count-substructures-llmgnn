Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not connected.
    * No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not connected.
    * No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are connected via (4, 10).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 8, 10>

* Node 5:
    * No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are connected via (8, 6) but they are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> Already counted when considering Node 4, so we skip it as a pair for Node 6.
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not connected.
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No additional triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are not connected.
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No additional triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No additional triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are connected via (15, 14).
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: <14, 15, 17>

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> Already counted when considering Node 14, so we skip it as a pair for Node 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
