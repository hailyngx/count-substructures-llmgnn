Response:
Following the provided information and applying the method shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are directly connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because the edge (7, 9) is not in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because the edge (7, 8) is not in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because the edge (7, 8) is not in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 5), but since 1 and 5 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
