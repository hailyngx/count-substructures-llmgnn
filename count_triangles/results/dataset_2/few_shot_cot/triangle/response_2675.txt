Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    * Not enough unique nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    * Not enough unique nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    * Not enough unique nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    * Not enough unique nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> 1 and 17 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

12. Node 11:
    * Not enough unique nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

14. Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

15. Node 14:
    * Not enough unique nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

16. Node 15:
    * Not enough unique nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

17. Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

18. Node 17:
    * Not enough unique nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

19. Node 18:
    * Not enough unique nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

20. Node 19:
    * Not enough unique nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [7].
