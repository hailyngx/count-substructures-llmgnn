Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes. No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 11 are also connected. Potential triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue the same process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles: 0

...

Finally, sum up the total number of triangles found in each node:

* Total number of triangles in the graph: [(total number of triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node)] = [0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + ...] = [total number of triangles]

Therefore, to find the number of triangles in the given graph, continue the process as shown above for each node. Good luck!
