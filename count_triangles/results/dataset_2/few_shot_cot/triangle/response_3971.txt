Response:
Following the same process as described in the example above, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 25) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 16) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 22) -> Both 6 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 22) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pairs skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (28, 19) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (28, 27) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 29) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (19, 27) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (19, 29) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (27, 29) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pairs skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pairs skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pairs skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pairs skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pairs skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pairs skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pairs skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pairs skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19, Node 20, Node 21, Node 22, Node 23, Node 24, Node 25, Node 26, Node 27, Node 28, Node 29:
    * No pairs to consider for triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
