Response:
Following the same process outlined in the example provided earlier:
        
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 28) -> Triangle formed with Node 11.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 28) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (8, 22) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 1 triangle
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 0 triangles
* Node 22: 0 triangles
* Node 23: 0 triangles
* Node 24: 1 triangle
* Node 25: 0 triangles
* Node 26: 0 triangles
* Node 27: 0 triangles
* Node 28: 1 triangle
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 1 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 1 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 8, 28>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 25>, <0, 8, 22>, <0, 7, 11>, <1, 8, 28>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 25, 16>, <5, 9, 8>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
