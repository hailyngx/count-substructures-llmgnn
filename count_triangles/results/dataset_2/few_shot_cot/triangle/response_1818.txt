Response:
Following the same step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they do not share a common edge in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Already counted when considering Node 0, skipping.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Already counted when considering Node 1, skipping.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Already counted when considering Node 1, skipping.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Already counted when considering Node 1, skipping.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Already counted when considering Node 6, skipping.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Already counted when considering Node 6, skipping.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
