Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are directly connected as (7, 17) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are directly connected as (14, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are directly connected as (6, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are directly connected as (10, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are directly connected as (7, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are directly connected as (9, 15) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are directly connected as (8, 17) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9 and 10:
    * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes greater than 9 or 10 to form triangles.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 11.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are directly connected as (19, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
