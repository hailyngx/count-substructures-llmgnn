Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (22, 17) -> 22 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 25) -> 22 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (22, 26) -> 22 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 25) -> 17 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs left for Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs left for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping the pair with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 20) -> 4 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs left for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 27) -> 13 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 4) -> 13 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (27, 4) -> 27 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs left for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Let's continue this process for remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles in this graph.
