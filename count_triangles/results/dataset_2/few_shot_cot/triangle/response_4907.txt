Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed because 9 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed because 9 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed because 9 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed because 9 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no neighbors greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed because 9 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed because 9 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed because 9 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5.
    * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5.
    * Pair 5: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed because 9 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed because 9 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed because 9 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no neighbors greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 9.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 9.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 9.
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
