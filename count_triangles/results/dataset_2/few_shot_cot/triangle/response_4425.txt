Response:
Following the same approach as the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph based on each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 7) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 1) -> Connected in the edge list. Checking for the third connection.
        * (1, 8) -> Connected in the edge list. Triangle formed: <0, 11, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 0) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 11) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Connected in the edge list. Checking for the third connection.
        * (8, 2) -> Connected in the edge list. Triangle formed: <2, 8, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> Connected in the edge list. Checking for the third connection.
        * (2, 4) -> Connected in the edge list. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
