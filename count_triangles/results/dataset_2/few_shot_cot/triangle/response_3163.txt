Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are connected as (0, 9) is in the edge list, but 0 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
    - Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are directly connected as (5, 11) is in the edge list. However, they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
    - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    - Pair 1: (0, 15) -> 0 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are directly connected as (7, 15) is in the edge list. They are also 1-hop neighbors of each other. Triangle formed: <7, 14, 15>
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. **Node 8:**
    - Pair 1: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. **Node 10:**
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. **Node 11:**
    - Pair 1: (7, 15) -> Already counted when Node 7 was the smallest numbered. Skip.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. **Node 12:**
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. **Node 13:**
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. **Node 14:**
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

16. **Node 15:**
    - Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

17. **Node 16:**
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

18. **Node 17:**
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

19. **Node 18:**
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

20. **Node 19:**
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Adding up all the triangles found for each node:
\[1\]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
