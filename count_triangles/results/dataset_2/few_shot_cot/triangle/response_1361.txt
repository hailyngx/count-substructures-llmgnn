Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 14 are not connected.
    - Pair 2: (8, 18) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 18 are not connected.
    - Pair 3: (8, 1) -> Triangle formed <1, 8, 0>.
    - Pair 4: (1, 14) -> Triangle formed <0, 1, 14>.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (8, 15) -> Triangle formed <0, 1, 15>.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest.

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 15) -> Triangle formed <1, 3, 15>.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest.

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest.

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest.

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest.

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest.

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest.

* Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest.

* Node 11:
    - No other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 11 as the smallest.

* Node 12:
    - No other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 12 as the smallest.

* Node 13:
    - No other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 13 as the smallest.

* Node 14:
    - No other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 14 as the smallest.

* Node 15:
    - No other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 15 as the smallest.

* Node 16:
    - No other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 16 as the smallest.

* Node 17:
    - No other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 17 as the smallest.

* Node 18:
    - No other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 18 as the smallest.

* Node 19:
    - No other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 19 as the smallest.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: [3] <0, 1, 15> <0, 1, 8> <0, 1, 14>

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
