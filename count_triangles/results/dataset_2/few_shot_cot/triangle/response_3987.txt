Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (19, 9) -> No triangle formed as 19 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (19, 13) -> No triangle formed as 19 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> No triangle formed as 17 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (17, 9) -> No triangle formed as 17 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (17, 13) -> No triangle formed as 17 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (19, 9) -> No triangle formed as 19 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (19, 13) -> No triangle formed as 19 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

* Node 10:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
