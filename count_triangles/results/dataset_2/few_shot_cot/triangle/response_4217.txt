Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
