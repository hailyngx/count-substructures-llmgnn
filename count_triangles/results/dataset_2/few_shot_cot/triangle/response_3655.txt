Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
