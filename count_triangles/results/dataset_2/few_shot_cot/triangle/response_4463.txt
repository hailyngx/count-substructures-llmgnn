Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Not a valid pair as 5 and 1 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Not a valid pair as 5 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> (5, 9) is directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) -> Not a valid pair as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> (6, 7) is directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> (6, 2) is directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> (2, 7) is directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> (6, 7) is directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> (6, 7) is directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Not a valid pair as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> (5, 9) is directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not a valid pair as 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Not a valid pair as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> Not a valid pair as 8 and 0 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> (8, 9) is directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Not enough nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, and 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
