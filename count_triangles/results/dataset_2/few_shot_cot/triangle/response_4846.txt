Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 3: (13, 0) -> Triangle formed: <0, 13, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 1) -> Triangle formed: <1, 10, 9>
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> Triangle formed: <1, 13, 0>
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> Triangle formed: <1, 12, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 2>
    * Pair 2: (0, 12) -> Triangle formed: <0, 12, 2>
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 3) -> Triangle formed: <3, 12, 13>
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 0>
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 4>
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 6, 4>
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> Triangle formed: <5, 9, 4>
    * Pair 2: (11, 5) -> Triangle formed: <5, 11, 6>
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <4, 5, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 6, 7, and 8:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, or 8 to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed: <5, 9, 0>
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> Triangle formed: <9, 12, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Triangle formed: <10, 11, 5>
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> Triangle formed: <1, 10, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Triangle formed: <5, 11, 6>
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Triangle formed: <9, 12, 1>
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> Triangle formed: <12, 13, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Triangle formed: <1, 13, 0>
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> Triangle formed: <12, 13, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 14, 3>
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> Triangle formed: <6, 14, 4>
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 2 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) = 27

Therefore, there are 27 triangles in the given graph.
