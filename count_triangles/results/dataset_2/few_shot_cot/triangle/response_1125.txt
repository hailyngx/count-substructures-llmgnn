Response:
Following the example from before, let's count the triangles in this graph step by step starting from each node:

        * Node 0:  
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (15, 2) -> 15 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Nodes 7 to 19:
            * All nodes have at most one triangle each, and they are skipped due to the lack of two nodes with higher numbers to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Nodes 7 to 19) = 8.

        Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
        
        The unique triangles found are <4, 8, 10>, <4, 8, 13>, <5, 6, 18>, <5, 14, 9>, <5, 18, 12>, <6, 9, 16>, <7, 3, 19>, and <7, 13, 0>.
        
        Hence, the final answer is [8].
