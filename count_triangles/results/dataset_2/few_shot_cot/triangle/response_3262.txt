Response:
Let's compute the number of triangles in the given graph by following the process outlined in the example provided earlier. Given that there are 20 nodes in the graph, we will check each node for possible triangles. 

Starting with Node 0:
- Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
- Pair 2: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
- Pair 3: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
- Pair 4: (16, 11) -> 16 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
- Pair 5: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
- Pair 6: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (11, 18). Triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Moving on to Node 1:
- Pair 1: (19, 8) -> 19 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
- Pair 2: (19, 18) -> 19 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
- Pair 3: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (8, 1; 1, 18). Triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for all remaining nodes in ascending order to find and count the total number of triangles in the graph, we sum up the total triangles found for each node.

The final answer would be the total count of triangles in the graph indicated by brackets [].
