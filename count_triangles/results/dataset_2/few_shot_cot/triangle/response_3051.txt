Response:
Following the step-by-step process detailed in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 1) -> 14 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 1 are directly connected as (0, 1) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 13 are directly connected as (13, 14) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (12, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 1) - Both 12 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 12 and 1 are not directly connected as there is no edge (12, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (12, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (8, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, we find:
    * Node 3: 0 triangles
    * Node 4: 0 triangles
    * Node 5: 0 triangles
    * Node 6: 0 triangles
    * Node 7: 1 triangle
    * Node 8: 1 triangle
    * Node 9: 0 triangles
    * Node 10: 0 triangles
    * Node 11: 0 triangles
    * Node 12: 1 triangle
    * Node 13: 1 triangle
    * Node 14: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
