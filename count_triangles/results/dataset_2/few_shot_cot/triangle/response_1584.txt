Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the given graph, we can find the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 27) -> 6 and 27 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (27, 14) -> 27 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 20) -> 6 and 20 are connected, but 6 and 20 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 20) -> 1 and 20 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (24, 14) -> 24 and 14 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 25) -> 5 and 25 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 5. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 6 to 29, calculating the total number of triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 20) + 1 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 1 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
