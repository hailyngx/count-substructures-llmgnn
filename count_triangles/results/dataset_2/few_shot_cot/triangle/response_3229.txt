Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Already counted when evaluating Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Already evaluated when assessing Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6 to 15: All skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6 to 15) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
