Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (10, 16). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (12, 19). Triangle formed.

    * Pair 1: (17, 1) -> 17 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 10. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are directly connected as (8, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (17, 5) -> 17 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 12. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 14:
    * Since there is only one edge connected to Node 14, no triangles can be formed with it as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (19, 16) -> 19 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are directly connected as (19, 16). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 17, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 18 and Node 19:
    * Skipped as there are not enough 1-hop neighbor pairs to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [9].
