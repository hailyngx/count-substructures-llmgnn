Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Both 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 13>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Both 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 10) -> Both 13 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Both 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <9, 10, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> Both 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <13, 4, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
