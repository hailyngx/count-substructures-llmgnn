Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not a triangle as there is no edge between 5 and 9.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> Not a triangle as there is no edge between 5 and 1.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> Not a triangle as there is no edge between 9 and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> Not a triangle as there is no edge between 9 and 0.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> Not a triangle as there is no edge between 6 and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 and Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not a triangle as there is no edge between 5 and 7.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Not a triangle as there is no edge between 7 and 9.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 and Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Not a triangle as there is no edge between 7 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Not a triangle as there is no edge between 9 and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Not a triangle as there is no edge between 8 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
