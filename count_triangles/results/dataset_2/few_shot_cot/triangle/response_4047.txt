Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pairs to consider: (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 7)
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs to consider: (5, 7) (5, 8) (4, 7)
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs to consider: (0, 5) (0, 8) (5, 8)
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs to consider: (2, 6) (2, 9) (6, 9)
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pairs to consider: (2, 7) (3, 7) (0, 7)
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pairs to consider: (4, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (4, 7)
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pairs to consider: (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 9)
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to smaller numbered nodes having been covered.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
