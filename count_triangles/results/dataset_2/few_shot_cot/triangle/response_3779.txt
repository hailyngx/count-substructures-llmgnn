Response:
Following the previous example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 20) -> Both 10 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 11) -> Both 20 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> Both 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> Both 3 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (1, 19). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (17, 25) -> Both 17 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 24) -> Both 17 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (25, 24) -> Both 25 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 19) -> Both 1 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (1, 19). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (21, 20) -> Both 21 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (20, 21). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 27) -> Both 21 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 27) -> Both 20 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (20, 27). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing in this manner, we calculate for nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... until the last node 29. Then sum up the total triangles found for each node to get the final answer.

[Final Answer: 7]
