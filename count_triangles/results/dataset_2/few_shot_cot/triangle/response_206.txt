Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 16 are also connected as (4, 16) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 13 are also connected as (4, 0) and (0, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (16, 13) -> 16 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 14 and 17 are also connected as (14, 17) shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipped because all other nodes are smaller than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 17 are also connected as (7, 17) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 10 are also connected as (6, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 10 and 15 are also connected as (10, 15) shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 17 are also connected as (8, 17) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

The process will be continued for Nodes 10 to 19. Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph once this is done.
