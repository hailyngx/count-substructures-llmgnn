Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Triangle formed: <1, 5, 3>

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 1>
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 7>

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed: <7, 5, 4>

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
