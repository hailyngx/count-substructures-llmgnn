Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node in the graph, here are the counts for the number of triangles involving each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (26, 7) -> Connected to 26 and 7, which are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (28, 7) -> Connected to 28 and 7, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 15) -> Connected to 6 and 15, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 28) -> Connected to 6 and 28, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 15) -> Connected to 4 and 15, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 19) -> Connected to 4 and 19, which are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (16, 6) -> Connected to 16 and 6, which are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 23) -> Connected to 9 and 23, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 25) -> Connected to 9 and 25, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (9, 26) -> Connected to 9 and 26, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Connected to 10 and 11, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (10, 28) -> Connected to 10 and 28, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Connected to 3 and 7, which are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (24, 6) -> Connected to 24 and 6, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Connected to 3 and 15, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 19) -> Connected to 3 and 19, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 19) -> Connected to 1 and 19, which are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Connected to 3 and 10, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 11) -> Connected to 5 and 11, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 6 to 29, and considering only cases where the node is the smallest numbered node, we find the following counts:

* Node 6: 1 triangle
* Node 7: 1 triangle
* Node 8: 1 triangle
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 1 triangle
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 0 triangles
* Node 22: 0 triangles
* Node 23: 0 triangles
* Node 24: 0 triangles
* Node 25: 0 triangles
* Node 26: 0 triangles
* Node 27: 0 triangles
* Node 28: 0 triangles
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Summing up all the counts, we get:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 9

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph.
