Response:
Following the provided instructions, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> Both 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
