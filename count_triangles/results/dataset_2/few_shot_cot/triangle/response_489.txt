Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 27) -> 5 and 27 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 27) -> 2 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 25) -> 3 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 25) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 27) -> 9 and 27 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 27) -> 5 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 27) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (6, 25) -> 6 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (6, 25) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (22, 24) -> 22 and 24 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
