Response:
Following the given graph and adjacency list, we will determine the number of triangles in the graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node and counting the triangles they form. We will then sum up the total triangles from all nodes.

Calculating the triangles for each node:

1. Node 0:
   - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 12 are connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 4: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 5: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 6: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
   - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 13 are connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 13 are connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
   - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
   - Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
   - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 13 are connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
   - No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

Continue the same process for Nodes 5 to 14:

6. Node 5: Total triangles = 0
7. Node 6: Total triangles = 1
8. Node 7: Total triangles = 0
9. Node 8: Total triangles = 0
10. Node 9: Total triangles = 1
11. Node 10: Total triangles = 0
12. Node 11: Total triangles = 0
13. Node 12: Total triangles = 1
14. Node 13: Total triangles = 1
15. Node 14: Total triangles = 1

Adding all the triangles from each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 10

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
