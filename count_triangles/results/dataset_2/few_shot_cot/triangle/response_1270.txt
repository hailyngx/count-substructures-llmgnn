Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * All pairs contain nodes smaller than 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * All pairs contain nodes smaller than 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Directly connected as (8, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * All pairs contain nodes smaller than 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
