Response:
Following the step-by-step approach to count triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are greater than 0.
    * No triangles possible with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are greater than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are greater than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are greater than 3.
    * No triangles possible with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are greater than 4.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected. But, 1 and 7 are connected in only one direction. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are greater than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are connected. But, 9 and 2 are connected in only one direction. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are greater than 6.
    * No triangles possible with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are greater than 7.
    * No triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are greater than 8.
    * No triangles possible with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are greater than 9.
    * Pair 1: (11, 5) -> 11, 5, and 9 form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are greater than 10.
    * No triangles possible with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 12, 13, and 14 as they are greater than 11.
    * No triangles possible with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 13 and 14 as they are greater than 12.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8, 6, and 12 form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 14 as it is greater than 13.
    * No triangles possible with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles possible with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the output is [2].
