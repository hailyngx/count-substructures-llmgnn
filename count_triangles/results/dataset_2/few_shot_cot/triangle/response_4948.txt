Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
   - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
   - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
   - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
   - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
   - The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 8 and 9 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
   - Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
   - The only pair we could consider is (5, 9), but since 5 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
   - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
