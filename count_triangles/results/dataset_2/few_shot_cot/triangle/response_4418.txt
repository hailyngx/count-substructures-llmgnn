Response:
Following the step-by-step method described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 12 are also connected. 
        * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are not connected because there is no edge (12, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (16, 10) -> 16 and 10 are not connected because there is no edge (16, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 13 are also connected. 
        * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 8 are also connected. 
        * Pair 5: (13, 8) -> 13 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 13 and 8 are also connected. 
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summing up the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are listed as follows:
[<7, 12, 17>, <2, 8, 17>, <2, 3, 8>, <10, 3, 4>, <9, 13, 8>, <9, 13, 1>, <0, 7, 12>, <11, 15, 18>].
