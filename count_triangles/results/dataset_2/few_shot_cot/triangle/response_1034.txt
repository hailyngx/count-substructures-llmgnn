Response:
Following the procedure outlined, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 11) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 14) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (9, 11) - Connected directly. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (9, 14) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (11, 14) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (9, 12) - Connected directly. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 13) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 11) - Connected directly. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (12, 13) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (10, 14) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (6, 11) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 1) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (11, 12) - Connected directly. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:

Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
