Following the same process as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 26) -> Nodes 15 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 21) -> Nodes 15 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 21) -> Nodes 26 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
