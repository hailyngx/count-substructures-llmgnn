Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 11) -> Node 11 is larger than 0. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 11) -> Node 11 is larger than 1. Skip.
    * Pair 2: (13, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 4) -> Node 11 and Node 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected (11, 4). 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes are larger.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 11) -> Node 11 is larger than 3. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 11) -> Node 11 is larger than 4. Skip.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> Both 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected (4, 11).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected (5, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes are larger.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> Both 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes are larger.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes are larger.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes are larger.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes are larger.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes are larger.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes are larger.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Nodes 2 to 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
