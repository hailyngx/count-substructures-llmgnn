Response:
Following the detailed step-by-step approach mentioned before, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * (Skipped pairs containing smaller numbered nodes)
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles with higher numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * (Skipped pairs containing smaller numbered nodes)
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles with higher numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with higher numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with higher numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
