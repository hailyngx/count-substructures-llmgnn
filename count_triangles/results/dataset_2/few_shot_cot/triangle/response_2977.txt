Response:
Following the provided example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> <6, 14, 0>
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> <6, 3, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> <4, 11, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> <6, 8, 2>
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> <2, 3, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> <6, 7, 3>
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> <3, 13, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> <4, 13, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> <6, 9, 4>
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> <6, 13, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> <7, 9, 10>
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> <7, 8, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> <9, 14, 0>
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> <9, 10, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 13.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> <13, 14, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 13

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
