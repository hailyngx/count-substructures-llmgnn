Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) - 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 3 are also connected as (4, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 4) - 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 4 are also connected as (0, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (0, 7) - 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 7 are also connected as (0, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (0, 6) - 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 6 are also connected as (0, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) - Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected as (4, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 6) - 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 7 and 6 are not directly connected as (7, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

Continuing this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
