Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 (Node 10-29) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: <2, 18, 23>, <3, 9, 18>, <4, 16, 28>, <6, 8, 13>, <7, 19, 21>, <20, 17, 26>.

Therefore, the answer is [6].
