Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no edge between 0 and 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 1>.
    * Pair 4: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 12 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 12, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it has already been considered.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 0>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 14 are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 10 are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 13 are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs smaller than 10.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs smaller than 11.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs smaller than 12.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs smaller than 13.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs smaller than 14.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.  
So, the answer is [4].
