Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 (7, 8, 1).
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 (7, 5, 5).
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 (7, 1, 1).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 (7, 9, 9).
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 (7, 8, 0).
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 (7, 0, 0).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 (4, 6, 3).
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 (4, 5, 5).
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 (4, 2, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 (6, 9, 9).
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 (6, 5, 5).
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (6, 2, 2).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 (7, 8, 0).
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 (7, 5, 5).
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 (7, 1, 1).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 (7, 6, 6).
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (7, 2, 2).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 (9, 8, 8).
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 (9, 1, 1).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 17.

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [17].
