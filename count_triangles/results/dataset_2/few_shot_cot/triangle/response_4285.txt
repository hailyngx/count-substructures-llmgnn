Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, we will now count the triangles in the given graph using the adjacency list:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 12) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 11) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 12) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 11) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (14, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (14, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
