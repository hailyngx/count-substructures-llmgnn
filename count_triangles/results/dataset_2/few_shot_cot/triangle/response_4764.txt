Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
[<1, 8, 0>, <1, 4, 0>, <3, 4, 0>]
