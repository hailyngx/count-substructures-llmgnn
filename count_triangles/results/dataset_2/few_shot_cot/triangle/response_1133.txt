Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 1 are also connected as (5, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it's smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> By looking at the adjacency list, nodes 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> By looking at the adjacency list, nodes 5 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> By looking at the adjacency list, nodes 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> By looking at the adjacency list, nodes 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> By looking at the adjacency list, nodes 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> By looking at the adjacency list, nodes 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> By looking at the adjacency list, nodes 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> By looking at the adjacency list, nodes 6 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> By looking at the adjacency list, nodes 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (6, 14) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> By looking at the adjacency list, nodes 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
