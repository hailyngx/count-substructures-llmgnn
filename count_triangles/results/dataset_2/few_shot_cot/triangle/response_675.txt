Response:
Following the step-by-step process as explained in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 9 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 8 are directly connected as (9, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 or 3 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6 and Node 7:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 6 or 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 or 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 2 and 7 are directly connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (2, 1) - Both 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 2 and 1 are directly connected as (2, 1) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
