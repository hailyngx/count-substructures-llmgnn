Response:
Following the method illustrated in the example provided, we will compute the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5. <0, 11, 13>
    * Pair 2: (11, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12. <0, 11, 5>
    * Pair 3: (13, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12. <0, 13, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2. <1, 11, 7>
    * Pair 2: (11, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14. <1, 11, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14. <2, 11, 13>
    * Pair 2: (11, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8. <3, 9, 7>

    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8. <7, 9, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Node 6 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4. <8, 9, 13>
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3. <8, 9, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes below 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8. <10, 11, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 17.

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph.
