Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0)

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 since 2 and 8 both are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and they are also directly connected as (2, 8).
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> Does not form a triangle as 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 since 2 and 1 both are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and they are also directly connected as (2, 1).
    * Pair 4: (8, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 since 8 and 1 both are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and they are also directly connected as (8, 1).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Does not form a triangle as 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 since 5 and 2 both are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and they are also directly connected as (5, 2).
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Does not form a triangle as 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 since 9 and 1 both are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and they are also directly connected as (9, 1).
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> Does not form a triangle as 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 since 1 and 3 both are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and they are also directly connected as (1, 3).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Isolated node, no triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
[<0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 1, 3>, <2, 9, 1>]
