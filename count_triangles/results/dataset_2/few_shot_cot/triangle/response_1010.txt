Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided adjacency list and edge list, here are the counts for triangles associated with each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (20, 21) -> 20 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (20, 26) -> 20 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (21, 26) -> 21 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 29) -> 15 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (29, 19) -> 29 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 28) -> 9 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 26) -> 9 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (28, 26) -> 28 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (24, 2) -> 24 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 6 to 29.
After counting the triangles for all nodes, sum up the total triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node. 

Finally, output the final answer inside brackets [] with unique triangles found inside <> each only once.
