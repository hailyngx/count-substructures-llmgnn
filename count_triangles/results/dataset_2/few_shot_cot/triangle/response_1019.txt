    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
