Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are directly connected. Triangle formed <0, 17, 18>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 3) -> 17 and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed <1, 17, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (17, 9) -> 17 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed <1, 17, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed <1, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed <1, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 17, 18>, <1, 17, 3>, <1, 17, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 9>]
