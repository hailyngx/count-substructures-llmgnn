Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 3) -> 13 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 3) -> 12 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> Both 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> Both 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 3) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [8].
