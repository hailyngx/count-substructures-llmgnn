Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) - Both 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 11 are connected as (3, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) - Both 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with a smaller numbered node.
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) - Both 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 14 are connected as (3, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 14) - Both 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) - Both 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 12 are connected as (1, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) - Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) - Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 13 are connected as (5, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) - Both 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (13, 4) - 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 4 and 13 are connected as (4, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) - Both 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) - Both 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 11 and 14 are connected as (11, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) - Both 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 4 and 13 are connected as (4, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
