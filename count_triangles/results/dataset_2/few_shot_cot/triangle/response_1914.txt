Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) - No edge between 10 and 17.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) - No edge between 10 and 14.
    * Pair 3: (10, 23) - There is an edge connecting 10 and 23.
    * Pair 4: (14, 17) - There is an edge connecting 14 and 17.
    * Pair 5: (14, 23) - No edge between 14 and 23.
    * Pair 6: (17, 23) - No edge between 17 and 23.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) - There is an edge connecting 3 and 11.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) - No edge between 3 and 19.
    * Pair 3: (11, 19) - No edge between 11 and 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs for Node 2 since all other nodes are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 21) - There is an edge connecting 12 and 21.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 24) - There is an edge connecting 9 and 24.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) - There is an edge connecting 9 and 7.
    * Pair 3: (7, 24) - No edge between 7 and 24.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) - There is an edge connecting 6 and 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 28) - There is an edge connecting 13 and 28.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 29) - There is an edge connecting 9 and 29.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24:
    * No triangles can be formed as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

* Node 25:
    * Pair 1: (19, 25) - There is an edge connecting 19 and 25.
    * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 26:
    * Pair 1: (18, 24) - There is an edge connecting 18 and 24.
    * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 27:
    * Skip all pairs for Node 27 since all other nodes are smaller than 27.
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 28:
    * Pair 1: (13, 29) - There is an edge connecting 13 and 29.
    * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 29:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8-24) + 1 (Node 25) + 1 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 1 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the answer is [10].
