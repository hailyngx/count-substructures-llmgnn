Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 7

Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the process outlined before, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4 as all possible triangles have smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles to form with Node 5 as there are no other nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles to form with Node 6 as there are no other nodes greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9 as there are no triangles to form with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
