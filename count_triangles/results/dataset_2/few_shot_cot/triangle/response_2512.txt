Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (8, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
