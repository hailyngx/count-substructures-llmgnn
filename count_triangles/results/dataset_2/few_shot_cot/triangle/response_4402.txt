Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles found involving Node 0 or its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    - No triangles found involving Node 1 or its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 2:
    - No triangles found involving Node 2 or its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 12 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - No additional triangles found involving Node 4 or its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 11 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    - Additional triangle from (7, 8, 11) as they are all connected.

* Node 6:
    - No additional triangles found involving Node 6 or its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 7:
    - No additional triangles found involving Node 7 or its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    - No additional triangles found involving Node 9 or its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 10:
    - No triangles found involving Node 10 or its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 11:
    - No additional triangles found involving Node 11 or its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 12:
    - No triangles found involving Node 12 or its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 13:
    - No additional triangles found involving Node 13 or its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 14:
    - No additional triangles found involving Node 14 or its 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
        
\[<3, 4, 12>, <5, 7, 11>, <7, 8, 11>\]
