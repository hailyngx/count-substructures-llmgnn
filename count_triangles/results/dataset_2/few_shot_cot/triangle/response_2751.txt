Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (16, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (18, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No valid triangles can be formed as all possible pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No valid triangles can be formed as all possible pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 13 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (13, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 5) -> No triangle formed.
