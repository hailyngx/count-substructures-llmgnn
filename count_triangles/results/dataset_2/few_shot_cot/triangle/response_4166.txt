Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 4.
    * We've already counted the triangles involving Node 4 while calculating for other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skip these nodes as they are greater than the previous nodes processed and do not have any triangles that have not already been counted.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
