    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3, 4, and 5:
    * These nodes each have fewer than two nodes greater than them to form triangles. No need to calculate triangles for these nodes.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs of nodes greater than 7 to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 1) -> No triangle formed.

    * Pair 6: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (14, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (14, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skipped as there is only one node greater than 10 to form a triangle.

* Node 11:
    * Skipped as there aren't any nodes greater than 11 to form triangles.

* Node 12, 13, and 14:
    * These nodes each have fewer than two nodes greater than them to form triangles. No need to calculate triangles for these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
