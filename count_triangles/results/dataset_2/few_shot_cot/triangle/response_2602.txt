Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 6, and node 2

Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
