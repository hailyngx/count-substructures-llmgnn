Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 11 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.

    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (4, 7) is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of Node 1. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 11.
