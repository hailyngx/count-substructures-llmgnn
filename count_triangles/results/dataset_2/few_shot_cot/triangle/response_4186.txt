Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example for counting triangles in a graph, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - <5, 9, 0>
    - No other triangles can be formed with this node.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
    - <1, 9, 0>
    - <1, 9, 4>
    - <1, 9, 2>
    - No other triangles can be formed with this node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

3. **Node 2:**
    - <2, 9, 1>
    - No other triangles can be formed with this node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3:**
    - No triangles can be formed with this node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
    - <4, 7, 9>
    - No other triangles can be formed with this node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5:**
    - No triangles can be formed with this node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
    - No triangles can be formed with this node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    - No triangles can be formed with this node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
    - No triangles can be formed with this node.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - <9, 0, 5>
    - <9, 1, 7>
    - <9, 8, 4>
    - No other triangles can be formed with this node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Now, calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 9

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
