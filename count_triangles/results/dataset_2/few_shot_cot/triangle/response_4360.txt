Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 24) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (14, 29) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (14, 12) -> Does not form a triangle, 12 is not connected to 29.
    * Pair 4: (24, 29) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 5: (24, 12) -> Does not form a triangle, 12 is not connected to 29.
    * Pair 6: (29, 12) -> Does not form a triangle, 12 is not connected to 29.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (21, 15) -> Does not form a triangle, 15 is not connected to 21.
    * Pair 2: (21, 4) -> Does not form a triangle, 4 is not connected to 21.
    * Pair 3: (15, 4) -> Does not form a triangle, 4 is not connected to 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as all connected nodes are smaller.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (21, 6) -> Does not form a triangle, 6 is not connected to 21.
    * Pair 2: (21, 11) -> Does not form a triangle, 11 is not connected to 21.
    * Pair 3: (21, 16) -> Does not form a triangle, 16 is not connected to 21.
    * Pair 4: (6, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 5: (6, 16) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 6: (11, 16) -> Does not form a triangle, 11 is not connected to 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as all connected nodes are smaller.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 29) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (6, 27) -> Does not form a triangle, 27 is not connected to 6.

    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 29) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (9, 20) -> Does not form a triangle, 20 is not connected to 9.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 4: (29, 20) -> Does not form a triangle, 20 is not connected to 29.
    * Pair 5: (29, 8) -> Does not form a triangle, 8 is not connected to 29.
    * Pair 6: (20, 8) -> Does not form a triangle, 8 is not connected to 20.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as all connected nodes are smaller.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (9, 26) -> Does not form a triangle, 26 is not connected to 9.
    * Pair 3: (9, 25) -> Does not form a triangle, 25 is not connected to 9.
    * Pair 4: (19, 26) -> Does not form a triangle, 26 is not connected to 19.
    * Pair 5: (19, 25) -> Does not form a triangle, 25 is not connected to 19.
    * Pair 6: (26, 25) -> Does not form a triangle, 25 is not connected to 26.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 29) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9.
    * Pair 2: (6, 20) -> Does not form a triangle, 20 is not connected to 6.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9.
    * Pair 4: (29, 20) -> Does not form a triangle, 20 is not connected to 29.
    * Pair 5: (29, 8) -> Does not form a triangle, 8 is not connected to 29.
    * Pair 6: (20, 8) -> Does not form a triangle, 8 is not connected to 20.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for all nodes in the graph will eventually lead to finding the total number of triangles present in the graph. Let's continue the process for Nodes 10 to 29.
