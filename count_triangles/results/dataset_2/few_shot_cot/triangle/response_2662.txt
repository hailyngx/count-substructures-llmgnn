Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 18) -> 0 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    * Since Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes, no triangles can be formed with it.

7. Nodes 6 to 19:
    * Following the same steps, we find that no additional triangles can be formed with nodes 6 to 19.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6-19) = 2
Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
