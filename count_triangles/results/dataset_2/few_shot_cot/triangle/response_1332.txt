Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, even though they are directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 12) -> 16 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 16 and 12 are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (2, 18) - 2 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 for all other nodes = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
