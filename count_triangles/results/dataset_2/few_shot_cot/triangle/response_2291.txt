Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 0.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 0.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are connected to Node 0 and connected to each other. Triangle formed <0, 5, 8>.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 0.
    * Pair 6: (9, 4) -> Nodes 9 and 4 are connected to Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 7) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 0.
    * Pair 8: (9, 1) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 0.
    * Pair 9: (9, 3) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 0.
    * Pair 10: (4, 7) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 0.
    * Pair 11: (4, 1) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 0.
    * Pair 12: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 and 6 are connected to Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (7, 1) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 0.
    * Pair 14: (1, 6) -> Nodes 1 and 6 are connected to Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * All pairs are greater than Node 1, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 2.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 2.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 2.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 2.
    * Pair 5: (9, 3) -> Nodes 9 and 3 are connected to Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 3.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 3.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Nodes 9 and 7 are connected to Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 4.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 4.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 4.
    * Pair 5: (7, 6) -> Nodes 7 and 6 are connected to Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 6) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * All pairs are greater than Node 5, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 6.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 6.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> Ignored as both nodes are greater than 6.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> Nodes 7 and 1 are connected to Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as they are the highest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
