Response:
Following the same approach as in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 2). Triangle formed <0, 1, 2>.
    - Pair 2: (12, 0) -> 12 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 12). Triangle formed <0, 2, 12>.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (0, 1). Triangle formed <0, 1, 4>.
    - Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (0, 2). Triangle formed <0, 1, 2>.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 8). Triangle formed <2, 4, 8>.
    - Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 2). Triangle formed <2, 7, 11>.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Similar to Node 2, skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 8). Triangle formed <3, 4, 8>.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (8, 2). Triangle formed <4, 8, 2>.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (7, 13). Triangle formed <6, 7, 13>.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (11, 2). Triangle formed <7, 11, 2>.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with them as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 10.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
