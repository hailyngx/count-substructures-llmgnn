Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as demonstrated before, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are connected, forming a triangle with node 1.
        * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are connected, forming a triangle with node 1.
        * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are not connected.
        * Pair 4: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are not connected.
        * Pair 5: (17, 14) -> 17 and 14 are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, as they are smaller than 6.
        * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (11, 11) -> Same node, not considered.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
        * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each to form triangles. 

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.
    
    Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
