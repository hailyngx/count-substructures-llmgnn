    * Node 4:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
        * There are no triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

    * Nodes 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    [Triangles: 2 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 0 (All other nodes) = 6]

    Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
