Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 18) in the edge list.
  - Pair 2: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (18, 15) -> 18 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (18, 0, 15) in the edge list.
  Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
Total triangles in the graph = 5

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
