Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as the nodes are lower than 0.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are directly connected.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are directly connected.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as all connected nodes are lower than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as all connected nodes are lower than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as all connected nodes are lower than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are directly connected.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skipped as all connected nodes are lower than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as all connected nodes are lower than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skipped as all connected nodes are lower than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are directly connected.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skipped as all connected nodes are lower than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skipped as all connected nodes are lower than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skipped as all connected nodes are lower than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 5 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 16.

Therefore, there are [16] triangles in the given graph.
