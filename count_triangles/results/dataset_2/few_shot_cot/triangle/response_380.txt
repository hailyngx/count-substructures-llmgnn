Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) - Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) - Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 13) - Both 14 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) - Both 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) - Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 3) - Both 12 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) - Both 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) - Both 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) - Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) - Both 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) - Both 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) - Both 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as the only other node is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) - Both 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) - Both 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 17, Node 18, and Node 19:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
