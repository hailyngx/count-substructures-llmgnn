Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (19, 0) -> Same as above.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (13, 1) -> Same as above.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 17) -> 0 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (17, 3) -> Same as above.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. Node 6:
    - No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
    - No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8:
    - No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
    - No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No possible triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. Node 11:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No possible triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. Node 12:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No possible triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

14. Node 13:
    - No possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. Node 14:
    - No possible triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

16. Node 15:
    - No possible triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

17. Node 16:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No possible triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

18. Node 17:
    - No possible triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

19. Node 18:
    - No possible triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

20. Node 19:
    - No possible triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
