Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example above:

* Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (4, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 10: (8, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (9, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (9, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (10, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (13, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
