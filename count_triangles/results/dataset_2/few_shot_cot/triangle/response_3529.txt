Response:
Following the approach mentioned in the example, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list. Forming a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 7, 9>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Forming a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 4, 12>

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> Both 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> Both 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 12 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Forming a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 4, 8>
    * Pair 4: (8, 12) -> Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 8 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> Both 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 2 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Forming a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 2, 12>

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0
  
* Node 11:

    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 8>, and <4, 2, 12>.
