Response:
Following the method described earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 29) -> 5 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 29 are also directly connected as (5, 29) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 26) -> 0 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 26 are also directly connected as (0, 26) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 17) -> 0 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 17 are also directly connected as (0, 17) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 26) -> 5 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 26 are also directly connected as (5, 26) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (17, 26) -> 17 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 1 are also directly connected as (5, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 11 are also directly connected as (1, 11) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 3 are also directly connected as (8, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 7 are also directly connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 23) -> 3 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 22) -> 3 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 22 are also directly connected as (3, 22) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    ...
Keep following this method for all the remaining nodes until you have counted all the triangles.
Finally, sum up the total number of triangles from each node to get the overall count of triangles in the graph.

Can you do that and provide the final answer inside brackets?
