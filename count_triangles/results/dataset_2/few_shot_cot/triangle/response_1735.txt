Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 12 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 12 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 14 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
