Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the graph:

*Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4, and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

*Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

*Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

*Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 8), but since 4 and 8 are smaller nodes, we skip this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

*Node 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
*Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
