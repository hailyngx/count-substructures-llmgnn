Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example provided with your graph data, we can go step by step to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 19: <0, 3, 19>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17: <1, 14, 17>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17: <4, 9, 17>
    * Pair 2: (4, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16: <4, 16, 18>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 19: <5, 6, 19>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip because smaller nodes form pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17: <9, 13, 17>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph are the sum of triangles counted for each node: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
