Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it only has one connection.

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 14) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 13.
    - Pair 2: (3, 13) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 14.
    - No more valid pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (7, 17) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 15.
    - No more valid pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 13.
    - Pair 2: (1, 13) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 14.
    - No more valid pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 9.
    - No more valid pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as it only has two connections.

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 16.
    - No more valid pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (5, 15) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 17.
    - No more valid pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it only has three connections.

10. Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 13.
    - No more valid pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (15, 17) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 7.
    - No more valid pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

12. Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as it only has one connection.

13. Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as it only has three connections.

14. Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Connected, forms a triangle with Node 1.
    - No more valid pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

15. Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as it only has four connections.

16. Node 15:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as it only has four connections.

17. Node 16:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as it only has three connections.

18. Node 17:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as it only has three connections.

19. Node 18:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as it only has one connection.

20. Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as it only has three connections.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
