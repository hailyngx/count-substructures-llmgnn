Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 13) -> 16 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 16 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (16, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 0 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (12, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (12, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (12, 15) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 7) -> 12 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 12 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (12, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 14 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (14, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (15, 7) -> 15 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (15, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (9, 15) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2


I'll continue this process for the remaining nodes and calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.

Continuing from Node 4 onwards.
