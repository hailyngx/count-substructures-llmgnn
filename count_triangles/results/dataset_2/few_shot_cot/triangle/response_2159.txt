Response:
Following the step-by-step approach shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (4, 0) and (0, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (2, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (2, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (3, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (0, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (6, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (6, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (6, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Already counted with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node. Avoid repetition.

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
