Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 13>
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> Both 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> Triangle formed: <0, 10, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 7, 9>
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> Triangle formed: <3, 10, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Triangle formed: <4, 13, 0>
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 14:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.
  
Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 13>, <0, 10, 12>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 10, 12>, <4, 13, 0>, <0, 7, 13>.
  
So, the final answer is [7].
