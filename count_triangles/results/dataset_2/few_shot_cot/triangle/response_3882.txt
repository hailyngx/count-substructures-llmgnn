Response:
Following the instructions in the provided example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 19) -> 0 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 19) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles involving Node 0: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 14, 19>

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than Node 1.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (0, 2) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (3, 19) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than Node 10.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than Node 11.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than Node 12.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than Node 16.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 17, and they are connected as (12, 16) in the edge list.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Nodes 1-19) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph, which are <0, 3, 8> and <0, 14, 19>. The final answer is [2].
