            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
            * No pairs found for Node 5 to form a triangle.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
            * No pairs found for Node 6 to form a triangle.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) = 20.

        Therefore, there are 20 triangles in the given graph. [20]
