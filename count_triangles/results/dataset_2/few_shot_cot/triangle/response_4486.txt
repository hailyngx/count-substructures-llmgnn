Response:
Following the previous example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Node 0 is connected to Node 8.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No other possible triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. **Node 2:**
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No other possible triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. **Node 3:**
    - Node 3 is connected to Node 17.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. **Node 4:**
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - No other possible triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. **Node 5:**
    - Pair 1: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No other possible triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6:**

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 12) = 2.

Therefore, there are **2 triangles** in the given graph.
