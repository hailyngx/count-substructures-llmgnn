* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected (6, 17).
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are connected (0, 6).

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
