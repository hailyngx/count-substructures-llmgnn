Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) - Triangle formed with nodes 0, 2, and 8.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) - Triangle formed with nodes 1, 4, and 2.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) - Triangle formed with nodes 1, 2, and 8.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) - Triangle formed with nodes 1, 2, and 5.
    * Pair 5: (8, 5) - Triangle formed with nodes 1, 8, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Triangle formed with nodes 2, 4, and 8.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) - Triangle formed with nodes 2, 8, and 5.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) - Triangle formed with nodes 4, 7, and 1.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
