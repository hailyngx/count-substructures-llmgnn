Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Pair 4: (5, 4) -> Connected, no other 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with, no triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Connected, no other 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with, no triangle.
    - Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Pair 2: (9, 6) -> Connected, but no other 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with, no triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Connected, potential triangle with Node 0 found, <0, 5, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip all pairs since all other nodes are smaller than Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Connected, no other 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with, no triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Potential triangle with Node 6 found, <6, 7, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 9> and <6, 7, 9>.
