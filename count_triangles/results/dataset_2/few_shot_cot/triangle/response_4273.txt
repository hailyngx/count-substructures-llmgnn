Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (0, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (10, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 16) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (0, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (10, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 16) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 16) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
