Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
  * Pair 5: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
  * Pair 7: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
  * Pair 8: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 9: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 10: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
  * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
  * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1. They are smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
  * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
  * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
  * Pair 5: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 3, 4, and 5 only have one or two neighbors each and cannot form triangles.

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
  * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2. They are smaller than 7.
  * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 7.
  * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
  * The node has only one neighbor.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 9.
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 15.

Therefore, there are [15] triangles in the given graph.

<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 9, 5>
