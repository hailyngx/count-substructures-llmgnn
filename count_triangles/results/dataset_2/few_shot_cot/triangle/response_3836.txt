Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, I will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 5, as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 6 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 10.

        Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
