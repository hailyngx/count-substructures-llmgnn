Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0:
    * (1, 3) -> Not connected directly.
    * (1, 6) -> Not connected directly.
    * (1, 9) -> Not connected directly.
    * (2, 6) -> Connected to both nodes 2 and 6 directly.
    * (2, 9) -> Not connected directly.
    * (3, 9) -> Connected to both nodes 3 and 9 directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest node: 2 (_triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 9>)

2. Node 1:
    * (4, 6) -> Connected to both nodes 4 and 6 directly.
    * (4, 9) -> Connected to both nodes 4 and 9 directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 1 (_triangle: <1, 4, 6>)

3. Node 2:
    * (5, 6) -> Not connected directly.
    * (5, 7) -> Not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * (8, 9) -> Connected to both nodes 8 and 9 directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 1 (_triangle: <3, 8, 9>)

5. Node 4:
    * (8, 9) -> Connected to both nodes 8 and 9 directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node: 1 (_triangle: <4, 8, 9>)

6. Node 5:
    No triangles possible with Node 5 as the smallest node.

7. Node 6:
    * (5, 7) -> Connected to both nodes 5 and 7 directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node: 1 (_triangle: <5, 6, 7>)

8. Node 7:
    * (9, 7) -> Connected to both nodes 9 and 7 directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node: 1 (_triangle: <7, 9, 5>)

9. Node 8:
    * No triangles possible with Node 8 as the smallest node.

10. Node 9:
    * No triangles possible with Node 9 as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
