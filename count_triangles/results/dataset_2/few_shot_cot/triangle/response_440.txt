Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Node 1 and Node 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 11) -> Node 1 and Node 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 15) -> Node 1 and Node 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 11) -> Node 5 and Node 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (5, 15) -> Node 5 and Node 15 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 19) -> Node 3 and Node 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - No pairs to consider as 2 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

4. Node 3:
    - No pairs to consider as 3 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

5. Node 4:
    - No pairs to consider as 4 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

6. Node 5:
    - No pairs to consider as 5 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

7. Node 6:
    - No pairs to consider as 6 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

8. Node 7:
    - No pairs to consider as 7 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

9. Node 8:
    - No pairs to consider as 8 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

10. Node 9:
    - No pairs to consider as 9 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

11. Node 10:
    - No pairs to consider as 10 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

12. Node 11:
    - No pairs to consider as 11 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

13. Node 12:
    - No pairs to consider as 12 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

14. Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (14, 16) -> Node 14 and Node 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 13, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (14, 15) -> Node 14 and Node 15 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 13. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (16, 15) -> Node 16 and Node 15 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 13. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

15. Node 14:
    - No pairs to consider as 14 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

16. Node 15:
    - No pairs to consider as 15 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

17. Node 16:
    - No pairs to consider as 16 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

18. Node 17:
    - No pairs to consider as 17 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

19. Node 18:
    - No pairs to consider as 18 doesn't have 2-hop neighbors.

20. Node 19:

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 13) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
