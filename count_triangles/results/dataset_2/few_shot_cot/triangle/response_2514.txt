Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
- Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Pair 2: (9, 18) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Pair 3: (10, 18) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
- Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
- Pair 1: (11, 19) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
- Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
- Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
- Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Both 6 and 10 are connected to Node 4, forming a triangle.
- Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
- Pair 1: (10, 16) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
- Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
- Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
- Pair 1: (9, 15) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
- Pair 1: (13, 16) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
- Pair 1: (12, 17) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
- Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 10.
- Pair 1: (19, 10) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
- Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 3 as they are smaller than 11.
- Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
- Pair 1: (19, 12) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
- Pair 1: (7, 16) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
- Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 and 16 as they are smaller than 14.
- Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
- Pair 1: (7, 18) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
- Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
- Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 and 13 as they are smaller than 16.
- Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
- No triangle can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
- No triangle can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
- No triangle can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.

Therefore, there is **1 triangle** in the given graph.
