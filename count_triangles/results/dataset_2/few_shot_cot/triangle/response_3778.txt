Response:
Following the method described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 13) and (0, 19). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (5, 10) and (5, 15). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10: Skipped due to no triangles able to be formed.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 2

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
