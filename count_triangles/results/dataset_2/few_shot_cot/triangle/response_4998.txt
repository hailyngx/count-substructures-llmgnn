Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No additional triangles formed with node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles formed with node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles formed with node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles formed with node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (2, 14), but since 2 and 14 are both smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles formed with node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles formed with node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles formed with node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles formed with node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles formed with node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 5), but since 1 and 5 are both smaller than 12, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles formed with node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles formed with node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.

Therefore, there are **2 triangles** in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer would be **[2]**.
