Response:
Following the step-by-step process illustrated in the example for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> Both 14 and 19 are directly connected to 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangle can be formed with only one node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 8: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 9: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangle can be formed with only one node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 7: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are directly connected as shown in the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 6 to 19:

* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 2 triangles
* Node 18: 1 triangle
* Node 19: 1 triangle

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 2 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = [15 triangles].

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
