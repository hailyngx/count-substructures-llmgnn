Response:
Following the step-by-step approach used in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 8, 9>
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> Triangle formed: <0, 9, 13>
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>
    * Pair 5: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 9, 14>
    * Pair 6: (8, 13) -> Triangle formed: <0, 8, 13>
    * Pair 7: (8, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 6, 8>
    * Pair 8: (8, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 8>
    * Pair 9: (8, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 8, 14>
    * Pair 10: (13, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 6, 13>
    * Pair 11: (13, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 13>
    * Pair 12: (13, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 13, 14>
    
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 12

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> Triangle formed: <1, 11, 14>
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> Triangle formed: <1, 12, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 13>
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 12>
    * Pair 4: (13, 12) -> Triangle formed: <2, 12, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipping each of these nodes as they are involved in triangles that are already counted when they were considered as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> Triangle formed: <6, 10, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed: <3, 11, 1>
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> Triangle formed: <11, 14, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Triangle formed: <1, 6, 12>
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Triangle formed: <1, 7, 12>
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 13>
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> Triangle formed: <10, 13, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> Triangle formed: <4, 11, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles = 12 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 3 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 28

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [28].
