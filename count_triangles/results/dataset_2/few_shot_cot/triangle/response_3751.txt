Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Connected to Node 3 and Node 6. Both neighbors are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Connected to Node 6 and Node 9. Both neighbors are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Connected to Node 3 and Node 6. Both neighbors are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Connected to Node 3 and Node 5. Both neighbors are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Connected to Node 3 and Node 9. Both neighbors are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Connected to Node 5 and Node 6. Both neighbors are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Connected to Node 6 and Node 9. Both neighbors are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Connected to Node 1 and Node 5. Both neighbors are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Connected to Node 4 and Node 5. Both neighbors are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs as there is no node greater than 7 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 and 9 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
