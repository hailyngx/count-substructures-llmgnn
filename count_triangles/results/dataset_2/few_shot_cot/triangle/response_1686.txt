Response:
Following the method described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph and list the unique triangles found:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 (9, 12, 4)
    - Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 (9, 8, 3)
    - Pair 3: (9, 11) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 4: (9, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 (9, 0, 4)
    - Pair 5: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 6: (12, 8) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 7: (12, 3) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 8: (12, 11) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 9: (12, 0) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 10: (12, 4) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 11: (8, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 (8, 3, 4)
    - Pair 12: (8, 11) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 13: (8, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 (8, 0, 4)
    - Pair 14: (8, 4) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 15: (3, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 (3, 0, 4)
    - Pair 16: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 17: (0, 4) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as it has fewer than 2 neighbors.

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 3: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 4: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 5: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 (7, 8, 3)
    - Pair 6: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 7: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 8: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 9: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 10: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (12, 8) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 2: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 3: (12, 4) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 4: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 5: (8, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12 (8, 4, 12)
    - Pair 6: (13, 4) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 2: (9, 10) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 3: (13, 10) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11:
    - No triangles can be formed as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 12:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 12. No other nodes left to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 as it is smaller than 13.
    - Pair 1: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 2: (3, 11) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 3: (10, 11) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 14.
    - No other nodes left to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are <9, 12, 4>, <9, 8, 3>, and <7, 8, 3>.

The answer is [6].
