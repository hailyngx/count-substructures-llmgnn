Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 and Node 9, as they are both connected to Node 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed as Node 2 is not directly connected to Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed as Node 9 is not directly connected to Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed as Node 9 is not directly connected to Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed as Node 7 is not directly connected to Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 9 and Node 12 as they are both connected to Node 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 15) -> No triangle formed as Node 4 is not directly connected to Node 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> No triangle formed as Node 6 is not directly connected to Node 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> No triangle formed as Node 4 is not directly connected to Node 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 2) -> No triangle formed as Node 11 is not directly connected to Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (11, 16) -> No triangle formed as Node 11 is not directly connected to Node 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> Form a triangle with Node 10 and Node 18 as they are both connected to Node 8, and they are also directly connected to each other.

    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> No triangle formed as Node 6 is not directly connected to Node 16.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as Node 6 is not directly connected to Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed as Node 7 is not directly connected to Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> Form a triangle with Node 0 and Node 15 as they are both connected to Node 14, and they are also directly connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as Node 4 is not directly connected to Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> No triangle formed as Node 6 is not directly connected to Node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than Node 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> Form a triangle with Node 17 and Node 19 as they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 18, but they are not directly connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
