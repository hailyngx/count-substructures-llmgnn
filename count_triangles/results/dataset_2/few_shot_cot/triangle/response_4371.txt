Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's compute the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs with nodes greater than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs with nodes greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs with nodes greater than 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 4) -> 13 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 8 to 29:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
