Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Nodes 0 and 1 are connected, Node 1 is also connected to Node 4, resulting in a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> Nodes 0 and 3 are connected, Node 3 is also connected to Node 5, resulting in a triangle <0, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) -> Nodes 0 and 4 are connected, Node 4 is also connected to Node 1, resulting in a triangle <0, 4, 1>.
    * Pair 4: (0, 5) -> Nodes 0 and 5 are connected, Node 5 is also connected to Node 3, resulting in a triangle <0, 5, 3>.
    * Pair 5: (0, 6) -> Nodes 0 and 6 are connected, Node 6 is also connected to Node 1, resulting in a triangle <0, 6, 1>.
    * Pair 6: (0, 9) -> Nodes 0 and 9 are connected, Node 9 is also connected to Node 3, resulting in a triangle <0, 9, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 1:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Nodes 1 and 4 are connected, Node 4 is also connected to Node 0, resulting in a triangle <1, 4, 0>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Nodes 1 and 6 are connected, Node 6 is also connected to Node 0, resulting in a triangle <1, 6, 0>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Nodes 1 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 0 and Node 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Nodes 2 and 3 are connected, Node 3 is also connected to Node 0, resulting in a triangle <2, 3, 0>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Nodes 2 and 6 are connected, Node 6 is also connected to Node 1, resulting in a triangle <2, 6, 1>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Nodes 2 and 7 are connected, Node 7 is also connected to Node 5, resulting in a triangle <2, 7, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip Node 0, Node 1, and Node 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Nodes 3 and 4 are connected, Node 4 is also connected to Node 1, resulting in a triangle <3, 4, 1>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are connected, Node 5 is also connected to Node 7, resulting in a triangle <3, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Nodes 3 and 9 are connected, Node 9 is also connected to Node 5, resulting in a triangle <3, 9, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> Nodes 4 and 0 are connected, Node 0 is also connected to Node 3, resulting in a triangle <4, 0, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Nodes 4 and 1 are connected, Node 1 is also connected to Node 6, resulting in a triangle <4, 1, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

There are no additional nodes to consider for forming triangles. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 16.

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.
