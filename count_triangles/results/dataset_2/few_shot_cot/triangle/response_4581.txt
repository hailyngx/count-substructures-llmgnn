        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.

            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * The only pair we could consider is (3, 8), but since 3 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

        Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
