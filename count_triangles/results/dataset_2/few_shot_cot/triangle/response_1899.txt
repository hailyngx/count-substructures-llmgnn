Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 11) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (14, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (11, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (11, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (13, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> There is no edge between 3 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (14, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
