Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (13, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (13, 10) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as other nodes are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as other nodes are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as other nodes are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as other nodes are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as other nodes are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as other nodes are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No pairs to consider as other nodes are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No pairs to consider as other nodes are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No pairs to consider as other nodes are smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to consider as other nodes are smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No pairs to consider as other nodes are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
