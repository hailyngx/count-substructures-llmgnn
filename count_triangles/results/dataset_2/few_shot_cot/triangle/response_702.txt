Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>.

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Not connected.
        * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 8>.

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>.
        * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Not connected.

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 6>.
        * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 8>.

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 9>.
        * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> Not connected.

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Not connected.

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <6, 7, 8>.
        * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>.

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 9>.

    * Node 8:
        * No possible triangles with larger numbered nodes.

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 9>.

    Summarizing:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 9.
    
    Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
