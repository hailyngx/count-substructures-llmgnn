Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    - Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    - Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    - Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. 
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. 
    - Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. 
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. 
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 6. No triangles formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. 
    - Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. 
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 5 as they are smaller than 8. No triangles formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. 
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
