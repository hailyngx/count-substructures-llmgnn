Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No more nodes left to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest, so total triangles = 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 12 are directly connected as (6, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Follow the same process to count triangles for each of these nodes.

After calculating for all nodes, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7] in the format shown above with unique triangles listed inside angular brackets.
