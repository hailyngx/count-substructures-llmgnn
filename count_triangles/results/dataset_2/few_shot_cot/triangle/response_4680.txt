Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> Both 15 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> Both 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * Skipped because they are smaller than the following nodes.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> Both 15 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 13, 14, and 15:
    * Skipped because they are smaller than the following nodes.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because they do not have other nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = [9].

Therefore, in the given graph, there are 9 triangles.
