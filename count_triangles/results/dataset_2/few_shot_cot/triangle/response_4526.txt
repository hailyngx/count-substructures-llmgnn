Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (8, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (10, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (13, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Similarly, you can find the number of triangles by analyzing the pairs involving Node 3.

Continue this process for the remaining nodes 4 to 14, check for all possible pairs within each node's 1-hop neighbor set, determine if the pairs are directly connected by an edge, and count the triangles where the current node is the smallest numbered node.

After completing the process for all nodes, calculate the total number of triangles in the graph and output the unique triangles found within brackets [] in the format <node1, node2, node3>.

Please provide the unique triangles found after calculating for all nodes.
