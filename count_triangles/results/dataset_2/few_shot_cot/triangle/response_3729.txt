Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 9) - Not in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 9) - Not in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (0, 9) - Node 0 and 9 are directly connected. Potential triangle with Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) - Node 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors. 
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) - Node 1 and 4 are directly connected. Potential triangle with Node 2.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) - Not in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) - Node 2 and 4 are directly connected. Potential triangle with Node 8.
    - Pair 2: (2, 5) - Node 2 and 5 are directly connected. Potential triangle with Node 1.
    - Pair 3: (2, 8) - Node 2 and 8 are directly connected. Potential triangle with Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) - Node 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) - Node 3 and 6 are directly connected. Potential triangle with Node 8.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) - Node 3 and 8 are directly connected. Potential triangle with Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. Node 4:
   - Pair 1: (4, 9) - Node 4 and 9 are directly connected. Potential triangle with Node 8.
   - Pair 2: (4, 1) - Node 4 and 1 are directly connected. Potential triangle with Node 2.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. Node 5:
   - Pair 1: (5, 6) - Node 5 and 6 are directly connected. Potential triangle with Node 8.
   - Pair 2: (5, 2) - Node 5 and 2 are directly connected. Potential triangle with Node 1.
   - Pair 3: (5, 9) - Node 5 and 9 are directly connected. Potential triangle with Node 4.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) - Node 6 and 8 are directly connected. Potential triangle with Node 3.
    - Pair 2: (6, 2) - Node 6 and 2 are directly connected. Potential triangle with Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

8. Nodes 7, 8, 9:
   - No potential triangles as they are directly connected to fewer than 2 other nodes.

Calculating the total triangles for all nodes:
Total triangles = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) = 13

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
