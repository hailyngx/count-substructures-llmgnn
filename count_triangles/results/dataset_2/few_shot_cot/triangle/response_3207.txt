Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (14, 16) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 2: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are connected as (11, 15) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for nodes 3 to 19:

* Node 3: 
  No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
  No triangle formed.

* Node 5: 
  No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
  No triangle formed.
  
* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (14, 17) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are connected as (14, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
  No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
  No triangle formed.

* Node 10: 
  No triangle formed.

* Node 11:
  No triangle formed.

* Node 12: 
  No triangle formed.

* Node 13: 
  No triangle formed.

* Node 14: 
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are connected as (17, 18) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15: 
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16: 
    * Pair 1: (15, 1) -> 15 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17: 
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
  No triangle formed.

* Node 19:
  No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
