Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are directly connected, but 0 and 11 have no common neighbor to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Both 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> Both 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> Both 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

This process will be continued for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to find all triangles they are involved in. Finally, the total number of triangles will be calculated and presented within square brackets at the end. Let's continue with the remaining steps.
