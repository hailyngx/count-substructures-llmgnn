Following the step-by-step process illustrated in the first example, let's compute the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Next smallest node connected to 0 or 1 is 3, continue to Node 3.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 (Node 9) + 0 + 1 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 0 + 1 (Node 15) + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 19) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
