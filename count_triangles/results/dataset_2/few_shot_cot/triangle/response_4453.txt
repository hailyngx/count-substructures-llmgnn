Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 12) (2 and 12 are connected) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 12 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 14) (2 and 14 are not directly connected) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (12, 14) (12 and 14 are connected) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 14 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (21, 20) (21 and 20 are connected) -> 21 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 21 and 20 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (21, 28) (21 and 28 are connected) -> 21 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 21 and 28 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (0, 29) (0 and 29 are connected) -> 0 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 29 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (12, 9) (12 and 9 are connected) -> 12 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 12 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 6) (9 and 6 are not directly connected) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (13, 21) (13 and 21 are connected) -> 13 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 13 and 21 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (17, 6) (17 and 6 are not directly connected) -> 17 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Proceed similarly for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 following the same process.

7. Summarizing the triangles found:
   * Total triangles in the graph = Sum of triangles starting from each node.
   * Total triangles in the graph = [Total triangles starting from Node 0 + Total triangles starting from Node 1 + ... + Total triangles starting from Node 29]
   * Calculate the triangles and sum them up to get the final answer.

Proceeding in this manner, calculate the number of triangles for Nodes 11 to 29, and add up all the triangles found from each node to determine the final number of triangles in the graph. Provide the final answer inside brackets [].
