Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (6, 17) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 13) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 17) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 10) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 8: (13, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 9: (13, 17) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 15) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 15) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 17) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 17) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 19) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles possible with Node 4 as there is only one connection.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.

    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles possible with Node 9 as there is only one connection.

* Nodes 10 and 11:
    * No triangles possible with Nodes 10 and 11 as there are fewer than two nodes greater than them.

* Node 12:
