Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example mentioned above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 23) -> 3 and 23 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 29) -> 3 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 23) -> 0 and 23 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 18) -> 0 and 18 are connected, and 18 is also connected to 1. Triangle formed: <0, 18, 1>.
    * Pair 5: (0, 29) -> 0 and 29 are connected, and 29 is also connected to 8. Triangle formed: <0, 29, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 23) -> Already counted when processing Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (0, 29) -> Already counted when processing Node 0.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16.

* Node 17:

* Node 18:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19.

* Node 20:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 20.

* Node 21:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 21.

* Node 22:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 22.

* Node 23:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 23.

* Node 24:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 24.

* Node 25:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 25.

* Node 26:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 26.

* Node 27:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 27.

* Node 28:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 28.

* Node 29:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 29.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) = 2

Therefore, there are a total of 2 triangles in the given graph, which are <0, 18, 1> and <0, 29, 8>.

The final answer is [2].
