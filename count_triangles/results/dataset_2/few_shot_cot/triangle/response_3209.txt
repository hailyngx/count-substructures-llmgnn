Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) - Both 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) - Both 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) - Both 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 14).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 27) - Both 7 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (7, 27).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 20:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 21:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 22:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 23:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 24:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 25:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (25, 13) - Both 25 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 25, and they are directly connected as (25, 13).
    * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 26:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 27:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 28:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 29:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 25) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
