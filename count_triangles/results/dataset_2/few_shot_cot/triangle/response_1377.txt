Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 28) -> 2 and 28 are connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected, but 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 28) -> 11 and 28 are connected, but 11 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 28) -> 16 and 28 are connected, but 16 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are connected, but 13 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 25) -> 13 and 25 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 28) -> 13 and 28 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (19, 25) -> 19 and 25 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 14) -> 14 and 14 are not considered. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are connected, but 6 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 21) -> 11 and 21 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 26) -> 4 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Already counted when Node 4 was the smallest numbered node. No new triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Proceed in the same manner for Nodes 6 to 29.

By following this process for all nodes in the graph, you can count the total number of triangles. Calculate the total triangles based on the individual counts for each node when it is the smallest numbered node and sum them up:

[Total number of triangles in the graph = Total triangles from Node 0 + Total triangles from Node 1 + ... + Total triangles from Node 29]

Feel free to follow the process for the remaining nodes to obtain the final count of triangles in this graph.
