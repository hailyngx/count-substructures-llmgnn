Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0

Response:
[6, 8, 0], [3, 7, 8], [7, 4, 5], [7, 8, 2], [2, 8, 1], [5, 3, 7], [5, 7, 4] 

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 
The answer should be [7].
