Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 12.
    * Pair 2: (10, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (11, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 0
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
