Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the graph given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are connected, but 5 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors and connected, but they don't form a triangle with Node 1 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors and connected, but they don't form a triangle with Node 1 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors and connected, but they don't form a triangle with Node 1 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors and connected, but they don't form a triangle with Node 2 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors and connected, but they don't form a triangle with Node 2 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors and connected, but they don't form a triangle with Node 2 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors and connected, but they don't form a triangle with Node 4 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors and connected, but they don't form a triangle with Node 5 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 12.
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors and connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

The final answer is [1].
