Response:
Following the step-by-step method as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 17) - 3 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (7, 17) - 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 17 are also connected. Let's check the third node:
    * 7: 1-hop neighbors are 3, 4, 0.
    * 17: 1-hop neighbors are 11, 16, 13, 0.
    * The triangle formed is <0, 7, 17>.

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
  * Pair 1: (12, 19) - 12 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (12, 18) - 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Let's check the third node:
    * 12: 1-hop neighbors are 5, 18, 1.
    * 18: 1-hop neighbors are 6, 12, 1.
    * The triangle formed is <1, 12, 18>.

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * Pair 1: (15, 9) - 15 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Let's check the third node:
    * 15: 1-hop neighbors are 3, 4, 2.
    * 9: 1-hop neighbors are 3, 2, 10.
    * The triangle formed is <2, 15, 9>.

Continue this process for Nodes 3 through 19.
