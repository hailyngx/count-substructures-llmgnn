Response:
Following the approach shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edges list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edges list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edges list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edges list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edges list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edges list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edges list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edges list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than any of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
