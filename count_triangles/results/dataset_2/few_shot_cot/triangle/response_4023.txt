Response:
Following the step-by-step approach, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Total triangles with Node 0: 0

* Node 1:
    * Total triangles with Node 1: 0

* Node 2:
    * Total triangles with Node 2: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <5, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6: 1

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 6) + 0 (all other nodes) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
