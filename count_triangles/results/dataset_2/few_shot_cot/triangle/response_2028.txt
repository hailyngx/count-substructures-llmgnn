Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Skipped because 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) - Skipped because 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) - Both 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 4) - Both 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) - Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (9, 7) - Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 1) - Skipped because 1 is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) - Skipped because 0 is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) - Skipped because 0 is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) - Skipped because 0 is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - Skipped because 6 is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) - Both 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) - Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) - Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 2 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) - Skipped because 1 is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [7].
