This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for counting triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs where the other nodes are smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest node.

Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs where the other nodes are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest node.

Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (0, 8), but since 0 and 8 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest node.

Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest node.

Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest node.

Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (1, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 2), but since 1 and 2 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest node.

Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest node.

Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.

Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
