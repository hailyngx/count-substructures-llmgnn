Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (0, 2, 9). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 12, 3). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (8, 5, 15). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (9, 7, 12). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (14, 8, 19). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    - Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
