Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's compute the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) - Nodes 10 and 16 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) - Nodes 8 and 11 are directly connected as (8, 11) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) - Nodes 11 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) - Nodes 6 and 10 are directly connected as (6, 10) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) - Nodes 7 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) - Nodes 9 and 17 are directly connected as (9, 17) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Nodes 6 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (11, 5) - Nodes 11 and 5 are directly connected as (11, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Nodes 2 and 7 are directly connected as (2, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) - Nodes 6 and 13 are directly connected as (6, 13) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (16, 7) - Nodes 16 and 7 are directly connected as (16, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) - Nodes 11 and 8 are directly connected as (11, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) - Nodes 4 and 17 are directly connected as (4, 17) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) - Nodes 2 and 12 are directly connected as (2, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) - Nodes 8 and 18 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 12: 0
* Node 13: 2
* Node 14: 0
* Node 15: 0
* Node 16: 1
* Node 17: 1
* Node 18: 0
* Node 19: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
