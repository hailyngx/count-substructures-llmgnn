Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Form a triangle with Node 7: <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 5: <0, 4, 7>
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Form a triangle with Node 4: <1, 3, 9>
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> Form a triangle with Node 7: <1, 6, 5>
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 9: <1, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Form a triangle with Node 4: <1, 3, 9>
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Form a triangle with Node 1: <3, 4, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Form a triangle with Node 1: <1, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Form a triangle with Node 1: <1, 5, 9>
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
