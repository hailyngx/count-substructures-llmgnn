Response:
Following the step-by-step process as described in the first example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 5: (6, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 6: (9, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as it has only one connection.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 4: (9, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 5: (6, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 7: (9, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 8: (9, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 as they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 as they are all connected in a cycle.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 as well since they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 as they are all connected in a cycle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 17.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
