Response:
Following the same process as described in the example above, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 19) -> Both 6 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 19 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> Both 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 12 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Both 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> Both 3 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 17 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 12 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are no other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 19) -> Both 0 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 0 and 19 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> Both 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 10 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Both 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 3 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> Both 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 7 and 15 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 7 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 11 to 19:
    * Skipped due to the lack of at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
