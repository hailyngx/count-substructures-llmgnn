Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (2, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs including nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (7, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
