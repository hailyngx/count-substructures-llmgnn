Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forming a triangle with Node 2
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Forming a triangle with Node 3
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Forming a triangle with Node 5
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> Forming a triangle with Node 7
    * Pair 5: (6, 1) -> Forming a triangle with Node 3
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 2) -> Forming a triangle with Node 7
    * Pair 8: (6, 5) -> Forming a triangle with Node 7
    * Pair 9: (1, 8) -> Forming a triangle with Node 5
    * Pair 10: (1, 2) -> Forming a triangle with Node 7
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 10

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs already considered with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> Forming a triangle with Node 7
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Forming a triangle with Node 7
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs already considered with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> Forming a triangle with Node 6
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs already considered with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> Forming a triangle with Node 5
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs already considered with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forming a triangle with Node 3
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs already considered with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 5.

* Node 6: 
    * Skip pairs already considered with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No new triangles can be formed starting with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9: 
    * Cannot form triangles as they don't have 2 nodes greater than them.

Total triangles in the graph: [15]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 8, 5>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 4, 2>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 7, 5>.
