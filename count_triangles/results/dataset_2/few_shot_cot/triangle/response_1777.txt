Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
[<1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 10>, <9, 13, 14>, <0, 11, 13>, <0, 11, 14>, <0, 13, 14>, <2, 9, 11>, <2, 9, 13>, <4, 6, 10>, <0, 13, 11>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 8, 5>]
