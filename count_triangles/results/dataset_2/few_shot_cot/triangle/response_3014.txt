Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 16.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> Triangle formed with Node 11.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 4: (2, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * Skipping these nodes as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
