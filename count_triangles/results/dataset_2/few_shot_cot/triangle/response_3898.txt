Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 13. <0, 4, 13>
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> Both 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 11, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 11. <0, 11, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Both 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 5. <2, 4, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's proceed with the remaining nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 and Node 12. <3, 6, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 and Node 14. <7, 9, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 14. <7, 9, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 and Node 1. <0, 11, 1>
    * Pair 2: (0, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 and Node 12. <0, 11, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 and Node 6. <3, 6, 12>
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 and Node 11. <0, 11, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 13. <0, 4, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 14. <7, 9, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 2 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
[<0, 4, 13>, <0, 11, 1>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 6, 12>, <7, 9, 14>, <0, 11, 12>]
