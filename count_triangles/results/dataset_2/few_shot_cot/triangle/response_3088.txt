Response:
Following the same approach as in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (0, 28) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 4: (28, 4) -> No triangle formed as 28 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed as 10 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (1, 16) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (18, 26) -> No triangle formed as 18 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (26, 18) -> No triangle formed as 26 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (26, 13) -> Triangle formed! <2, 26, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (3, 23) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 23 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (27, 24) -> No triangle formed as 27 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (4, 24) -> Triangle formed! <4, 27, 24>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    No triangles can be formed as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (10, 21) -> No triangle formed as 10 and 21 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11, 12, 13:
    No triangles can be formed as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 15 through 28:
    No triangles can be formed as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

* Node 29:
    * Pair 1: (13, 28) -> No triangle formed as 13 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) +
  0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [2].
