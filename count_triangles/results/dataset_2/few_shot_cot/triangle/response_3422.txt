Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - Not a triangle as they are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7)  + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
