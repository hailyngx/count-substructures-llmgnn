Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2)

Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
