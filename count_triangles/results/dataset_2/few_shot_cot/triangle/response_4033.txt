Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (19, 28) -> 19 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 27) -> 19 and 27 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (19, 1) -> 19 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (27, 1) -> 27 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (13, 29) -> 13 and 29 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (29, 17) -> 29 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (25, 4) -> 25 and 4 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (25, 11) -> 25 and 11 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (25, 26) -> 25 and 26 are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 26) -> 4 and 26 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 26) -> 11 and 26 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

This process will continue for nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

After calculating the triangles for all nodes, the total number of triangles in the graph is found by summing all the triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node.

Please proceed with the same process for the remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles in the graph. Once done, share the final answer inside brackets [].
