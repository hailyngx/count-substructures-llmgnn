Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 4 is connected to node 5, 10, 11, 12, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 11, 4, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 10, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 2, 12, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, 0, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, 8, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 3, and node 14

Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 3) -> 11 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Continue this process for Node 1 the same way as Node 0, and count the triangles.

You can follow this pattern for Nodes 2 to 14 as well. Once you have done this count for all nodes, sum up the total number of triangles from each node to get the final answer.

Let's calculate and find the total number of triangles in this graph together.
