Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (20, 22) -> 20 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 20 and 22 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (20, 8) -> 20 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (22, 8) -> 22 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (16, 14) -> 16 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (16, 14) -> 16 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (15, 25) -> 15 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 15 and 25 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (25, 18) -> 25 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, 6:
    - Skipping the analysis for nodes 4, 5, and 6, as they are smaller than 7 and have been analyzed in previous steps.

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (12, 28) -> 12 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (16, 10) -> 16 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (16, 28) -> 16 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 6: (10, 28) -> 10 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 8, 9, 10:
    - Skipping the analysis for nodes 8, 9, and 10, as they are smaller than 11 and have been analyzed in previous steps.

* Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (5, 21) -> 5 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
Continue this process for Nodes 12 to 29.

After calculating the triangles involving each node and summing them up, the final answer is: [31].
