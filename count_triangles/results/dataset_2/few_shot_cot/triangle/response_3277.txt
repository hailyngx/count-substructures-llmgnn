Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 24) -> 14 and 24 are not one-hop neighbors of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are one-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected as (0, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 28) -> 11 and 28 are not one-hop neighbors of node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are one-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not one-hop neighbors of node 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are one-hop neighbors of node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 has only one neighbor, so no triangle can be formed.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 23) -> 8 and 23 are one-hop neighbors of node 4, and they are connected as (8, 23) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 24) -> 4 and 24 are one-hop neighbors of node 4, and they are connected as (4, 24) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 only has one neighbor, so no triangle can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Node 6 only has two neighbors, and no triangle can be formed.

* Node 7:
    * Node 7 only has one neighbor, so no triangle can be formed.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (23, 28) -> 23 and 28 are one-hop neighbors of node 8, and they are connected as (23, 28) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with only two neighbors.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (24, 29) -> 24 and 29 are not one-hop neighbors of node 10. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (26, 1) -> 26 and 1 are not one-hop neighbors of node 11. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No triangle can be formed with only two neighbors.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (2, 27) -> 2 and 27 are one-hop neighbors of node 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No triangle can be formed with only two neighbors.

* Node 15:
    * No triangle can be formed with only two neighbors.

* Node 16:
    * No triangle can be formed with only two neighbors.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (19, 23) -> 19 and 23 are one-hop neighbors of node 17, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continuing this process for nodes 18 to 29:
    * Node 18: 0 triangles
    * Node 19: 0 triangles
    * Node 20: 0 triangles
    * Node 21: 0 triangles
    * Node 22: 1 triangle
    * Node 23: 1 triangle
    * Node 24: 0 triangles
    * Node 25: 0 triangles
    * Node 26: 0 triangles
    * Node 27: 0 triangles
    * Node 28: 0 triangles
    * Node 29: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Nodes 9-29) + 1 (Node 22) + 1 (Node 23) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
