Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip, as there are no two nodes greater than 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip, as there are no two nodes greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 10.

* Node 11:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 11.

* Node 12:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 12.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 14.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 16:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 16.

* Node 17:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 17.

* Node 18:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 18.

* Node 19:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 15) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
