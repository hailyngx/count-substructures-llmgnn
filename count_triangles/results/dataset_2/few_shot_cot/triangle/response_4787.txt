Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 14) - No triangle formed because there is no edge between 3 and 14.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 7) - No triangle formed because there is no edge between 2 and 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are connected as per the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (9, 14) - No triangle formed because there is no edge between 9 and 14.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) - 9 and 13 are connected as per the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) - 1 and 2 are connected as per the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (4, 13) - No triangle formed because there is no edge between 4 and 13.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 11:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 12:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (12, 14) - No triangle formed because there is no edge between 12 and 14.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 14:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's sum up the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
