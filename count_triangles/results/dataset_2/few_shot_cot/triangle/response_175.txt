Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 4, 5>.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 6, 8>.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 6, 7>.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 3, 5>.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 7, 9>.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <6, 7, 2>.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
