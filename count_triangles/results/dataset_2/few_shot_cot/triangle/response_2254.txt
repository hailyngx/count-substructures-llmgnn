Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we'll calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 3: (18, 4) -> 18 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Node 2 has only one connection, so no triangle can be formed with it as the smallest numbered node. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 4) -> 14 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 is a part of Node 0, so it has to calculate triangles with nodes greater than 4.
    * Pair 1: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Similar to Node 2, each only has one or two connections, so no triangles can be formed with them as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 12, 13, and 14:
    * Similar to Nodes 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, each only has two connections, so no triangles can be formed with them as the smallest numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Nodes 12, 13, and 14 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
