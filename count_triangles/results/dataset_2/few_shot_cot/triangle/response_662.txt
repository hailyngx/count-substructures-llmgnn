Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No further triangles can be formed as the remaining nodes are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) - 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No further triangles can be formed as the remaining nodes are smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No further triangles can be formed as the remaining nodes are smaller than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
