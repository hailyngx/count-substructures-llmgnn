Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example before, we will identify the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 15 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 15 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 18 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 10 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No new triangles can be formed.

* Node 8:
    * No triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15:
    * Skipped since there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, and 11 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * No triangle formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 6) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
