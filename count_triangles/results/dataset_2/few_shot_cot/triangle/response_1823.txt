Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Node 2 has fewer than 2 adjacent nodes greater than itself, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Node 5 has fewer than 2 adjacent nodes greater than itself, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * Node 8 has fewer than 2 adjacent nodes greater than itself, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing the same process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles

Total number of triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
