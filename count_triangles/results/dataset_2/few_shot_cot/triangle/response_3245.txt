Response:
Following the step-by-step triangle counting process for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (8, 24) -> 8 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.

        * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 22) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
