Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 1

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9: Skipped due to insufficient nodes for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
