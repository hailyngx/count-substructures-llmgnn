Response:
Following the same method as mentioned in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 7) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 16) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 15) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 16) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 8) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) - Connected. No other node to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 4) - Connected. No other node to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 9) - Connected. No other node to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 6) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) - Connected. No other node to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 16) - Connected. No other node to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) - Connected. No other node to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (16, 14) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Connected. No other node to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15:
    * Skipped because there isn't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (16, 7) - Connected. No other node to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) - Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) - Connected. No other node to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
