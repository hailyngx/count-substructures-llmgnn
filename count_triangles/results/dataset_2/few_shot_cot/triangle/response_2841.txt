Response:
Following the same process as provided in the example above, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph based on the given information. 

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (11, 0) -> 11 and 0 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No other nodes to form triangles with Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No other nodes to form triangles with Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - No other nodes to form triangles with Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes above 9:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph would be calculated based on the analysis provided for each node.
Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are <5, 0, 11> and <15, 3, 19>.
