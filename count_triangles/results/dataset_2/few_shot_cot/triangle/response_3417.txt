Response:
Following the same method as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected as there is no edge (7, 13) in the list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected as there is no edge (7, 13) in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
