Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are connected and form a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both connected to Node 0 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both connected to Node 0 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both connected to Node 0 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 3) -> 10 and 3 are connected and form a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 6: (12, 3) -> 12 and 3 are connected and form a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected and form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both connected to Node 1 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both connected to Node 1 but not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are connected and form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 5: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are connected and form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 6: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are connected and form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs including Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected as no (5, 8) edge in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not directly connected as no (5, 10) edge in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not directly connected as no (5, 1) edge in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not directly connected as no (8, 10) edge in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are not directly connected as no (8, 1) edge in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are not directly connected as no (10, 1) edge in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs including Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are connected and form a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected and form a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (10, 7) -> 10 and 7 are connected and form a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected and form a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing the same process for Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:

* Node 7: 1 triangle
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 1 triangle
* Node 10: 2 triangles
* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 2 triangles

Summing all the triangles up:
[<0, 2, 10>, <0, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 11, 14>, <3, 6, 10>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 10, 7>, <6, 9, 7>, <10, 6, 7>, <14, 11, 1>, <14, 11, 4>, <12, 0, 8>, <13, 5, 7>, <13, 5, 14>]
