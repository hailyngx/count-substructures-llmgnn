Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 26) -> 10 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (10, 26) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 28) -> 2 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 28 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Proceeding in the same fashion for the rest of the nodes will help in finding the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's continue this process for Nodes 3 to 29.
