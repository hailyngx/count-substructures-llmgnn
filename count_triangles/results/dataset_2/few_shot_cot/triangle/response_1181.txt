Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph given:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (19, 29) -> 19 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 23) -> 3 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Pairs including smaller nodes are skipped.
    - No pairs to form a triangle with Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 23) -> 1 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 25) -> 9 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (23, 25) -> 23 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Pairs including smaller nodes are skipped.
    - No pairs to form a triangle with Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (9, 24) -> 9 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 24) -> 8 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

... 

Please continue this process for Nodes 6 to 29, considering unique triples of nodes in each triangle. Sum up the total number of triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node. Finally, provide the total number of triangles in the graph within square brackets.
