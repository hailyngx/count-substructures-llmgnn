Response:
Following the step-by-step process illustrated in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or Node 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
