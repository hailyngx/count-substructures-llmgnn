Response:
Applying the same method as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (7, 0, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.

As for the unique triangles found, they are:
<3, 5, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
