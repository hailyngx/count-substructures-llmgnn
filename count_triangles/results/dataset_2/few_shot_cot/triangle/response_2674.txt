Response:
Thanks for providing the details. Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Nodes 1 and 2 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Nodes 1 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) - Nodes 2 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * The only pair we could consider is (2, 5), but since nodes 2 and 5 are not greater than 1, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Nodes 3 and 6 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) - Nodes 3 and 4 are connected directly as (3, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Nodes 4 and 6 are connected directly as (4, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) - Nodes 7 and 14 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) - Nodes 7 and 5 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
