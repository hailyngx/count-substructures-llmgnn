Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, here is the breakdown of the triangles formed for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (3, 11) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (10, 11) -> No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (3, 17) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (3, 11) -> Triangle formed: <1, 3, 11>.
  - Pair 3: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (17, 11) -> No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  - Pair 1: (11, 12) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (11, 17) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (11, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (12, 17) -> No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (4, 17) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 6>.
  - Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (3, 17) -> No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6: Skipped as they are connected to nodes for which triangles have already been counted.

* Node 7:
  - Pair 1: (13, 19) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (13, 2) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (2, 19) -> No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  - Pair 1: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (13, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15: Skipped as they are connected to nodes for which triangles have already been counted.

* Node 16:
  - Pair 1: (15, 16) -> No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
  - Pair 1: (2, 19) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (17, 19) -> No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18 and 19: Skipped as they are connected to nodes for which triangles have already been counted.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [2].
