Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

*Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (0, 12) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (0, 16) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Not a triangle.
