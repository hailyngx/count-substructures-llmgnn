Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Triangles involving Node 1: 
    * <1, 7, 13>
    * <1, 7, 11>
    * <1, 7, 10>
    * <1, 7, 14>
    * <1, 13, 10>
    * <1, 11, 10>
    * <1, 11, 14>
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 7

* Node 2:
  * Triangles involving Node 2:
    * <2, 12, 5>
    * <2, 12, 14>
    * <2, 5, 14>
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Triangles involving Node 4:
    * <4, 7, 12>
    * <4, 7, 11>
    * <4, 7, 10>
    * <4, 12, 11>
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Triangles involving Node 7:
    * <7, 13, 10>
    * <7, 11, 10>
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 8, 9, 10:
  * These nodes do not form triangles.

* Node 11:
  * Triangles involving Node 11:
    * <11, 9, 4>
  * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 13, 14:
  * These nodes do not form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 7 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 17

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph.
