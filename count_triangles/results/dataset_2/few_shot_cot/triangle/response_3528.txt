Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (5, 9) <5, 9, 0>
  - Pair 2: (0, 5) <0, 5, 9>
  - Pair 3: (0, 9) <0, 9, 5>
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (4, 2) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
  - Pair 1: (5, 1) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (9, 8) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
  - Pair 1: (1, 2) - Connected and both 1 and 2 are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 4>
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
  - Pair 1: (1, 6) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
  - Pair 1: (5, 8) <5, 8, 6>
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
  - Pair 1: (9, 3) <9, 3, 7>
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
  - Pair 1: (8, 6) <8, 6, 5>
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
  - Pair 1: (5, 0) <5, 0, 9>
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
