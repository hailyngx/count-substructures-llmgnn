Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 0) and (5, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. Thus, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 10) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 0) and (6, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. Thus, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 10) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. Thus, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (8, 3) and (9, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (10, 4) and (14, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (0, 5) and (7, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. Thus, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (9, 7) and (12, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. Thus, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. Thus, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs that involve Nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangle can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node. No other nodes left.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangle can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node. No other nodes left.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangle can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node. No other nodes left.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangle can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node. No other nodes left.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are: 
<[4, 0, 5]>, <[8, 3, 9]>, <[10, 2, 14]>, <[0, 5, 7]>, <[9, 7, 12]>, <[10, 4, 14]>, <[1, 2, 10]>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
