Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more triangles can be formed starting from Node 4.

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped due to lack of possible triangle formations with nodes greater than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
