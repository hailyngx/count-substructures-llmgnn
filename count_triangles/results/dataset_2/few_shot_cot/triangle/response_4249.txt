Response:
Following the method explained in the example, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) - 3 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) - 3 and 13 are not directly connected. 
    * Pair 4: (4, 10) - 4 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 13) - 4 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (10, 13) - 10 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes, therefore, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - 1 and 4 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) - 1 and 13 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) - 4 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) - 8 and 17 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) - 8 and 16 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (17, 16) - 17 and 16 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) - 17 and 18 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) - 7 and 10 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) - 6 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) - 11 and 18 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (11, 9) - 11 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) - 11 and 12 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
