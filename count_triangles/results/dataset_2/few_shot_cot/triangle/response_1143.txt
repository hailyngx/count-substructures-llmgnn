Response:
Following the method described earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle <0, 4, 5> formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Triangle <0, 4, 7> formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Triangle <0, 5, 7> formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Triangle <0, 2, 4> formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Triangle <0, 2, 7> formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle <3, 5, 7> formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9:
    * No pairs can be formed to create triangles as there aren't 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.
    
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
