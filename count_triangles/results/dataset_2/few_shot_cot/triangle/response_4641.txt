Response:
Following the steps outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 23) -> 17 and 23 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 8) -> 18 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (18, 23) -> 18 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 23) -> 8 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (21, 17) -> Forming a triangle with these edges would lead to a repeated triangle, so we skip this pair.
    * Pair 2: (21, 13) -> These nodes are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 7) -> These nodes are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Similar to Node 0 and Node 1, we remove or skip repeated triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Calculations similar to Node 0, Node 1, and Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping repeated triangles and applying the same logic as shown previously.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Continuing the process as above, considering unique pairs to count triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Let's continue the calculations for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 and then sum up the total triangles in the graph.
