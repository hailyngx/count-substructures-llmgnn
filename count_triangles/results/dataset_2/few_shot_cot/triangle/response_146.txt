Response:
Following the step-by-step process demonstrated in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (7, 0) and (12, 0) are in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (9, 29) -> 9 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (9, 2) and (29, 2) are in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (11, 4) and (14, 4) are in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles can be formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (14, 26) -> 14 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (14, 24) -> 14 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (14, 24) is in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (1, 23) -> 1 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (3, 8) and (16, 8) are in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected only to Node 2, and there are no triangles that can be formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Continue this process for nodes 11 to 29.

Applying the process to all nodes in the graph, we can then sum up the total number of triangles.

After counting triangles for all nodes, the final answer would be the total number of triangles found in the entire graph, encapsulated in brackets.
