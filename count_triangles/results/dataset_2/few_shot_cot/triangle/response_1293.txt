Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (Triangles: <1, 3, 14>, <1, 12, 14>)

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (25, 3) -> 25 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 22) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <5, 8, 17>)

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <6, 11, 19>)

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 24) -> 14 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <7, 14, 24>)

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> No direct connection between 17 and 19. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 4.
* Triangles: <1, 3, 14>, <1, 12, 14>, <5, 8, 17>, <6, 11, 19>.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [4].
