Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no edge (9, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but there is no edge (2, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but there is no edge (7, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9, 10, and 11:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 9, 10, or 11.

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and 12 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 13, 14, and 15:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 16:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13.
    * Pair 1: (16, 2) -> 16 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, and 16 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16.
    * Pair 1: (15, 8) -> 15 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 17, and 15 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 18 and 19:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
