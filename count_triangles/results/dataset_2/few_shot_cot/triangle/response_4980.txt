Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
