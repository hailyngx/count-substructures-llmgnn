* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.
