Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph and adjacency list, let's count the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3) 
There is only a single triangle found in this graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
