Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's 1-hop neighbors:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) - Both 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (1, 14) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) - Already counted when examining Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 14) -> Both 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 14) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) - Already counted when examining Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Already counted when examining Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Both 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (10, 14) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * These nodes have no triangles involving 2 other nodes with greater numbers than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
