Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 11 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 13 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (14, 9) -> No triangle formed as 14 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (11, 0) -> No triangle formed as 11 and 0 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 10 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed as 12 and 13 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (13, 10) -> No triangle formed as 13 and 10 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> No triangle formed as 13 and 10 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 5, Node 6, and Node 7: No triangles can be formed as there are no 2 distinct nodes greater than them for a pair.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> No triangle formed as 12 and 14 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 4 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 10 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed as 11 and 14 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed as 13 and 14 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (13, 4) -> No triangle formed as 13 and 4 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no 2 distinct nodes greater than 14 for a pair.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
