Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the initial example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No edge between 5 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 15) -> No edge between 6 and 15. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 18) -> Nodes 6 and 18 are connected. Now looking for a third node that is connected to both 6 and 18.
        * (18, 0) -> 18 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * (18, 7) -> 18 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed: <6, 7, 18>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> Nodes 4 and 19 are connected. Now looking for a third node that is connected to both 4 and 19.
        * (19, 12) -> Nodes 19 and 12 are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 12, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs with smaller numbered nodes to consider.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> No edge between 5 and 18. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (18, 6) -> Nodes 18 and 6 are connected. Now looking for a third node that is connected to both 18 and 6.
        * (6, 11) -> Nodes 6 and 11 are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 11>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> No edge between 0 and 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 15) -> Nodes 0 and 15 are connected. Now looking for a third node that is connected to both 0 and 15.
        * (15, 16) -> Nodes 15 and 16 are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 15, 16>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Nodes 11 and 17 are connected. Now looking for a third node that is connected to both 11 and 17.
        * (6, 18) -> Nodes 6 and 18 are connected. Triangle formed: <6, 11, 17>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 16) -> Nodes 2 and 16 are connected. Now looking for a third node that is connected to both 2 and 16.
        * (16, 18) -> Nodes 16 and 18 are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 16, 18>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> No edge between 0 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 15) -> Nodes 0 and 15 are connected. Now looking for a third node that is connected to both 0 and 15.
        * (15, 16) -> Nodes 15 and 16 are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 15, 16>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.

I'll continue analyzing the remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles.
