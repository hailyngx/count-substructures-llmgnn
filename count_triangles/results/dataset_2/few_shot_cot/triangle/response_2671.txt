Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 4) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (6, 2) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 4.
    - Pair 6: (6, 7) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 3.
    - Pair 7: (6, 4) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 3.
    - Pair 8: (6, 0) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.

    - Pair 4: (9, 2) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (9, 3) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (9, 4) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 0) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 1.
    - Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 4) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (0, 3) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 6.
    - Pair 5: (0, 7) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 5.
    - Pair 6: (0, 4) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 1.
    - Pair 3: (9, 2) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 4) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 0.
    - Pair 5: (6, 2) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 3.
    - Pair 2: (9, 2) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 0) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 1.
    - Pair 4: (6, 2) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (2, 0) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 1.
    - Pair 2: (2, 1) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 0.
    - Pair 3: (2, 3) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (0, 3) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 0) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 2.
    - Pair 2: (7, 3) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 0.
    - Pair 3: (7, 4) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (5, 0) -> Connected directly. Possible triangle with Node 2.
    - Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Since the remaining nodes (8 and 9) do not form triangles with at least two other nodes, we can conclude that the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
