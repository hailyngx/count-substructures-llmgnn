Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node and calculating the total number of triangles formed. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (15, 11) -> 15 and 11 are directly connected as (15, 11) in the list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) in the list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are directly connected as (4, 14) in the list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are directly connected as (6, 11) in the list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are directly connected as (11, 14) in the list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are directly connected as (3, 14) in the list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (11, 17), but since 11 and 17 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 11.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * No triangles can be formed as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

Output: [5]
