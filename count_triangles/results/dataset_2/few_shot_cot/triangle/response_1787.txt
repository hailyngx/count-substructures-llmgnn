Response:
Following the given instructions, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (0, 5) in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 13). Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
    * Node 8 and beyond:
        * No other nodes are greater than 7 to form triangles.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 7.

    Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
