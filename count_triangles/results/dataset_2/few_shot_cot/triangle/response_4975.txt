Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 12) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> Connected through node 8, triangle formed (7, 8, 0).
    * Pair 6: (12, 8) -> Connected through node 8, triangle formed (12, 8, 0).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 12>).

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Connected through node 5, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Connected through node 9, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> Connected through node 9, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 14) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 14) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Connected through node 2, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 19) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 19) -> Connected through node 19, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 5) -> Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 5) -> Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 17) -> Connected through node 5, triangle formed (5, 4, 17).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<4, 5, 17>).

The process will continue for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 12>, <4, 5, 17>, <5, 4, 17>, <7, 8, 0>.

Hence, the final answer is [5].
