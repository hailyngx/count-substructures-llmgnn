Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 and 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Finally,
