Response:
Let's go through each node to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * <5, 15, 17> - Node 5, 15, and 17 form a triangle.
    * <1, 4, 8> - Node 1, 4, and 8 form a triangle.
    * No more triangles with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * <4, 8, 10> - Node 4, 8, and 10 form a triangle.
    * No more triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * <9, 13, 16> - Node 9, 13, and 16 form a triangle.
    * No more triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * <4, 10, 19> - Node 4, 10, and 19 form a triangle.
    * No more triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * <6, 17, 18> - Node 6, 17, and 18 form a triangle.
    * No more triangles with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * No triangles with Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * <7, 13, 15> - Node 7, 13, and 15 form a triangle.
    * No more triangles with Node 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * No triangles with Node 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No triangles with Node 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No triangles with Node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No triangles with Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <5, 15, 17>, <1, 4, 8>, <9, 13, 16>, <4, 10, 19>, <6, 17, 18>, and <7, 13, 15>. Hence, the final answer is [6].
