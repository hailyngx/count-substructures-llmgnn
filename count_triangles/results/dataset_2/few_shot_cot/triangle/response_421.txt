Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 27) -> 9 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 29) -> 9 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (27, 10) -> 27 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (27, 29) -> 27 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 10) -> 17 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 24) -> 17 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 25) -> 5 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 25) -> 7 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 25) -> 12 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 3) -> 12 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as there is no other node greater than 8 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, we find the total number of triangles in the given graph to be [2]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 5, 25>
<3, 7, 25>
