Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's identify and count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Node 1 and Node 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Node 3 and Node 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Node 4 and Node 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles possible with Node 5 due to lack of additional 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Node 7 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles possible with Node 7 due to lack of additional 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
