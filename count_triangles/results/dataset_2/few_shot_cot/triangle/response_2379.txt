Response:
Let's begin by calculating the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - not connected directly
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - not connected directly
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) - connected directly as (3, 4)
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - not connected directly
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) - not connected directly
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) - not connected directly
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - connected directly as (4, 7)
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) - connected directly as (10, 11)
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) - not connected directly
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) - not connected directly
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - not connected directly
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller
    * No possible triangle with other nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) - connected directly as (9, 12)
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) - not connected directly
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) - connected directly as (9, 12)
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) - not connected directly
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) - not connected directly
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) - not connected directly
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as they are smaller
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) - not connected directly
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 as they are smaller
    * No possible triangle with other nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 as they are smaller
    * No possible triangle with other nodes
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<3, 10, 11>, <4, 7, 13>, <6, 9, 12>, <8, 9, 12>, <0, 3, 4>.

So, the final answer is [5].
