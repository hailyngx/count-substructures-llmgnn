Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 6: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 7: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 8: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 1) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 9: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 10: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 11: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 5: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles formed with Node 4.

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * All skipped as there are no nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 6 (Node 3) = 15

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
