Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

Here is the step-by-step process for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip since there are no 2 nodes greater than 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 2 are directly connected as (9, 1) and (1, 2) are present in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 8 are directly connected as (9, 1) and (1, 8) are present in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (15, 2) -> 15 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 10.

* Node 11:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 11.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (17, 14) -> 17 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are directly connected as seen in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 14.

* Node 15:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 15.

* Node 16:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 16.

* Node 17:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 17.

* Node 18:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 18.

* Node 19:
    * Skipping all pairs involving nodes smaller than 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 13) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
