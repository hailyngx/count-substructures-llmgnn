Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:  
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4 - Node 19:
    * Continue finding triangles for Nodes 4 - 19 using a similar process.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 - Node 17:
    * Continue this process for the remaining nodes.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10 - Node 17:
    * Continue this process for the remaining nodes.

Now, sum up all the triangles found for each node:
* Total triangles in the graph = Sum of triangles for all nodes

    [Total number of triangles in the given graph: []]
