Response:
Following the method described in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 17>
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>
    * Pair 4: (8, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 8, 4>
    * Pair 5: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 17) -> Triangle formed: <0, 8, 17>
    * Pair 7: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (16, 11) -> Triangle formed: <2, 16, 11>
    * Pair 2: (16, 0) -> Triangle formed: <2, 16, 0>
    * Pair 3: (11, 0) -> Triangle formed: <2, 11, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 10>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> Triangle formed: <4, 8, 11>
    * Pair 2: (8, 17) -> Triangle formed: <4, 8, 17>
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 17) -> Triangle formed: <4, 11, 17>
    * Pair 5: (11, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 6) -> Triangle formed: <4, 17, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

Continuing this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18 using the provided adjacency list would give us the total number of triangles.

Calculating the total number of triangles for all nodes would require going through this process systematically. Let's do that now.
