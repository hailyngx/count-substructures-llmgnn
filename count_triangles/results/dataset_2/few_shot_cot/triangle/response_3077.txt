Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph by following the same approach as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs of nodes with indices greater than 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
