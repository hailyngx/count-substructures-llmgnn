Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 9) -> 13 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].
