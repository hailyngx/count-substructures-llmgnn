Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, we will determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1**:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (0, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2**:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3**:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4**:
    * No triangles can be formed with just Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. **Node 5**:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6**:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7**:
    * No triangles can be formed with just Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. **Node 8**:
    * No triangles can be formed with just Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. **Node 9**:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  
Summarizing the triangles:  
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
