Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    - Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 2) -> Both 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
