Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example:
* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0 (Node 7 is smaller).
    * Triangle: <0, 4, 9>

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1 (Node 2 is smaller).
    * Triangle: <1, 5, 6>

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2 (Node 5 is smaller).
    * Triangle: <1, 2, 6>

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3 (Node 4 is smaller).
    * No triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (Node 5 is smaller).
    * Triangle: <4, 5, 8>

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Node 8 is smaller).
    * No triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (Node 7 is smaller).
    * Triangle: <6, 8, 9>

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (No nodes left).
    * No triangles.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Therefore, the triangles found are: 
[<0, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <4, 5, 8>, <6, 8, 9>]

The number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
