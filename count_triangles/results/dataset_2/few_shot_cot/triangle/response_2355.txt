Response:
Following the same methodology as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 18 are also connected as (2, 18) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (13, 15) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (13, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (13, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (14, 15) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected as there is no edge (8, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 3 to form a triangle with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 18) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 11) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (4, 18) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 6 to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (3, 18) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (9, 16) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 9 to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
