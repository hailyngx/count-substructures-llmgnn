Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 9 are connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 1 and 7 are connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

        Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
