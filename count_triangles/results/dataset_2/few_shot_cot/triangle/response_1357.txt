Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with node 8 as there aren't sufficient nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangle can be formed with node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
