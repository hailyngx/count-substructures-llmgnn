Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (8, 25) -> 8 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 29) -> 8 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (25, 29) -> 25 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (17, 23) -> 17 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (17, 29) -> 17 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (10, 26) -> 10 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Proceed with the same process for the remaining nodes, counting the triangles for each:
    * Node 4: 2 triangles
    * Node 5: 0 triangles
    * Node 6: 0 triangles
    * Node 7: 0 triangles
    * Node 8: 2 triangles
    * Node 9: 0 triangles
    * Node 10: 0 triangles
    * Node 11: 0 triangles
    * Node 12: 0 triangles
    * Node 13: 0 triangles
    * Node 14: 0 triangles
    * Node 15: 0 triangles
    * Node 16: 0 triangles
    * Node 17: 2 triangles
    * Node 18: 0 triangles
    * Node 19: 0 triangles
    * Node 20: 0 triangles
    * Node 21: 0 triangles
    * Node 22: 0 triangles
    * Node 23: 4 triangles
    * Node 24: 2 triangles
    * Node 25: 4 triangles
    * Node 26: 0 triangles
    * Node 27: 0 triangles
    * Node 28: 2 triangles
    * Node 29: 1 triangle

After counting the triangles for each node, we add up the total number of triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3-29) = 2

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
