Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph: 

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Skipping the pairs with higher indexed nodes.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Skipping the pairs with higher indexed nodes.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
  - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1.
  - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Skipping the pairs with higher indexed nodes.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  - Skip any pairs that include Nodes with smaller indices.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  - Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Skipping the pairs with higher indexed nodes.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
  Due to their respective positions in the adjacency list, there are no triangles that can be formed involving them as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
