Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - (9, 12): Form a triangle with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - (2, 6): Form a triangle with Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - (1, 19): Form a triangle with Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - None Identified

5. Node 4:
    - None Identified

6. Node 5:
    - (9, 18): Form a triangle with Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Node 6:
    - None Identified

8. Node 7:
    - (1, 19): Form a triangle with Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - None Identified

10. Node 9:
    - (5, 19): Form a triangle with Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. Node 10:
    - None Identified

12. Node 11:
    - (3, 12): Form a triangle with Node 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

13. Node 12:
    - (0, 17): Form a triangle with Node 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

14. Node 13:
    - None Identified

15. Node 14:
    - None Identified

16. Node 15:
    - None Identified

17. Node 16:
    - None Identified

18. Node 17:
    - None Identified

19. Node 18:
    - (7, 13): Form a triangle with Node 18.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

20. Node 19:
    - (7, 17): Form a triangle with Node 19.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles found for each node:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7
- The unique triangles found are: <0, 9, 12>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 7, 19>, <5, 9, 18>, <7, 17, 19>, <11, 12, 3>, <13, 18, 7>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
