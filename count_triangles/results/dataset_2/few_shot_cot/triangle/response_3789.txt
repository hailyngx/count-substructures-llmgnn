    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected because (6, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 1 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 1 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 9 and 0 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
