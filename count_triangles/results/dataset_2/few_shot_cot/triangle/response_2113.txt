Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 5).
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (8, 14).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
