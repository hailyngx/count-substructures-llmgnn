Response:
Following the provided example, we will go through each node in the graph to count the number of triangles. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected. Checking the 1-hop neighbors shows that 4, 7, and 6 form a triangle. <4, 6, 7>
    * Pair 4: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are connected. Checking the 1-hop neighbors shows that 4, 3, and 5 form a triangle. <3, 4, 5>
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected. Checking the 1-hop neighbors shows that 6, 7, and 0 form a triangle. <0, 6, 7>
    * Pair 6: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are connected. Checking the 1-hop neighbors shows that 7, 3, and 4 form a triangle. <3, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected. Checking the 1-hop neighbors shows that 9, 7, and 1 form a triangle. <1, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected. Checking the 1-hop neighbors shows that 3, 9, and 2 form a triangle. <2, 3, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected. Checking the 1-hop neighbors shows that 4, 8, and 3 form a triangle. <3, 4, 8>
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected. Checking the 1-hop neighbors shows that 4, 5, and 3 form a triangle. <3, 4, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles found.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No additional triangles found.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles found.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles found.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No additional triangles found.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No additional triangles found.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 7.
