Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

*Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Connected to 6 and 9.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> Connected to 6 and 5.
    * Pair 4: (9, 5) -> Connected to 9 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Connected to 9 and 10.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Connected to 9 and 8.
    * Pair 3: (10, 8) -> Connected to 10 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 2:

    * Pair 2: (18, 0) -> Connected to 18 and 0.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> Connected to 7 and 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Connected to 9 and 4.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> Connected to 9 and 0.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> Connected to 4 and 0.

*Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 3) -> Connected to 10 and 3.
    * Pair 2: (10, 5) -> Connected to 10 and 5.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> Connected to 3 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Connected to 3 and 15.
    * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> Connected to 3 and 1.
    * Pair 3: (15, 1) -> Connected to 15 and 1.

    * Pair 3: (12, 15) -> Connected to 12 and 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing the process for Nodes 11 to 19:

*Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19: 
    * Since these nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles, they are skipped.

Summarizing the triangles:
*Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
