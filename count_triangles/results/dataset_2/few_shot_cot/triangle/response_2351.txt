Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 3) -> 10 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (10, 11).
    * Pair 3: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 11).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (0, 11).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (0, 11).
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (11, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Triangle with Node 5: (9, 11, 7) -> 9, 11, and 7 are all 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

Continuing this process for Nodes 7 to 14, we can find the total number of triangles.

The triangles found are:
* Node 0: [10, 11, 3]
* Node 1: [0, 11, 2]
* Node 3: [0, 11, 6]
* Node 5: [9, 11, 7]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
