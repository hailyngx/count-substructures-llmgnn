Response:
Following the same process as the example provided for the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 27) -> 9 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected with the edge (0, 27).
    * Pair 2: (9, 21) -> 9 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 24) -> 9 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
