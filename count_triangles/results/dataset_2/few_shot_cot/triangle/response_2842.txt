    * Pair 3: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skip these nodes as they are connected to other nodes we have already considered.
* Node 10:
    * Since it is not connected to any other nodes, we skip this node.
* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 4: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 12, 13, 14:
    * Skip these nodes as they are connected to other nodes we have already considered.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (19, 18) -> 19 and 18 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (19, 1) -> 19 and 1 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:
    * Skip this node as it is connected to other nodes we have already considered.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 11) + 3 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 18) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
