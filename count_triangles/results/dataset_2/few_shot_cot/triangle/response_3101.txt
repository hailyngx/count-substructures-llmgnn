Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 12 are also connected as (4, 0) and (12, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are not connected because (6, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 12 are also connected as (6, 2) and (12, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 9) -> 12 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 12 and 9 are also connected as (12, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 10 are also connected as (3, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 13 and 19 are also connected as (13, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3 and 12 are also connected as (3, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 12.

    * No triangles can be formed by Node 15.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
