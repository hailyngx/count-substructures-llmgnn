Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not connected because (8, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not connected because (8, 10) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No other nodes connected to Node 1, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (15, 9) -> 15 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (15, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 6) -> 15 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (15, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (15, 11) -> 15 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (15, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 24) -> 15 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 9) -> 15 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (15, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (24, 9) -> 24 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (24, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (15, 13) -> 15 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, continuing for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
- For Node 6: 0 triangles found.
- For Node 7: 0 triangles found.
- For Node 8: 0 triangles found.
- For Node 9: 0 triangles found.

Due to the extensive number of nodes, I will now calculate the number of triangles for Nodes 10 to 29 as per the process shown above. Let's continue.
