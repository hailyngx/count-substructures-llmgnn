Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above to find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 28) -> 2 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 24) -> 7 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 23) -> 7 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (17, 28) -> 17 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 15) -> 17 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 2) -> 17 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (28, 15) -> 28 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (28, 2) -> 28 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * etc...
  
Continue this process for the remaining nodes to count the triangles formed by each node. Then sum up the total triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node to get the final answer.
