Response:
Following the step-by-step method described in the example for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 15) -> 17 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 2: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Potential triangle.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 3) -> 11 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Potential triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 19, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
