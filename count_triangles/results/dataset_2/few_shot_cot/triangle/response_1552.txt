Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (7, 13) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Triangle formation skipped.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (9, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (8, 11) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Triangle formation skipped.

* Node 6:
    * Triangle formation skipped.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (9, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as (11, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Triangle formation skipped.

* Node 10:
    * Triangle formation skipped.

* Node 11:
    * Triangle formation skipped.

* Node 12:
    * Triangle formation skipped.

* Node 13:
    * Triangle formation skipped.

* Node 14:
    * Triangle formation skipped.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
