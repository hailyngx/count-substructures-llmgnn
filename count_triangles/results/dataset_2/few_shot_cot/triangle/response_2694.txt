Response:
Following the process described in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> Triangle formed with Node 15, 17.
    * Pair 2: (15, 24) -> Both 15 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 24) -> Triangle formed with Node 17, 24.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> Triangle formed with Node 10, 16.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (25, 29) -> Both 25 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 29) -> Triangle formed with Node 6, 29.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> Triangle formed with Node 13, 17.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No more possible triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

The process continues for Nodes 18 to 29. 

Counting all the triangles found in the graph:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 13) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
