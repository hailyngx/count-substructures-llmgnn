Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    - Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

10. Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
