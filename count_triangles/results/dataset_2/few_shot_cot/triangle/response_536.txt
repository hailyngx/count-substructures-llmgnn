Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not connected as there is no edge (3, 10). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipped pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * All of these nodes don't have at least 2 larger connected nodes for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
