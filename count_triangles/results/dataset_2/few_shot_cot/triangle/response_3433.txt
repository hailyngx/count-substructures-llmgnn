Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [Triangle: <0, 4, 5>]

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> Forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3 [Triangles: <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 9>]

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> Forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> Forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 7: (4, 5) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2 [Triangles: <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 8>]

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [Triangle: <2, 4, 9>]

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * Since these nodes don't have pairs that can form triangles with nodes greater than themselves, they are skipped.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
