Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 5) -> 16 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (10, 17), but since they are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (17, 9) -> 17 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
