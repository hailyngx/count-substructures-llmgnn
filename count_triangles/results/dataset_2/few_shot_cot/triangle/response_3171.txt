Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for counting triangles in the given graph: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 3 and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 9) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 17 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 15 and 18.
    * Pair 2: (15, 5) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 15 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 0) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 15 and 0.
    * Pair 2: (15, 10) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 15 and 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 13 and 16.
    * Pair 2: (13, 5) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 13 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 8 and 17.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 8 and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 13 and 7.
    * Pair 2: (13, 12) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 13 and 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 0 and 17.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 0 and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (19, 17) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 19 and 17.
    * Pair 2: (19, 5) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 19 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> No triangle formed as there is no common neighbor between 1 and 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing with the same process for the remaining nodes.

* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
