Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 2 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each one of them.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 11>, <2, 5, 12>, <4, 9, 13>, <14, 0, 4>. 

So, the final answer is [7].
