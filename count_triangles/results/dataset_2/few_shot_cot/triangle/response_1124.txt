Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed. <0, 4, 9>
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed. <0, 2, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as (6, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as (6, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed. <1, 5, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed. <2, 4, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed. <4, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 7 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected. Triangle formed. <4, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
