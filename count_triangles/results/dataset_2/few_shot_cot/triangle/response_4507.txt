Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No connections, so no triangles.
    
* Node 1:
    <1, 2, 26>
    <1, 11, 6>
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    <2, 18, 5>
    <2, 18, 10>
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    <3, 9, 11>
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    <4, 26, 17>
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    <5, 18, 29>
    <5, 8, 12>
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    <6, 11, 15>
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    <8, 12, 22>
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    No triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    No connections, so no triangles.

    Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 26:
    No triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 27:
    No triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 28:
    No triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 29:
    No triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 1 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
