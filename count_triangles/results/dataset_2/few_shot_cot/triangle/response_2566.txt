Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 25) -> 7 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 25 are also connected as (7, 25) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 3 are also connected as (7, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs can be considered for Node 0 as there are no other nodes greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 13 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs can be considered for Node 1 as there are no other nodes greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 5 are also connected as (7, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 4 are also connected as (7, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs can be considered for Node 2 as there are no other nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No more pairs can be considered for Node 3 as there are no other nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, or 3, as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skip each of these nodes as they have nodes smaller than them only as their neighbors.

* Repeat the same process for Nodes 10 to 29.
