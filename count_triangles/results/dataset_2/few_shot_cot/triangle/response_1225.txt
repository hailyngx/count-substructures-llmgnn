Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 7) -> 18 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (18, 15) -> 18 and 15 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as there is no node greater than 1 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (18, 6) -> 18 and 6 are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as there is no node greater than 4 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 16) -> 17 and 16 are connected directly as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 7) -> 17 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 7) -> 16 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

This process will continue for the remainder of the nodes, and the triangles formed by each node will be added to give the final count. Let's proceed with this process for the remaining nodes.
