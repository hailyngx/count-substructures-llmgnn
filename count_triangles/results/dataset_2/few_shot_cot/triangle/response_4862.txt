Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 2
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (6, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4
    * Pair 6: (9, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 3
    * Pair 7: (9, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 4
    * Pair 8: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 9: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 10: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4
    * Unique triangles involving Node 0: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 9, 8>, <0, 9, 5>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 4
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles involving Node 1: <1, 6, 9>

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 9
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 7: (1, 0) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 8: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 9: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 10: (5, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 4
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles involving Node 2: <2, 7, 3>, <2, 5, 4>

* Node 3: 
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 2
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles involving Node 3: <3, 7, 9>

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include smaller nodes (less than 4).
    * No triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skip these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 8
* Unique triangles: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 9, 8>, <0, 9, 5>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 3>, <2, 5, 4>, <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
