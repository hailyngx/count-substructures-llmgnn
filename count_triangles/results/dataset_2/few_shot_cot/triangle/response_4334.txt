Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected as 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0.
    * Pair 2: (6, 29) -> 6 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (22, 25) -> 22 and 25 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are connected as 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of node 2.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for Nodes 3 to 29:

* Node 3: 0 triangles
* Node 4: 0 triangles
* Node 5: 1 triangle
* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 1 triangle
* Node 8: 1 triangle
* Node 9: 1 triangle
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 1 triangle
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 2 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 1 triangle
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 0 triangles
* Node 22: 0 triangles
* Node 23: 1 triangle
* Node 24: 0 triangles
* Node 25: 1 triangle
* Node 26: 0 triangles
* Node 27: 0 triangles
* Node 28: 1 triangle
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 2 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 1 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 1 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 1 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
[<0, 2, 6>, <2, 7, 0>, <2, 7, 8>, <5, 12, 17>, <7, 8, 10>, <9, 18, 5>, <12, 17, 28>, <16, 23, 13>, <16, 28, 20>, <18, 19, 11>, <25, 1, 6>, <28, 12, 17>, <28, 15, 27>]
