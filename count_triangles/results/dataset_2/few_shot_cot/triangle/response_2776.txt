Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14 as (5, 7) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 as (5, 14) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 as (7, 14) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13 as (4, 9) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 as (4, 13) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14 as (5, 7) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 as (5, 11) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> Does not form a triangle as there is no edge between them even though they are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2.
    * Pair 4: (7, 12) -> Does not form a triangle as there is no edge between them even though they are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14 as (0, 5) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as (0, 14) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10 as (5, 14) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

5. Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10 as (7, 14) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 as (0, 14) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14 as (2, 7) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

7. Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14 as (2, 11) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 as (10, 14) is an edge and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

9. Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8-14) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
