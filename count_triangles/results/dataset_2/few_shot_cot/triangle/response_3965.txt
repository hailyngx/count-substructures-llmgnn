Response:
Let's go step by step to count the triangles in the provided graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 17 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as it does not have 2 neighbors larger than itself.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 17) -> 0 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as it does not have 2 neighbors larger than itself.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as it does not have 2 neighbors larger than itself.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 10 as it does not have 2 neighbors larger than itself.

* Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as they do not have 2 neighbors larger than themselves.

* Node 19:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 19 as it does not have 2 neighbors larger than itself.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
