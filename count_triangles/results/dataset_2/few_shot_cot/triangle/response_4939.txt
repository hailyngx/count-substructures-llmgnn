Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 0 and 10 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 14 are also connected as (6, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 9 and 11 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 5 to 14.

The final number of triangles in the graph is [8]. 
The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 6, 14>, <2, 4, 6>, and <2, 4, 8>.
