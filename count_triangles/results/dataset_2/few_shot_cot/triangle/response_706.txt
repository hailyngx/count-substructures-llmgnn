Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (3, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (4, 7) is not included in the 1-hop neighbor list of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (4, 10) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Let's find the third node to form the triangle.
        * Possible third nodes connected to both 1 and 4: (1, 4) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and 4, but they are not connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 
      
* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2 because (3, 12) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 because (0, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4 because (7, 10) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5 because (7, 12) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7 because (4, 8) is not in the 1-hop neighbor list of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
