Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same method as the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No pair to consider as there are no nodes greater than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
