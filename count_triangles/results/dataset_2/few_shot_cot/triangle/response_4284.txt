Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
