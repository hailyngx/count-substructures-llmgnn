Response:
Following the process outlined earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 16) -> Triangle formed with nodes 1, 16, and 0. <0, 1, 16>
    * No other possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) -> Triangle formed with nodes 14, 19, and 8. <8, 14, 19>
    * Pair 3: (14, 5) -> Triangle formed with nodes 5, 14, and 8. <8, 5, 14>
    * Pair 4: (14, 9) -> Triangle formed with nodes 9, 14, and 8. <8, 9, 14>
    * No other possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 2) -> Triangle formed with nodes 11, 2, and 9. <9, 11, 2>
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 13) -> Triangle formed with nodes 2, 13, and 9. <9, 2, 13>
    * Pair 5: (13, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 14) -> Triangle formed with nodes 13, 14, and 9. <9, 13, 14>
    * Pair 7: (13, 2) -> Triangle formed with nodes 13, 2, and 9. <9, 13, 2>
    * No other possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * Nodes 10, 12, 15, 16, and 17 are smaller than Node 19, so they are skipped.
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Nodes 10 to 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 4 (Node 9) + 0 (Nodes 10 to 19) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
