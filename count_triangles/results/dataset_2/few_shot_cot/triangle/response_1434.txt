Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are directly connected as mentioned in the edge list. No additional node to complete a triangle with 0 and 5.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are directly connected as mentioned in the edge list. No additional node to complete a triangle with 0 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are directly connected as mentioned in the edge list. No additional node to complete a triangle with 1 and 2.

    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
