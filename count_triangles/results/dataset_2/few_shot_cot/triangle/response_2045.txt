Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 6 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4 to avoid duplication.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are no pairs available.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7 to avoid duplication.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
