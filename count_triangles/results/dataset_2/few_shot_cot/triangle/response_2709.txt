Response:
Following the example provided and the given graph details, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 3 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 2 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
