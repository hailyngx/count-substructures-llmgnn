Response:
Following the step-by-step example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> Nodes 7 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> Nodes 13 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Nodes 9 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Nodes 11 and 14 are directly connected. No third node connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 16) -> Nodes 11 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 19) -> Nodes 11 and 19 are directly connected. No third node connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 16) -> Nodes 14 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> Nodes 14 and 18 are directly connected. No third node connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> Nodes 16 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> Nodes 8 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Nodes 8 and 12 are directly connected. No third node connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Nodes 9 and 14 are directly connected. No third node connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
