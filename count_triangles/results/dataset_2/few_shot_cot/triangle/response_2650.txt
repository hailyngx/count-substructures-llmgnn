Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the method shown in the example provided, here is the step-by-step process to count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 3 and 9.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 7 and 9.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 3 and 9.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 4 and 9.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 6 and 9.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 1 and 9.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with node 4 and 5.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with node 4 and 6.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 6 and 8.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 7 and 8.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 7

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed with node 5 and 6.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 5 and 9.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 5 and 4.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * As there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, no triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 7 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
