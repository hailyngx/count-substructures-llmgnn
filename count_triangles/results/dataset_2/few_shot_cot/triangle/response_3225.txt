Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue this process for all remaining nodes and calculate the total number of triangles formed. 

Once you have completed the calculations for each node, please provide the final answer inside brackets [] with the unique triangles found listed as <node1, node2, node3>.
