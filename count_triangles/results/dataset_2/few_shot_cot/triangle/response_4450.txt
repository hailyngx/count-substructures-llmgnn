Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.

Given the results above, the total number of triangles in the graph is [0].
