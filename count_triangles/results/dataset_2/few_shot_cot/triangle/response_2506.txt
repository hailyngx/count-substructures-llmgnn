Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (11, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (11, 12) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as (8, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are not directly connected as (5, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 10 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the output should be: [1]
