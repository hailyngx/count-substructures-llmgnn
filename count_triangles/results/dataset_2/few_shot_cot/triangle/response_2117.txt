Response:
Following the process described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 15.
    - Pair 2: (0, 18) -> Node 0 and Node 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 17.
    - Pair 2: (5, 19) -> Node 5 and Node 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 15.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (0, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    - Pair 2: (0, 17) -> Node 0 and Node 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - No connections to form triangles with other nodes.
    - No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 15.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    - No triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    - No triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    - Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    - Pair 2: (2, 13) -> Node 2 and Node 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    - Pair 1: (12, 14) -> Node 12 and Node 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (12, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Node 9 and Node 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 11

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
