Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
Following the method shown in the example, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Connected through edge list. 
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Connected through edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pairs cannot be formed involving smaller nodes.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node. 

* Node 7:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No pairs can be formed with Nodes 8 and 9 as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
