Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Connected to both 9 and 10. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> Connected to both 9 and 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> Connected to both 9 and 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 5) -> Connected to both 10 and 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 1) -> Connected to both 10 and 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 1) -> Connected to both 5 and 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Connected to both 4 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip other pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 16) -> Connected to both 3 and 16. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 7) - Both 11 and 7 are adjacent to node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping other pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (18, 12) -> Connected to both 18 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (15, 2) - Both 15 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of node 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) - Both 9 and 18 are adjacent to node 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Connected to both 10 and 14. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> Connected to both 17 and 19. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) - Both 6 and 18 are adjacent to node 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) - Both 11 and 14 are adjacent to node 10. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skip these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
