Response:
Following the step-by-step counting of triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (16, 1) -> Triangle formed: <1, 16, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (15, 2) -> Triangle formed: <2, 15, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Triangle formed: <3, 9, 18>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> Triangle formed: <4, 16, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (14, 5) -> Triangle formed: <5, 14, 0>
    * Pair 2: (17, 5) -> Triangle formed: <5, 17, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Triangle formed: <6, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 8) -> Triangle formed: <8, 13, 10>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
