Response:
Let's begin the process of counting triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 4) -> 12 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 2 and 15 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 15) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 18 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 18) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Let's continue this process for Nodes 5 to 19.
