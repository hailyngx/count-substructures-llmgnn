Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (27, 28) -> Nodes 27 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (27, 28) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (27, 15) -> Nodes 27 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (27, 5) -> Nodes 27 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (28, 15) -> Nodes 28 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (28, 5) -> Nodes 28 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (28, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (15, 5) -> Nodes 15 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (27, 13) -> Nodes 27 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (27, 8) -> Nodes 27 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (27, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 8) -> Nodes 13 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (13, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for all nodes in the graph would eventually give the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's apply the same steps to all nodes and calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.
