Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <0, 5, 9>
  * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <0, 5, 7>
  * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <0, 5, 2>
  * Pair 5: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 7: (9, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 3: <0, 9, 3>
  * Pair 8: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 9: (7, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <0, 7, 4>
  * Pair 10: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 3: <1, 5, 9>
  * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <0, 5, 7>
  * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <2, 4, 7>
  * Pair 5: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 7: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 8: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 5: <1, 9, 5>
  * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
  * No pairs can be made with at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
