Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph. 

* Start by checking each node and its 1-hop neighbors to find the triangles they form. 

* Then, for each node, consider the pairs of its 1-hop neighbors that are also connected directly.

Here we go:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 26) -> Direct edge between 5 and 26 not in the list, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 18) -> Direct edge between 5 and 18 not in the list, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (26, 18) -> Direct edge between 26 and 18 is in the list, triangle formed: <0, 5, 26>. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 11) -> Direct edge between 2 and 11 not in the list, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Direct edge between 2 and 5 not in the list, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 1) -> Direct edge between 2 and 1 is in the list, triangle formed: <1, 2, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> Direct edge between 6 and 12 is in the list, triangle formed: <2, 6, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 27) -> Direct edge between 9 and 27 not in the list, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Direct edge between 9 and 10 not in the list, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (27, 10) -> Direct edge between 27 and 10 not in the list, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) -> Direct edge between 12 and 17 is in the list, triangle formed: <4, 12, 17>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, we find triangles for Nodes 6, 8, 11, 12, and 17.

Calculating the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles found for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 17) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
