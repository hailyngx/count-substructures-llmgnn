Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 4, 12>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 8>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (9, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (9, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (9, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 9, 7>

Continue this process for Nodes 2 to 14, and then sum up the total triangles found.

[<0, 4, 12>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 9, 7>]
