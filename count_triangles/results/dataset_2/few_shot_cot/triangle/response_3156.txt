Response:
Following the same method used in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph step by step for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 8 are not connected.
        * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 12 are connected.
        * Pair 4: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
        * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected.
        * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
        * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected.
        * Pair 5: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, so no triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
        * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2, so no triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
        * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected.
        * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
        * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected.
        * Pair 5: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3, so no triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
        * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4, so no triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Nodes 5, 6, and 7:
        * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there are no two other nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Calculating the total number of triangles by summing the triangles found for each node: 
1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 7.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
