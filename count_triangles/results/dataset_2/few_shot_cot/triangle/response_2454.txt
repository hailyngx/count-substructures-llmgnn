Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. (7, 0, 13) forms a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. (4, 1, 16) forms a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. (4, 1, 8) forms a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and they are connected. (5, 4, 10) forms a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7 will follow in a similar fashion to the previous nodes.

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 11, 12, and 13 will follow in a similar fashion to the previous nodes.

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 17, 18, and 19 do not have enough larger numbered nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 2 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
