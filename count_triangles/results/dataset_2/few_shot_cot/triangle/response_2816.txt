Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 1). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (9, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (9, 1). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (7, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (7, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

I will continue this process for the rest of the nodes to find all the triangles in the graph. Let's calculate.
