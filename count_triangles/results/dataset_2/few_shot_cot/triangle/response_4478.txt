Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, here is the calculation for finding the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 28) -> 10 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 21) -> 10 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 29) -> 10 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 9) -> 10 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (28, 21) -> 28 and 21 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (28, 29) -> 28 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (28, 9) -> 28 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (21, 29) -> 21 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (21, 9) -> 21 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (29, 9) -> 29 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * ... (continue this process for Node 1)

Please carry on with this process for each remaining node until all possible triangles are counted. When you're finished, provide the final answer inside brackets [] following the example format.
