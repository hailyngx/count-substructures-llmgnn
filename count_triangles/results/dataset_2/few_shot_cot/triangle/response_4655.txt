Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. 
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. 
    * Pair 2: (14, 8) -> 14 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 to 19:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with nodes 8 to 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8 to 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
