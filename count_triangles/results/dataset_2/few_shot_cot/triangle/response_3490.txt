Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 9 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
