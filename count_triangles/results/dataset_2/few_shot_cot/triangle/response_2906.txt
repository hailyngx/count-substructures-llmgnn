Response:
Following the same procedure described in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph step by step by considering each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) - Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) - Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) - Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) - Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) - Not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) - Connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) - Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) - Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) - Connected.
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) - Connected.
    * Pair 3: (12, 1) - Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (12, 2) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) - Connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) - Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 or 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) - Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 or 7 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 6 as they are smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 9, or 10 as they are smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 or 7 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [8].
