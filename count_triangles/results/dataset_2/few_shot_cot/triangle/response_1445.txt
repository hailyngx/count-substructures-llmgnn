Response:
Following the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 16 are not connected as there is no edge (4, 16) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 13 and 16 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than all other nodes.
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (17, 19) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> Both 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 16 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are not connected as there is no edge (10, 18) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are connected as 10 and 2 are directly connected (2, 10) in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue the counting process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 and finally calculate the total number of triangles by summing up all the triangles found.

Finally, provide the total number of triangles in the graph inside brackets.
