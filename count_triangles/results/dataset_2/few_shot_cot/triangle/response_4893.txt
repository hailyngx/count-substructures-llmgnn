Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> Connected, 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors. Checking for common nodes: 8 - 3, 6 - 4. Checking if they are connected: (3, 4) is an edge. Triangle <3, 6, 8> formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 6: (9, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 7: (9, 0) -> Connected, 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors. Checking for common nodes: 0 - 6, 9 - 6. Checking if they are connected: (0, 6) is an edge. Triangle <0, 6, 9> formed.
    * Pair 8: (1, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Connected, 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors. Checking for common nodes: 9 - 6, 3 - 7. Checking if they are connected: (6, 7) is an edge. Triangle <6, 7, 9> formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 4: (1, 3) -> Connected, 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors. Checking for common nodes: 1 - 5, 3 - 7. Checking if they are connected: (5, 7) is an edge. Triangle <1, 5, 7> formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Connected, 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors. Checking for common nodes: 1 - 5, 7 - 4. Checking if they are connected: (5, 4) is an edge. Triangle <1, 4, 5> formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Connected, 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors. Checking for common nodes: 6 - 0, 7 - 1. Checking if they are connected: (0, 1) is an edge. Triangle <0, 1, 6> formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Connected, 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors. Checking for common nodes: 1 - 7, 3 - 7. Checking if they are connected: (7, 1) is an edge. Triangle <1, 3, 7> formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
