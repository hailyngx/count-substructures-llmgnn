Response:
Following the approach taken in the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 25) -> They are connected through Node 5 and Node 25, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    - Pair 2: (5, 18) -> They are connected through Node 5 and Node 18, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    - Pair 3: (25, 18) -> They are connected through Node 25 and Node 18, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 28) -> They are connected through Node 3 and Node 28, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> They are connected through Node 3 and Node 7, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    - Pair 3: (28, 7) -> They are connected through Node 28 and Node 7, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (13, 11) -> They are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> They are connected through Node 1 and Node 8, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (12, 19) -> They are connected through Node 12 and Node 19, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    - Pair 2: (12, 16) -> They are connected through Node 12 and Node 16, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    - Pair 3: (19, 16) -> They are connected through Node 19 and Node 16, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - These nodes have already been considered in triangles with smaller numbered nodes.

Now, let's continue this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (6, 22) -> They are connected through Node 6 and Node 22, forming a triangle with Node 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (2, 24) -> They are connected through Node 2 and Node 24, forming a triangle with Node 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (8, 19) -> They are connected through Node 8 and Node 19, forming a triangle with Node 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 13, 14, and 15:
    - These nodes have already been considered in triangles with smaller numbered nodes.

Continuing:

* Node 16:
    - Pair 1: (17, 19) -> They are connected through Node 17 and Node 19, forming a triangle with Node 16.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    - Pair 1: (22, 28) -> They are connected through Node 22 and Node 28, forming a triangle with Node 17.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 18, 19, and 20:
    - These nodes have already been considered in triangles with smaller numbered nodes.

Continuing:

* Node 21:
    - Pair 1: (26, 4) -> They are connected through Node 26 and Node 4, forming a triangle with Node 21.
    - Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 22:
    - Pair 1: (26, 28) -> They are connected through Node 26 and Node 28, forming a triangle with Node 22.
    - Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 23:
    - Pair 1: (9, 26) -> They are connected through Node 9 and Node 26, forming a triangle with Node 23.
    - Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
    - These nodes have already been considered in triangles with smaller numbered nodes.

Summing up the triangles for all nodes, we have:
Total triangles = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 1 (Node 21) + 1 (Node 22) + 1 (Node 23) = 24

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [24].
