Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> Triangle formed: <1, 7, 12>
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 9>
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 9, 6>
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> Triangle formed: <3, 6, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed: <4, 9, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed: <5, 9, 14>
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Triangle formed: <5, 9, 10>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed: <6, 9, 14>
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Triangle formed: <6, 9, 10>
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> Triangle formed: <6, 9, 11>
    * Pair 4: (10, 11) -> Triangle formed: <6, 10, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as they are not the smallest numbered nodes with at least 2 nodes greater than them for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 4 (Node 6) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
