Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (6, 1)     -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (6, 9)     -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (3, 5)     -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (3, 7)     -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (3, 8)     -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (5, 7)     -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (1, 5)     -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (1, 5)     -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
  * Pair 1: (6, 9)     -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1
  
* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9 triangles] in the given graph.
