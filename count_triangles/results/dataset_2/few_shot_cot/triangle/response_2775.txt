Response:
Following the same method used in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are connected through Node 0, and indeed there is an edge (5, 11) in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (triangles: <0, 5, 11>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected through Node 1, but there is no edge between them in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are connected through Node 2, and indeed there is an edge (5, 11) in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (triangles: <2, 5, 11>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are connected through Node 3, but there is no edge between them in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are connected through Node 4, and indeed there is an edge (6, 10) in the list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are connected through Node 4, but there is no edge between them in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (triangles: <4, 6, 10>)

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 8) -> 14 and 8 are connected through Node 7, but there is no edge between them in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 7 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are connected through Node 10, and indeed there is an edge (1, 12) in the list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are connected through Node 10, and indeed there is an edge (4, 10) in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (triangles: <1, 10, 12>, <4, 6, 10>)

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected through Node 12, and indeed there is an edge (9, 12) in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (triangles: <9, 12, 5>)

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are connected through Node 13, but there is no edge between them in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3 and 7 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 12) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
