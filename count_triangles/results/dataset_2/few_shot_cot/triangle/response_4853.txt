Response:
Following the same method explained in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Skipped.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that involve Nodes with smaller numbers.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes with smaller numbers. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 6 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 6 or 7 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
