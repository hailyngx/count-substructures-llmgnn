Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (17, 27) -> 17 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 17 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the graph.
    - Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are not connected, even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    - Pair 3: (6, 23) -> 6 and 23 are not connected, even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    - Pair 4: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are not connected, even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    - Pair 5: (8, 23) -> 8 and 23 are not connected, even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    - Pair 6: (11, 23) -> 11 and 23 are not connected, even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skipping all pairs involving nodes 0 and 1.
    - Pair 1: (13, 21) -> 13 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the graph.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (19, 21) -> 19 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as per the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

... Continuing this process for the rest of the nodes ...

Calculating all the triangles and counting each unique triangle once, the final answer is:
[<4, 10, 17>, <8, 19, 26>, <0, 17, 27>, <6, 13, 21>, <6, 13, 14>, <6, 18, 16>, <25, 18, 24>]
