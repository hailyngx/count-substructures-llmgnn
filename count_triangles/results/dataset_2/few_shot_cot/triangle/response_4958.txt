Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 2) -> Connected directly as (8, 2). Potential triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Connected directly as (4, 8). Potential triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Connected directly as (7, 8). Potential triangle.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 2) -> Connected directly as (8, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> Connected directly as (8, 3). Potential triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Connected directly as (5, 7). Potential triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Connected directly as (4, 8). Potential triangle.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Connected directly as (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No potential triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Connected directly as (9, 6). Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Connected directly as (9, 7). Potential triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> Connected directly as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No potential triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No potential triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
