Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No unique triangles can be formed starting from Node 4 as all neighbors are already covered by larger nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * No unique triangles can be formed starting from these nodes as they all have 1-hop neighbors that are smaller than them.
    * Total triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
