Response:
Following the methodology explained in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Connected via edge (0, 2) and edge (0, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Connected via edge (1, 6) and edge (1, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Connected via edge (2, 3) and edge (2, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Connected via edge (3, 5) and edge (3, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> Connected via edge (3, 2). No other connected nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> Connected via edge (6, 4) and edge (6, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Connected via edge (6, 7) and edge (6, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Connected via edge (7, 8) and edge (7, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs as there aren't nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
