Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 4) -> 14 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 1) -> 14 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 0, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 since it is smaller than node 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Following the same steps, these nodes do not form any triangles as the pairs either do not have a connection or do not create a triangle.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Following the same steps, these nodes do not form any triangles as the pairs either do not have a connection or do not create a triangle.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (18, 16) -> 18 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, but they are not directly connected as (18, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 5) -> 18 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, but they are not directly connected as (18, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 5) -> 16 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are connected as (16, 15, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Following the same steps, these nodes do not form any triangles as the pairs either do not have a connection or do not create a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

Thus, the answer is [2].
