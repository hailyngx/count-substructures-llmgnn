Response:
Following the same process as described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 0 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 1. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 3 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 2. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 7 and 3.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Already considered with Node 1. Skip.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are directly connected, and 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 5 and 2.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 2. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 2 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Already considered with Node 1. Skip.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 3. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 3 and 6.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> Already considered with Node 2. Skip.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 3. No other 1-hop neighbor forms a triangle with 3 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
