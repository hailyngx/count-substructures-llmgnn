Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have 0 triangles each.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
