Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>)

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 9, 13>)

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles found are:  
<[0, 2, 5], [0, 2, 6], [3, 9, 13]>.

So, the final answer is [3].
