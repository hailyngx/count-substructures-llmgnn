Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for counting triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (18, 6) -> 18 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 3: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 do not form triangles with other nodes as there are not at least 3 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8-19) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
