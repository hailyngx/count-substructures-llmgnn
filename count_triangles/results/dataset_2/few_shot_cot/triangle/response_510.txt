Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as outlined in the example provided, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph.

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Both 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    
    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> Both 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, they are connected as (5, 16) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    
    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> Both 9 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> Both 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    
    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> Both 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.

    * Node 10:
        * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> Both 16 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 11:
        * Since Node 11 only has one neighbor, no triangles can be formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 12:
        * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> Both 14 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, they are connected as (14, 19) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
    * Node 13:
        * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 13.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    
    * Node 14:
        * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 14.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    
    * Node 15:
        * Since Node 15 only has one neighbor, no triangles can be formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
    * Node 16:
        * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 16.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.
    
    * Node 17:
        * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 17.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.
    
    * Node 18:
        * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 18.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.
    
    * Node 19:
        * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 19.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.

    Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
