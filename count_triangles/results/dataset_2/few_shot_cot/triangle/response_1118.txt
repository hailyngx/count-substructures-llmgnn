Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example given, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 1 are also connected as (0, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 3 are also connected as (0, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 0 and 5 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 9 are also directly connected as (0, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 2 are also connected as (1, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also directly connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are also connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 6 are also directly connected as (2, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 2 and 9 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 7 are also directly connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

This process will continue for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 to count the triangles formed:

* Node 5: 
    * Skipped since there aren't enough nodes greater than 5 to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skipped since there aren't enough nodes greater than 6 to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skipped since there aren't enough nodes greater than 8 to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skipped since there aren't enough nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, and <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the answer is [8].
