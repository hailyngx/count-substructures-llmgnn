Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (0, 11) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 17 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 6) -> 15 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (16, 11) -> 16 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 16 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 12.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Node 14 is not connected to any other nodes.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 16, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 17, and 3 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 18.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 
The answer is [7].
