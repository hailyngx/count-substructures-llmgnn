Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (12, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (14, 5) -> 14 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (14, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (10, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 5) -> 10 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 10 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (12, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 3 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 11 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
