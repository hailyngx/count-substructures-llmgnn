Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 9) -> 15 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 11) -> 15 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 7) -> 15 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 17) -> 15, and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 5) -> 15 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (15, 8) -> 15 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3, and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 6 through 19.

The triangles found are:
* Node 0: 0 triangles
* Node 1: 0 triangles
* Node 2: 0 triangles
* Node 3: 0 triangles
* Node 4: 0 triangles
* Node 5: 0 triangles
* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [0].
