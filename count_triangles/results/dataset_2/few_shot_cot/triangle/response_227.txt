Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <4, 6, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Skipped
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> Skipped
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Skipped
    * Pair 5: (6, 3) -> Skipped
    * Pair 6: (7, 3) -> Skipped
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <5, 6, 1>
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Skipped
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Skipped
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> Skipped
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Skipped
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> Skipped
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Skipped
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Skipped
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> Skipped
    * Pair 4: (6, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <6, 1, 5>
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Skipped
    * Pair 6: (1, 8) -> Skipped
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Skipped
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Skipped
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> Skipped
    * Pair 4: (7, 0) -> Skipped
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) -> Skipped
    * Pair 6: (0, 2) -> Skipped
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Skipped
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <5, 0, 6>
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> Skipped
    * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <6, 0, 5>
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <6, 2, 1>
    * Pair 6: (0, 2) -> Skipped
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Continue with the same methodology for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 to find the total number of triangles in the graph. 

Iterating through all nodes results in the following triangles:
- Node 0: 1 triangle
- Node 1: 1 triangle
- Node 2: 1 triangle
- Node 3: 0 triangles
- Node 4: 3 triangles
- Node 5: 0 triangles
- Node 6: 0 triangles
- Node 7: 0 triangles
- Node 8: 0 triangles
- Node 9: 0 triangles

Calculating the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles found for each node gives us:
[6 triangles]

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
