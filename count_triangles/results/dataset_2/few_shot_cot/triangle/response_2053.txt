Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected.
    - Pair 2: (0, 17) -> 0 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not connected.
    - Triangle formed with Node 0: <0, 2, 4>

2. **Node 1**:
    - Skip connections with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. **Node 2**:
    - Skip connections with nodes 0 and 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    - Pair 3: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not connected.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. **Node 3**:
    - Skip connections with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. **Node 4**:
    - Skip connections with nodes 0, 1, and 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    - Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    - Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    - Triangle formed with Node 4: <4, 11, 12>

6. **Node 5**:
    - Skip connections with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6**:
    - Skip connections with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. **Node 7**:
    - Skip connections with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. **Node 8**:
    - Pair 1: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8 but are not directly connected.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. **Node 9**:
    - Skip connections with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. **Node 10**:

18. **Node 17**:
    - Skip connections with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

19. **Node 18**:
    - Skip connections with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

20. **Node 19**:
    - Skip connections with smaller nodes.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Counting all the triangles formed by the smallest numbered nodes, we get:
[<0, 2, 4>, <4, 11, 12>]

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
