    * Pair 2: (2, 5) - Node 2 and Node 5 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) - Node 2 and Node 6 are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) - Node 2 and Node 8 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Node 3 and Node 4 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - Node 3 and Node 6 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) - Node 3 and Node 7 are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 0) - Node 3 and Node 0 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Node 5 and Node 9 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) - Node 6 and Node 0 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) - Node 6 and Node 2 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) - Node 6 and Node 3 are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 5) - Node 6 and Node 5 are directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) - Node 6 and Node 9 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Node 7 and Node 8 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) - Node 7 and Node 9 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) - Node 7 and Node 0 are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) - Node 7 and Node 3 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - Node 9 and Node 4 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [0].
