Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1, 6, 8, 13, and 14 as they are smaller than 0.
    * No triangles formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 3, 4, 6, and 14 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 3, 6, 7, 10, and 12 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 4, 7, 8, and 13 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 5 and 11 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 9 and 13 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 14 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 12 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 11 and 12 are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 9 as it is smaller than 8.
    * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 14 as it is smaller than 9.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
