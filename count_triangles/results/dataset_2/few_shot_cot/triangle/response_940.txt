Response:
Following the example provided, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 13), (0, 14).
  * Pair 2: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (9, 18).
  * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (1, 19).
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 12).
  * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 8).
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 9:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 10:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 11:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 12:
  * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are indirectly connected via node 12. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are directly connected as (12, 19).
  * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 14:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 15:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 16:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 17:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 18:
  * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 18, and they are indirectly connected via node 18. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 18, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 18) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
