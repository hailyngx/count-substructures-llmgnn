Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2)

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (9, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (6, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (6, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (6, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (6, 0). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (9, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (9, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 1). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (6, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue the process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 following the same method. Finally, count the total number of triangles found in the graph and output the answer inside brackets [].
