Response:
Following the same method as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (10, 11) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge (10, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge (0, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [10].
