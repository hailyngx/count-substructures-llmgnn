Response:
Following the method described in the example above to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 13 are also connected as (7, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 13 are also connected as (1, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 8) -> 13 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 13 and 8 are also connected as (13, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 1 are also connected as (9, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 13 are also connected as (9, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 3 and 13 are also connected as (3, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 8.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

[<1, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 3, 13>, <3, 1, 13>, <3, 8, 13>, <3, 1, 13>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 5>]
