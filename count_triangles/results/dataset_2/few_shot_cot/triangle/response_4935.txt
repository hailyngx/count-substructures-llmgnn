Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are connected as (2, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 8), but since 3 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
