Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) - 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) - 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) - 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) - 5 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) - 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs found to form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 5 and 6:
    * Nodes 5 and 6 only have connections within themselves and no triangles can be formed with larger numbered nodes.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No pairs found to form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No pairs found to form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Similarly, no triangles can be formed with larger numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Nodes 9-14) = 2.

Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
