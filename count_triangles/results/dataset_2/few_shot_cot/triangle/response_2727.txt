Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 9 and 14)
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 9 and 7)
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> Form a triangle <9, 0, 11>
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 9 and 2)
    * Pair 5: (14, 7) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 14 and 7)
    * Pair 6: (14, 2) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 14 and 2)
    * Pair 7: (14, 0) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 14 and 0)
    * Pair 8: (7, 2) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 7 and 2)
    * Pair 9: (7, 0) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 7 and 0)
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 3 and 2)
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 3 and 14)
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Form a triangle <3, 1, 4>
    * Pair 4: (3, 12) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 3 and 12)
    * Pair 5: (2, 14) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 2 and 14)
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 2 and 4)
    * Pair 7: (2, 12) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 2 and 12)
    * Pair 8: (14, 4) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 14 and 4)
    * Pair 9: (14, 12) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 14 and 12)
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 5 and 1)
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 5 and 0)
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 5 and 7)
    * Pair 4: (1, 0) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 1 and 0)
    * Pair 5: (1, 7) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 1 and 7)
    * Pair 6: (0, 7) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 0 and 7)
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 5 and 1)
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 5 and 13)
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 5 and 4)
    * Pair 4: (1, 13) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 1 and 13)
    * Pair 5: (1, 4) -> Form a triangle <1, 3, 4>
    * Pair 6: (13, 4) -> Not a triangle (missing edge between 13 and 4)
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Since the other nodes have fewer than 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles, we can stop the process here.

Summarizing the triangles:
[<3, 1, 4>, <9, 0, 11>]

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
