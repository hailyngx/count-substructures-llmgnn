Response:
Following the same method as described in the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
[<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 12>, <4, 8, 19>, <8, 12, 2>]
