Response:
Following the same method as described in the example for counting triangles in the graph, we will start by iterating through each node and calculating the total number of triangles that can be formed with that node as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 3 are connected as (5, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 4 are connected as (5, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Already counted in Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 4) -> 13 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 7 are connected as (9, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 10) -> 11 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 11 and 10 are connected as (11, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
