Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 4 are connected as (0, 4) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2**:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 4 are connected as (0, 4) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3**:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4**:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5**:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6**:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7**:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. **Node 8 and Node 9**:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
