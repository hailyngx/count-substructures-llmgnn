Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 10) shown in the edge list, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0).
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes (0, 1) are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes (0, 1, 2) are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs involving smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3) are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (7, 11) shown in the edge list, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's continue this process for the remaining nodes in the graph to find the total number of triangles.
