Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0: Not connected to any other nodes.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> Both 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 10 are directly connected as (5, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 11 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> Both 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Both 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 12 are directly connected as (7, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
  * No triangles found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * No triangles found with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7: 
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> Both 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 6 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9: 
    * No triangles found with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12: 
    * No triangles found with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13: 
    * No triangles found with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14: 
    * No triangles found with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15: 
    * No triangles found with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16: 
    * No triangles found with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17: 
    * No triangles found with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18: 
    * No triangles found with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19: 
    * No triangles found with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node:
[1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 10) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0] = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
[<1, 5, 10>, <11, 2, 3>, <3, 4, 14>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 12>, <5, 7, 10>, <5, 10, 1>, <7, 10, 11>]
