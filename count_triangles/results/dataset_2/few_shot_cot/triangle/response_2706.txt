Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No valid triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * Following the process, we can find triangles involving these nodes:
        - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9, 10, and 11:
    * Following the process, we can find triangles involving these nodes:
        - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 12, 13, and 14:
    * Following the process, we can find triangles involving these nodes:
        - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 11) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
