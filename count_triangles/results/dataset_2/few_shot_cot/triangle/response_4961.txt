Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) - Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected as given in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (16, 12) - Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 20:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 21:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 22:
    * Pair 1: (24, 25) - Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 22, and they are connected as given in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 23:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 24:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 25:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 26:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 27:
    * No pairs or triangles can be formed with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 28:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 29:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles calculated:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 22) = 2

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
