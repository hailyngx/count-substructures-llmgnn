Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

1. **Node 0:**
   - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Node 1 and Node 2 are connected via the edge (1, 2).
   - Pair 2: (1, 13) -> Node 1 and Node 13 are not connected.
   - Pair 3: (2, 13) -> Node 2 and Node 13 are not connected.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
   
2. **Node 1:**
   - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
   - No other node pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest. 
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
   - No other nodes left to form triangles as all others are smaller.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
   - Skip all possible pairs as there aren't nodes greater than Node 3 to form a triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
   - Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Node 11 and Node 17 are connected via the edge (11, 17).
   - Pair 2: (11, 19) -> Node 11 and Node 19 are connected via the edge (11, 19).
   - Pair 3: (17, 19) -> Node 17 and Node 19 are connected via the edge (17, 19).
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Continue this process for Nodes 5 to 19:**
   - Node 5: 0, Node 7: 0, Node 8: 0, Node 9: 0, Node 10: 0, Node 14: 2, Node 15: 0, Node 16: 0, Node 17: 0, Node 18: 0, Node 19: 0

7. **Calculate the total number of triangles:**
   - Add up the triangles found for each node: 1 (0) + 0 (1) + 0 (2) + 0 (3) + 1 (4) + 0 (5) + 0 (6) + 0 (7) + 0 (8) + 0 (9) + 0 (10) + 2 (14) + 0 (15) + 0 (16) + 0 (17) + 0 (18) + 0 (19) = 4
   - Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

8. **Output the answer in brackets:**
   - [4]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the provided graph is 4.
