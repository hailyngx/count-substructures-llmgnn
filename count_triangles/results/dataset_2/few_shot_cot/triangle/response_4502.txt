Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Form a triangle with Node 1 and Node 2 as they are connected to each other and to Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Form a triangle with Node 1 and Node 3 as they are connected to each other and to Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> Form a triangle with Node 1 and Node 14 as they are connected to each other and to Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (1, 12) -> No triangle formed as Node 12 is not directly connected to Node 0.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as Node 2 and Node 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 14) -> Form a triangle with Node 2 and Node 14 as they are connected to each other and to Node 0.
    * Pair 7: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed as Node 3 and Node 14 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as Node 2 and Node 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> Form a triangle with Node 2 and Node 14 as they are connected to each other and to Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed as Node 3 and Node 14 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No new triangles formed as all pairs involve nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed as Node 10 and Node 12 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed as Node 5 and Node 10 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed as Node 7 and Node 11 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 7 and Node 12 as they are connected to each other and to Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed as Node 10 and Node 14 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as Node 8 and Node 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed as Node 8 and Node 12 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> No triangle formed as Node 9 and Node 11 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed as Node 9 and Node 13 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed as Node 11 and Node 13 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with nodes larger than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
