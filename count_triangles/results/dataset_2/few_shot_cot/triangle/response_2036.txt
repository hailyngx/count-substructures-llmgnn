Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (20, 24) -> 20 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (20, 28) -> 20 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (20, 13) -> 20 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (16, 28) -> 16 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (21, 27) -> 21 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (10, 21) -> 10 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (22, 26) -> 22 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 29: Skipped due to no other nodes to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
        
The unique triangles found are:
[<3, 20, 24>, <3, 20, 28>, <4, 16, 28>, <7, 10, 21>]
