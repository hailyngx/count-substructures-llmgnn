Response:
Following the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the graph you provided:
    
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 4>
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Triangle formed: <1, 9, 6>
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> Triangle formed: <2, 7, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Triangle formed: <3, 5, 9>
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed: <3, 7, 4>
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 9, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed: <4, 5, 0>
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed: <4, 6, 9>
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <4, 7, 0>
    * Pair 4: (7, 4) -> Triangle formed: <4, 7, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed: <5, 9, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Triangle formed: <6, 9, 1>
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> Triangle formed: <6, 2, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> Triangle formed: <7, 3, 5>
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> Triangle formed: <7, 2, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Triangle formed: <8, 9, 1>
    * Pair 2: (8, 0) -> Triangle formed: <8, 0, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Triangle formed: <9, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 20.

Therefore, there are [20] triangles in the given graph.
