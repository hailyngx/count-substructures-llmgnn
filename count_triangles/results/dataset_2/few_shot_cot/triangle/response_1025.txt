Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (1, 8) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 2, as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 4, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4, as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, or 5 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 4 or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as (0, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
