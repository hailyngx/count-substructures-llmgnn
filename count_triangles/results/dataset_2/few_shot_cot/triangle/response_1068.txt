Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 2

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 6 as they are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6 as they are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 6 as it is greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8, 9 as they are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with no higher numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 8), but since 6 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with no higher numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with no higher numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
