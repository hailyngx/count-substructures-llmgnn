Response:
Following the same step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (20, 24) -> 20 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (20, 24) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (20, 12) -> 20 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (20, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (24, 12) -> 24 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (24, 0) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 25) -> 17 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (17, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 7) -> 17 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (17, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (25, 7) -> 25 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (25, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (26, 5) -> 26 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (26, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (26, 9) -> 26 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (26, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 13) -> 26 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (26, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (21, 24) -> 21 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (20, 23) -> 20 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (20, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (15, 5) -> 15 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (15, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (15, 19) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (29, 2) -> 29 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 9, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (29, 4) -> 29 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (29, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
