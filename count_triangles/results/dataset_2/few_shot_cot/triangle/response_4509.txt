Response:
Following the same method as in the example given, we will find the total number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as mentioned in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as per the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 7) -> 15 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 2) -> 16 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as mentioned in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
  
* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 to 19: Skipped due to the unavailability of at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4 triangles] in the given graph.
