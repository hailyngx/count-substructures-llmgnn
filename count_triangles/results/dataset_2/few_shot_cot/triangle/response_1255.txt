Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Skipped because 5 and 13 are both smaller than 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 6) -> Skipped because 13 is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 5: (13, 12) -> Skipped because 13 and 12 are both smaller than 0.
    * Pair 6: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> Both 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 7) -> Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 11) -> Both 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 3) -> Skipped because 3 is smaller than 9.
    * Pair 9: (7, 11) -> Both 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 12) -> Both 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (11, 12) -> Both 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Both 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Skipped because 4 is smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are <3, 7, 9> and <0, 5, 6>.

So, the final answer is [2].
