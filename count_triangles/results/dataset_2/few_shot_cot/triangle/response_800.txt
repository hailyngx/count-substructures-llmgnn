Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair including Node 0, as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair containing Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair including Node 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair including Node 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12.
    * Pair 5: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6 to 14:
    * Skipped for not having pairs greater than their respective node numbers.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
