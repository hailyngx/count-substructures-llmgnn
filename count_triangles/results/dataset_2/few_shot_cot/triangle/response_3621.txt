Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - <6, 2, 7> (6 and 2 are connected, 2 and 7 are connected, but 6 and 7 are not connected)
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:**
    - <9, 2, 1> (9 and 2 are connected, 2 and 1 are connected, but 9 and 1 are not connected)
    - <1, 3, 7> (1 and 3 are connected, 3 and 7 are connected, but 1 and 7 are not connected)
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. **Node 2:**
    - <9, 4, 2> (9 and 4 are connected, 4 and 2 are connected, but 9 and 2 are not connected)
    - <1, 2, 7> (1 and 2 are connected, 2 and 7 are connected, but 1 and 7 are not connected)
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. **Node 3:**
    - <6, 5, 3> (6 and 5 are connected, 5 and 3 are connected, but 6 and 3 are not connected)
    - <1, 3, 4> (1 and 3 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, but 1 and 4 are not connected)
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. **Node 4:**
    - <9, 4, 3> (9 and 4 are connected, 4 and 3 are connected, but 9 and 3 are not connected)
    - <1, 4, 5> (1 and 4 are connected, 4 and 5 are connected, but 1 and 5 are not connected)
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. **Node 5:**
    - <6, 5, 3> (6 and 5 are connected, 5 and 3 are connected, but 6 and 3 are not connected)
    - <1, 5, 4> (1 and 5 are connected, 5 and 4 are connected, but 1 and 4 are not connected)
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

7. **Node 6:**
    - <9, 6, 5> (9 and 6 are connected, 6 and 5 are connected, but 9 and 5 are not connected)
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. **Node 7:**
    - <1, 7, 3> (1 and 7 are connected, 7 and 3 are connected, but 1 and 3 are not connected)
    - <2, 7, 8> (2 and 7 are connected, 7 and 8 are connected, but 2 and 8 are not connected)
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Total number of triangles in the graph: [13]
Unique triangles found: <6, 2, 7>, <9, 2, 1>, <1, 3, 7>, <9, 4, 2>, <1, 2, 7>, <6, 5, 3>, <1, 3, 4>, <9, 4, 3>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 4>, <9, 6, 5>, <1, 7, 3>, <2, 7, 8>.
