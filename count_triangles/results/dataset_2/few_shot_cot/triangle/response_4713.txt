Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 6) -> 17 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 9) -> 17 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (16, 9) -> 16 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
