Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <0, 4, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> No edge between nodes 0 and 7, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 1, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <2, 5, 8>
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> No edge between nodes 3 and 10, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No edge between nodes 2 and 7, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10: <3, 4, 10>
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <3, 13, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <0, 4, 6>
    * Pair 2: (13, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <3, 13, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (12, 5) -> No edge between nodes 12 and 5, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <2, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <0, 4, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No edge between nodes 1 and 7, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <2, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No edge between nodes 4 and 9, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <3, 4, 10>
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12: <11, 12, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <3, 13, 4>
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <3, 13, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 1, 13>
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <3, 13, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12: <11, 12, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 2 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 16.

Therefore, there are [16] triangles in the given graph.
