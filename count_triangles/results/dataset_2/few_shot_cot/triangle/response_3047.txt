Response:
Let's go step-by-step through each node to find the number of triangles in the graph:

Node 0:
* Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Connected to both nodes (3, 15) and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
* Pair 2: (3, 10) -> Both nodes are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not directly connected. No triangle.
* Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Connected to both nodes (3, 8) and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
