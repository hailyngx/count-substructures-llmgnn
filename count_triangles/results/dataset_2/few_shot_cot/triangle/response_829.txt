Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 4>.
            * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 5>.
            * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and connected. Triangle formed <0, 2, 5>.
            * Pair 4: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 7: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors, and connected. Triangle formed <0, 4, 1>.
            * Pair 8: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 1>).

        * Node 1:
            * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
            * No valid pairs to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
            * No valid pairs to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors, and connected. Triangle formed <3, 4, 0>.
            * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors, and connected. Triangle formed <3, 11, 2>.
            * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors, and connected. Triangle formed <0, 3, 4>.
            * Pair 5: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors, and connected. Triangle formed <3, 12, 5>.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (<3, 4, 0>, <3, 11, 2>, <3, 12, 5>).

        * Node 4:
            * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
            * No valid pairs to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
            * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors, and connected. Triangle formed <5, 12, 4>.
            * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<5, 12, 4>).

        * Node 6 - Node 14:
            * Skipped as there are not enough nodes greater than 6 to form valid triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

        Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 
        
        The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 1>, <3, 4, 0>, <3, 11, 2>, <3, 12, 5>, <5, 12, 4>.

        Hence, the final answer is [7].
