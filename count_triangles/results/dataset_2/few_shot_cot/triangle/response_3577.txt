Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Both 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Both 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> Both 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
