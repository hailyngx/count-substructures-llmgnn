Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are all greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are all greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are all greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are all greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are all greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * There are no other nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * There are no other nodes greater than 6 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are all greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are all greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are all greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14 as they are all greater than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 12, 13, and 14 as they are all greater than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 13 and 14 as they are both greater than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 14 as it is greater than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * There are no other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
