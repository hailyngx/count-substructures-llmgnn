Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 2) -> Not an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Connected through edge (5, 9). Continue to the third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 18) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 19) -> Connected through edge (5, 1). Continue to the third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 18) -> Connected through edge (9, 19). Continue to the third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (9, 19) -> Connected through edge (9, 1). Continue to the third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 7: (1, 18) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (1, 19) -> Connected through edge (1, 5). Continue to the third node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4
    * Unique triangles: <1, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 19>, <1, 9, 18>, <1, 9, 19>

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> Connected through edge (11, 15). Continue to the third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 19) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 17) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 12) -> Connected through edge (3, 11). Continue to the third node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles: <3, 11, 15>, <3, 11, 19>

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Connected through edge (9, 19). Continue to the third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 17) -> Connected through edge (9, 4). Continue to the third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 17) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles: <4, 9, 19>, <4, 9, 17>

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 9, and 12 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> Connected through edge (4, 17). Continue to the third node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles: 1
    * Unique triangle: <4, 10, 15>

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 17:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 10) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
