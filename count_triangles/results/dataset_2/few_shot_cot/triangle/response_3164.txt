Response:
Following the step-by-step process as demonstrated in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 19>
    * Pair 2: (5, 15) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 15>
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (19, 15) -> Triangle formed: <0, 19, 15>
    * Pair 5: (19, 13) -> Triangle formed: <0, 19, 13>
    * Pair 6: (15, 13) -> Triangle formed: <0, 15, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 8>
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> Triangle formed: <2, 8, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Following these steps for the remaining nodes:

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles: 1

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles: 2

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles: 1

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles: 1

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles: 3

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles: 3

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 17:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles: 0

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 3 (Node 14) + 3 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 17

Therefore, there are [17] triangles in the given graph.
