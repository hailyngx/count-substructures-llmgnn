Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's find the total number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 4) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0).
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (6, 2) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1).
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    - These nodes do not have at least 2 larger nodes to form a triangle with, therefore no triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
