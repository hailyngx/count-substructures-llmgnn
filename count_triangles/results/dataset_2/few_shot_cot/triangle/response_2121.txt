Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Both 9 and 11 are connected to node 0, and they are also directly connected to each other as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are connected to node 1, and they are also directly connected to each other as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are connected to node 1, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Both 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are connected to node 4, and they are also directly connected to each other as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Both 11 and 13 are connected to node 6, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Both 9 and 11 are connected to node 7, and they are also directly connected to each other as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> Both 11 and 12 are connected to node 8, and they are also directly connected to each other as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are connected to node 9, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> Both 11 and 12 are connected to node 9, and they are also directly connected to each other as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Both 9 and 12 are connected to node 10, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Both 9 and 12 are connected to node 11, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes to form triangles with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are connected to node 13, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes to form triangles with Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
