Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 12 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 3, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 12) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

The process should be continued for the remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's calculate the final answer.
