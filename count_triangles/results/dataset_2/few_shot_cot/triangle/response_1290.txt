Response:
Following the detailed steps outlined in the example provided with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2, Node 4, and Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2, Node 3, and Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2, Node 4, and Node 5.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2, Node 3, and Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3, Node 6, and Node 9.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3, Node 5, and Node 6.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3, Node 6, and Node 9.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3, Node 5, and Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4, Node 7, and Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4, Node 8, and Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4, Node 9, and Node 3.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4, Node 5, and Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6, Node 7, and Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6, Node 9, and Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6, Node 5, and Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2,  and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7, Node 6, and Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7, Node 5, and Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [18].
