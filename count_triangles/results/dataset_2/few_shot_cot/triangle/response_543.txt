Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, and node 7

Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph with the given information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * No more pairs to consider. No additional triangles can be formed.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs where nodes 8 and 9 participate to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
