Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, we will now determine the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node in the graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 13) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 15) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (9, 17) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (0, 10) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 18) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (15, 16) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles found with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles found with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No triangles found with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

Since there are no more nodes to analyze for triangles, we can conclude the calculation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
