Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14: Skipped because there are no nodes greater than them in the list to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) = 12.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
