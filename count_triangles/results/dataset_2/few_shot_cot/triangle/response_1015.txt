Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Both 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 13 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> Both 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 9) -> Both 13 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 2) -> 13 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Already counted as a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> Already counted as a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 13) -> Already counted as a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 5: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Already counted as a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> Already counted as a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Already counted as a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> Already counted as a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 12.

* Node 13:
    * Already covered in triangle counting for Nodes 1, 5, and 6.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 14.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
