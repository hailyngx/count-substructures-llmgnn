Response:
Following the example step-by-step process, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5: 
    No triangles can be formed with these nodes.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there is not at least 2 nodes greater than this node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Similar steps are followed for Nodes 8, 9, and 10.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and 4 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as there is not at least 2 nodes greater than this node.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and 5 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as there is not at least 2 nodes greater than this node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
