Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (21, 25) -> 21 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 21 and 25 are also connected as (21, 25) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (21, 6) -> 21 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 21 and 6 are also connected as (21, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (25, 6) -> 25 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 22) -> 2 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 22 are not connected directly in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 29) -> 2 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 29 are not connected directly in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 10 are not connected directly in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (25, 13) -> 25 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 25 and 13 are connected as (25, 2, 13) in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (21, 16) -> 21 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Continuing this process for the rest of the nodes to count the triangles.
