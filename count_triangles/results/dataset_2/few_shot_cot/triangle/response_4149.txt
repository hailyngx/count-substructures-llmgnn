Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 27) -> 14 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 27 are directly connected as (14, 27) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 3) -> 14 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (27, 3) -> 27 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
