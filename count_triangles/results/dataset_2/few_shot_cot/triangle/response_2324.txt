Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Skip as both are smaller than 0.
            * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Skip as both are smaller than 0.
            * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Skip as both are smaller than 0.
            * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 7: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 8: (9, 2) -> Skip as both are smaller than 0.
            * Pair 9: (9, 7) -> Skip as both are smaller than 0.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Since all 1-hop neighbors of 1 are smaller than 1, no triangle can be formed with 1 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Skip as both are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> Skip as both are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 6: (9, 6) -> Skip as both are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 7: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Skip as both are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
            * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

        Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
