Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not connected because (9, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> Both 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 1 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> Both 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> 7 is 1-hop neighbor of 2 and 3 is another 1-hop neighbor of 2 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9: No triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node because they all have smaller numbered neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph [6] because the sum of triangles found for each node is 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 7.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
