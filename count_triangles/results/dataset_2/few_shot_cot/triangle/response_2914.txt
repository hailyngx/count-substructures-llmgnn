Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph based on the adjacency list and edge list:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs possible with nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs possible with nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 10 - No triangles can be formed with nodes greater than them.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 11) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 - No triangles can be formed with nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
