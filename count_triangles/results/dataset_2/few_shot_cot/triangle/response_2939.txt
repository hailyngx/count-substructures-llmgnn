Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are directly connected, but not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * There are no triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * There are no triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * There are no triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Already counted in Node 0's triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * There are no other triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * There are no triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * There are no triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * There are no triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * There are no triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * There are no triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * There are no triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * There are no triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * There are no triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * There are no triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * There are no triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * There are no triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * There are no triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
