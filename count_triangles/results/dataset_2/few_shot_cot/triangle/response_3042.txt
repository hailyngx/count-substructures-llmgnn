Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same step-by-step process:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors. Now, let's check if there is a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of both 0 and 7:
        * There is no such node. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors. Now, let's check if there is a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of both 0 and 3:
        * The third node is 7. Hence, the triangle is formed: <0, 3, 7>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors. Now, let's check if there is a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of both 1 and 4:
        * There is no such node. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors. Now, let's check if there is a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of both 1 and 3:
        * The third node is 9. Hence, the triangle is formed: <1, 3, 9>

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or nodes less than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors. Now, let's check if there is a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of both 2 and 4:
        * There is no such node. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors. Now, let's check if there is a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of both 2 and 8:
        * There is no such node. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors. Now, let's check if there is a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of both 2 and 6:
        * There is no such node. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors. Now, let's check if there is a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of both 2 and 9:
        * There is no such node. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Continue this process to find all triangles in the graph.

Follow this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 to find all triangles.

Finally, count the total number of triangles in the graph and list them inside brackets [] with unique triangles shown inside <> such as <0, 3, 7>.
