Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * No other possible triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * No other possible triangles.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangle with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * No other possible triangles.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangle with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * No other possible triangles.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangle with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangle with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangle with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangle with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangle with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangle with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing, there are no triangles found in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
