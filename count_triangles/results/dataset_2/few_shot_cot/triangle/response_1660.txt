Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, we will determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

* Node 1:
    * <1, 17, 8> - 1, 17, and 8 form a triangle as they are all connected to each other.
    * <1, 9, 19> - 1, 9, and 19 form a triangle as they are all connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * <2, 1, 17> - 2, 1, and 17 form a triangle as they are all connected to each other.
    * No other possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

* Node 4:
    * <4, 12, 14> - 4, 12, and 14 form a triangle as they are all connected to each other.
    * No other possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

* Node 8:
    * <8, 1, 17> - 8, 1, and 17 form a triangle as they are all connected to each other.
    * No other possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

* Node 10:
    * <10, 9, 14> - 10, 9, and 14 form a triangle as they are all connected to each other.
    * No other possible triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles as there are no connected triplets.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 10) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
