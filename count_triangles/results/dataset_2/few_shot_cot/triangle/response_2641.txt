Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Checking common neighbors, node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 8. There are no common neighbors between 4 and 5 that are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Checking common neighbors, node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 8. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 0. There are no common neighbors between 5 and 2 that are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Checking common neighbors, node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 0. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 6. There are no common neighbors between 4 and 7 that are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Checking common neighbors, node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 1. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 3. There are no common neighbors between 7 and 8 that are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Checking common neighbors, node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 6. The only common neighbor between 5 and 7 is node 6 which is directly connected to both, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (for the triangle <5, 6, 7>)

I will continue this process for the remaining nodes to find all the triangles in the graph.
