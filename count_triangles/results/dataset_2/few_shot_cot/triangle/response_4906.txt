Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (24, 28) -> 24 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 24 and 28 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 24) -> 5 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 20) -> 8 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 8 and 20 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 20) -> 12 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 12 and 20 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 27) -> 15 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 15 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (15, 12) -> 15 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 15 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (27, 12) -> 27 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 27 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (21, 25) -> 21 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 21 and 25 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 24) -> 9 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 24) -> 1 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Keep repeating this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9, and finally, sum up the total number of triangles.
