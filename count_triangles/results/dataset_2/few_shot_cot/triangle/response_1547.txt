Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 10 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 10 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 8 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as all nodes smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as all nodes smaller than 5.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as all nodes smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 0 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 7 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 5 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and 1 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to consider as all nodes smaller than 13.

* Node 14:
    * No pairs to consider as all nodes smaller than 14.
    
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
