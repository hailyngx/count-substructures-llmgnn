Response:
Following the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 0) and (4, 14) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 11 are also connected as (4, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 11 are also connected as (9, 11) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 13: <6, 7, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Node 9 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 12: <9, 2, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Node 11 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 13: <11, 1, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 as they are smaller than 13.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * No triangles formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
