Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are connected as (14, 19) is in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 4: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are connected as (13, 14) is in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are connected as (1, 14) is in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 4: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    * Skip as all possible pairs include nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 4. No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 5. No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are connected as shown in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are connected as shown in the edge list. Potential triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

9. Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 8. No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skip all nodes with no triangles found with at least two greater nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are:
<13, 14, 3>
<1, 14, 19>
<11, 5, 7>
<6, 10, 16>
<10, 7, 17>
