Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined earlier for counting triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. 
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. 
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
