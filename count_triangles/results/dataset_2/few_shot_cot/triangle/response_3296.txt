Response:
Following the same process used in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> Form a triangle with Node 2
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Skip because 2 is smaller than 0
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 10
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 7
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
