Response:
Following the same process as the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (8, 12) - Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (8, 13) - Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (12, 13) - Both 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 9.

        Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
