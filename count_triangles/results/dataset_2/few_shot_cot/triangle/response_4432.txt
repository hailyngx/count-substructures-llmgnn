Response:
Following the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are directly connected (0 is also connected to both 16 and 19).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as it connects to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as it connects to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as it connects to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (0, 19) -> 0, and 19 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as it connects to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as it connects to smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as it connects to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
