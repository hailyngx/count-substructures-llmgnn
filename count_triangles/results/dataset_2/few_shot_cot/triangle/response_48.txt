Response:
Following the process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The pairs with Nodes smaller than 3 are skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, 6, and 7:
    * Follow the same process as above to count triangles with 5, 6, and 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 to Node 19:
    * Continue counting triangles for each of these nodes using the given process.

After following this procedure for all nodes, the total number of triangles in the graph will be inside brackets [].
