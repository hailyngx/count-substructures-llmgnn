Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 12, 13>.

- Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 4, 13>.
  * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 7: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 8: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 9: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 10: (12, 14) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 5, 7>.
  * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 5, 13>.
  * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (12, 13) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 10, 11>.
  * Pair 2: (10, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 10, 14>.
  * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 9, 11>.
  * Pair 4: (9, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 9, 13>.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

- Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

- Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.

- Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
  * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
