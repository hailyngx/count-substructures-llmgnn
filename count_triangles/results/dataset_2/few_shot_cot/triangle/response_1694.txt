Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step applied to each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> form a triangle with Node 0.
            * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> form a triangle with Node 0.
            * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> do not form a triangle with Node 0.
            * Pair 4: (14, 12) -> do not form a triangle with Node 0.
            * Pair 5: (14, 8) -> do not form a triangle with Node 0.
            * Pair 6: (12, 8) -> do not form a triangle with Node 0.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> form a triangle with Node 1.
            * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> do not form a triangle with Node 1.
            * Pair 3: (3, 14) -> do not form a triangle with Node 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> form a triangle with Node 2.
            * Pair 2: (4, 15) -> do not form a triangle with Node 2.
            * Pair 3: (10, 15) -> do not form a triangle with Node 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> form a triangle with Node 3.
            * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> do not form a triangle with Node 3.
            * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> do not form a triangle with Node 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller.
            * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> form a triangle with Node 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller.
            * Pair 1: (17, 10) -> do not form a triangle with Node 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18:
            * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 5.

        Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

        The unique triangles found are:
        <4, 0, 12>
        <4, 0, 14>
        <11, 6, 15>
        <3, 7, 9>
        <2, 4, 10>

        So, the final answer is [5].
