Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 18) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (22, 29) -> Both 22 and 29 are connected as nodes, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Both 11 and 13 are connected as nodes, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Both 4 and 13 are connected as nodes, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> Both 4 and 15 are connected as nodes, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Already counted when considering Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (4, 28) -> Both 4 and 28 are connected as nodes, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are connected as nodes, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are connected as nodes, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 23) -> Both 5 and 23 are connected as nodes, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 21) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 5) -> Already counted when considering Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (7, 21) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 0) -> Already counted when considering Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> Both 17 and 19 are connected as nodes, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28:
    * For nodes without at least 2 other nodes of higher number to form triangles, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 29:
    * Pair 1: (11, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (29, 25) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Remaining nodes) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles: <1, 22, 29>, <3, 4, 13>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 23>.
