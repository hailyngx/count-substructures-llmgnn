Response:
Following the process explained in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) - Both 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 17) - Both 12 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 17) - Both 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 2) - Both 12 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) - Both 12 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 19) - Both 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) - Both 13 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 18) - Both 13 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 16) - Both 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 to find the total number of triangles in the graph.

[The total number of triangles in the given graph is 3, which involve the nodes: <0, 12, 14>, <0, 14, 17>, and <12, 14, 17>.]
