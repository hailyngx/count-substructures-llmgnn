Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (0, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (0, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (0, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip as Node 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are smaller.
    * No more triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip as Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are smaller.
    * No more triangles can be formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip as Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are smaller.
    * No more triangles can be formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip as Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are smaller.
    * No more triangles can be formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip as Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are smaller.
    * No more triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
