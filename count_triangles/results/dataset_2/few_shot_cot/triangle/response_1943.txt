Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

1. Node 0:
    - <5, 6, 0> forms a triangle because all three nodes are directly connected to each other.
    - <5, 14, 0> forms a triangle because all three nodes are directly connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - No valid triangle can be formed involving Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - <7, 2, 4> forms a triangle because all three nodes are directly connected to each other.
    - <10, 13, 2> forms a triangle because all three nodes are directly connected to each other.
    - <12, 1, 2> forms a triangle because all three nodes are directly connected to each other.
    - <12, 2, 3> forms a triangle because all three nodes are directly connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

4. Node 3:
    - No valid triangle can be formed involving Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - <9, 7, 4> forms a triangle because all three nodes are directly connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    - <12, 5, 11> forms a triangle because all three nodes are directly connected to each other.
    - <12, 5, 3> forms a triangle because all three nodes are directly connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

7. Node 6:
    - No valid triangle can be formed involving Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - <9, 7, 4> forms a triangle because all three nodes are directly connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - No valid triangle can be formed involving Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - No valid triangle can be formed involving Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Node 10:
    - No valid triangle can be formed involving Node 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 11:
    - No valid triangle can be formed involving Node 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. Node 12:
    - No valid triangle can be formed involving Node 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 13:
    - No valid triangle can be formed involving Node 13.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. Node 14:
    - No valid triangle can be formed involving Node 14.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Adding up the total triangles from each node:
2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 10

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
