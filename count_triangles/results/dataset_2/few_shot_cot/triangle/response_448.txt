Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected to each other as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected to each other as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected to each other as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected to each other as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected to each other as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected to each other as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected to each other as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pairs to be considered are [(3, 5), (3, 8), (5, 8)]. All of them involve nodes smaller than 1, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs to be considered are [(7, 6), (7, 0), (7, 9), (6, 0), (6, 9), (0, 9)]. All of them involve nodes smaller than 2, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs to be considered are [(7, 9)]. Both nodes are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pairs to be considered are [(8, 9), (8, 5), (9, 5)]. All of them involve nodes smaller than 4, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pairs to be considered are [(4, 7), (4, 1), (7, 1), (7, 6), (1, 6)]. All of them involve nodes smaller than 5, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pairs to be considered are [(7, 0), (7, 5), (0, 5)]. All of them involve nodes smaller than 6, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pairs to be considered are [(0, 9), (3, 9), (9, 8)]. All of them involve nodes smaller than 7, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pairs to be considered are [(4, 9), (4, 5), (9, 5)]. All of them involve nodes smaller than 8, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pairs to be considered are [(4, 5)]. Both nodes are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
