Response:
Following the provided example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 1). One side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 4: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 13). Another side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 10). One side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0 or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are connected as (8, 11). One side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (8, 12). Another side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
