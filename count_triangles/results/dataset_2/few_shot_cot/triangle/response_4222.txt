Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 6>.
            * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 6, 7>.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed <1, 5, 8>.
            * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed <1, 6, 8>.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed <2, 5, 8>.
            * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed <2, 6, 8>.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed <3, 4, 9>.
            * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed <3, 4, 7>.
            * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed <3, 7, 8>.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 4 and Node 5:
            * Skipped because there is no pair of nodes greater than 4 or 5 left to form triangles.

        Summing up the triangles found for each node:

        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

        Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
