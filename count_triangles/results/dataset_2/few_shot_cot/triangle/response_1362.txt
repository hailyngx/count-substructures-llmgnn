Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 0.

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 1.

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    - <2, 3, 7> forms a triangle as they are all connected to each other.

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 3.

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 4.

* Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    - <5, 8, 4> forms a triangle as they are all connected to each other.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 6.

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 7.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 8.

* Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    - <9, 13, 14> forms a triangle as they are all connected to each other.

* Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 10.
  
* Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 11.

* Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 12.

* Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 13.

* Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
