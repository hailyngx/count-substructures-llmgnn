Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Connected. Triangle [1, 2, 4] formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Connected. Triangle [1, 2, 7] formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Connected. Triangle [2, 3, 4] formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Connected. Triangle [2, 3, 7] formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Connected. Triangle [3, 4, 9] formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
