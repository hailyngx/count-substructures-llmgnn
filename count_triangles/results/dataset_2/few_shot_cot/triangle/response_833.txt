Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Directly connected, as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Directly connected, as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Directly connected, forming a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Directly connected, as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Directly connected, forming a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (13, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Directly connected, forming a triangle <4, 10, 11>.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 5.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Directly connected, forming a triangle <7, 8, 12>.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 10.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. Node 11:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. Node 12:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    - Pair 1: (3, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 13:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11 as they are smaller than 13.
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Directly connected, forming a triangle <13, 5, 14>.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

15. Node 14:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    - Pair 1: (3, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 13) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

[<0, 1, 4>, <4, 10, 11>, <7, 8, 12>, <5, 13, 14>, <1, 4, 7>]
