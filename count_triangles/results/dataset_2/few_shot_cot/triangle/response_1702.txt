Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) - Both 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) - Both 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 11) - Both 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) - Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 6: 1 triangle
* Node 7: 1 triangle
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 1 triangle
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 1 triangle
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles for each node and totaling them up, we get:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 16

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 1, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 12>, <2, 7, 12>, <3, 5, 12>, <3, 12, 13>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 11>, <4, 8, 11>, <4, 9, 11>, <4, 9, 7>, <5, 12, 14>, <6, 7, 2>, <9, 1, 10>, <12, 13, 14>]
