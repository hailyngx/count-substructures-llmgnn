Response:
Following the example provided, we will now count the triangles in the given graph by examining each node and the possible triangles involving that node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 since it has only one connection.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed: <5, 7, 18>
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed: <6, 9, 18>
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 12) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed: <7, 8, 13>
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed: <6, 9, 11>
    * Pair 2: (11, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 since it has fewer than 2 unconnected connected neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (16, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 since it has fewer than 2 unconnected connected neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (19, 14) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 since it has fewer than 2 unconnected connected neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 since it has fewer than 2 unconnected connected neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 since it has fewer than 2 unconnected connected neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
