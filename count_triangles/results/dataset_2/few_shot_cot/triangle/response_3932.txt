Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 0 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.

    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
