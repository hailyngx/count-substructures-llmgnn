Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) = 25

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [25].
