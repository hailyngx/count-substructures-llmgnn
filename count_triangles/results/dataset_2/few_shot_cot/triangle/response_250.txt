Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected and form a triangle with node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are directly connected and form a triangle with node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are directly connected and form a triangle with node 7.
    * No other triangles can be formed by Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are directly connected and form a triangle with node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
