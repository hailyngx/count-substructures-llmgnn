Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: <0, 11, 17> - Node 0 is connected to nodes 11 and 17. Nodes 11 and 17 are not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: <1, 9, 13> - Nodes 1, 9, and 13 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes... No triangle can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: <3, 13, 14> - Nodes 3, 13, and 14 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: <4, 8, 16> - Nodes 4, 8, and 16 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: <5, 12, 16> - Nodes 5, 12, and 16 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: <6, 11, 18> - Nodes 6, 11, and 18 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: <7, 9, 13> - Nodes 7, 9, and 13 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: <4, 8, 16> - Nodes 4, 8, and 16 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: <1, 7, 9> - Nodes 1, 7, and 9 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, 12, 15, 17:
    * Skipping these nodes as they don't have at least two greater numbered nodes to form a triangle.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: <3, 13, 14> - Nodes 3, 13, and 14 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: <7, 9, 13> - Nodes 7, 9, and 13 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: <3, 13, 14> - Nodes 3, 13, and 14 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: <4, 8, 16> - Nodes 4, 8, and 16 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: <5, 7, 16> - Nodes 5, 7, and 16 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: <6, 11, 18> - Nodes 6, 11, and 18 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: <18, 19, 6> - Nodes 18, 19, and 6 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Pair 2: <14, 19, 18> - Nodes 14, 19, and 18 are connected forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 13) + 4 (Node 16) + 2 (Node 18) + 2 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14) = 14.

Therefore, there are [14] triangles in the given graph.
