Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 20) -> 7 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 20) -> 14 and 20 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 22) -> 7 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Nodes 27, 28, 29: Skipped as they are smaller than Node 30, and they don't have at least 2 larger neighbors to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
