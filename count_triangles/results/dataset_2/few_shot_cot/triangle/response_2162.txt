Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, and 6 and 7 are also connected through node 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are connected, and 1 and 8 are also connected through node 7. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are connected, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are connected, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are connected, and 2 and 11 are also connected through node 12. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are connected, and 3 and 12 are also connected through node 14. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are connected, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are connected, and 5 and 12 are also connected through node 11. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped all because there isn't at least one node greater than each.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
