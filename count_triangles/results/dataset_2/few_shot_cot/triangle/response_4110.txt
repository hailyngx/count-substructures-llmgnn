Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 3

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - Directly connected, forming a triangle <1, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Directly connected, forming a triangle <4, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes. No pair left to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - Directly connected, forming a triangle <6, 1, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) - Directly connected, forming a triangle <7, 1, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Directly connected, forming a triangle <4, 7, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) - Directly connected, forming a triangle <5, 1, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
