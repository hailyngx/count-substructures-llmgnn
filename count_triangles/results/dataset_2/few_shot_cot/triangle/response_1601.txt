Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (15, 28) -> 15 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (18, 28) -> 18 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (7, 29) -> 7 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - No possible triangles as there are no 3 nodes greater than 3.

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 28) -> 6 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (16, 28) -> 16 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
