Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs of nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 6: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (14, 8) -> 14 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs of nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs of nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.

    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs of nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest node.

Now, continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, and then calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.
