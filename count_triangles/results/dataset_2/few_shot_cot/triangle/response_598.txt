Response:
Following the same process as described in the example above for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors. 
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 21.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [21].
