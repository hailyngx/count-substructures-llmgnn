Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for each node to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Number of triangles found: 0

* Node 1:
    - Number of triangles found: 0

* Node 2:
    - Number of triangles found: 0

* Node 3:
    - Number of triangles found: 0

* Node 4:
    - Number of triangles found: 0

* Node 5:
    - Number of triangles found: 0

* Node 6:
    - Number of triangles found: 0

* Node 7:
    - Number of triangles found: 0

* Node 8:
    - Number of triangles found: 0

* Node 9:
    - Number of triangles found: 12
    - Unique triangles:
        - <1, 9, 7>
        - <1, 9, 4>
        - <1, 9, 6>
        - <1, 9, 5>
        - <2, 9, 7>
        - <2, 9, 4>
        - <2, 9, 6>
        - <2, 9, 1>
        - <3, 9, 7>
        - <3, 9, 2>
        - <3, 9, 1>
        - <4, 9, 7>

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 12 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
