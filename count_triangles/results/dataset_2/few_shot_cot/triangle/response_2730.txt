Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected through node 1. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected through node 0. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are connected through node 0. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are connected through node 0. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected through node 0. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected through node 1. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected through node 1. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are connected through node 1. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected through node 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected through node 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are connected through node 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are connected through node 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are connected through node 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected through node 3. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are connected through node 3. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are connected through node 3. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected through node 7. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
