Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the previous example, here is the breakdown of counting triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are directly connected as (5, 2) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are directly connected as (9, 1) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are directly connected as (9, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are directly connected as (9, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are directly connected as (1, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 1 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 2 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 3 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are directly connected as (8, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are directly connected as (8, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are directly connected as (8, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 1 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are directly connected as (1, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are directly connected as (8, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 1 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
