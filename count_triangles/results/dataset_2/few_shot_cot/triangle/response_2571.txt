Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
        
The answer is [10].
