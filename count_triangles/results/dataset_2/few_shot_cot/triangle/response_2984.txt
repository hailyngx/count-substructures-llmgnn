Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (22, 12) -> 22 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 8) -> 22 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 8) -> 12 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. No other triangles with Node 0 exist.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (26, 2) -> 26 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. No other triangles with Node 1 exist.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. No other triangles with Node 2 exist.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (16, 15) -> 16 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. No other triangles with Node 3 exist.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (26, 5) -> 26 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. No other triangles with Node 4 exist.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 25) -> 13 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. No other triangles with Node 5 exist.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. No other triangles with Node 6 exist.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 29) -> 15 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. No other triangles with Node 7 exist.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. No other triangles with Node 8 exist.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (16, 9) -> 16 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. No other triangles with Node 9 exist.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (17, 26) -> 17 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected. No other triangles with Node 10 exist.

* Node 11 to Node 29:
    * Skipped as there are not enough nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
