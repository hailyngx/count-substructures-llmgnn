Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 22) -> 5 and 22 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2: 
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 23) -> 7 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (21, 23) -> 21 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 22) -> 9 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 22) -> 17 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (22, 23) -> 22 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * Skipping calculations as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

* Node 20:
    * Pair 1: (26, 28) -> 26 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 20, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (26, 22) -> 26 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 20, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (28, 22) -> 28 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 20, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 21 to 29:
    * Skipping calculations as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 3 (Node 20) = 11.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
