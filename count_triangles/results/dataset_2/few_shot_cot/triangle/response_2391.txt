Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 12) -> 16 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 to find the total number of triangles in the graph.

Once you have checked all nodes, sum up the total number of triangles formed by each node as the smallest numbered node.

Then, provide the unique triangles found within brackets [].
