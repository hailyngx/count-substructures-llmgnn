Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 0, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Nodes 1 and 2 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Nodes 4 and 5 are connected, and they have a common neighbor, Node 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Nodes 0 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are connected, but they do not have a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
