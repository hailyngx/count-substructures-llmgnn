Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are connected, no triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3 as the third vertex.
    - Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 11 as the third vertex.
    - Pair 4: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3 as the third vertex.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected, no triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 11 as the third vertex.
    - Pair 3: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are connected, no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 13 as the third vertex.
    - Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are connected, no triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected, no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 7 as the third vertex.
    - Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 11 as the third vertex.
    - Pair 3: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0 as the third vertex.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are connected, no triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are connected, no triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 7 as the third vertex.
    - Pair 4: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3 as the third vertex.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5.

Proceed similarly for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 following the same process outlined above.

After calculating the total number of triangles each node can form and summing them up, the final answer will be provided as requested.
