Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are connected through (6, 5) edge. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected through (6, 7) edge. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected through (5, 7) edge. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected through (9, 1) and (7, 1) edges. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes with smaller numbers.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are connected through (8, 4) edge. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected through (8, 3) and (3, 13) edges. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are connected through (8, 2) and (2, 11) edges. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are connected through (4, 13) edge. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are connected through (4, 11) edge. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are connected through (13, 11) edge. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, 14:
    - All pairs involving these nodes have at least two other nodes with smaller numbers. Hence, no triangles can be formed with these as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
