Response:
Following the step-by-step procedure outlined in the initial example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 20) -> No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (2, 22) -> No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (2, 5) -> No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 19) -> No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (15, 20) -> No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> Form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 26:
    * Pair 1: (26, 28) -> No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (16, 26) -> Form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (20, 26) -> No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (21, 26) -> Form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 27, 28, and 29:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
