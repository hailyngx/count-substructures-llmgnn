Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph described:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * No possible triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Nodes 7-19) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
