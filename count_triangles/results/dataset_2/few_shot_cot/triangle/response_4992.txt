Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, we will count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) - 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) - 9 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 2) - 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 2) - 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) - 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) - 7 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 6) - 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 2) - 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 2) - 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) - 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 3) - 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) - 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) - 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 0) - 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 0) - 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) - 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) - 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 2) - 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 2) - 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
