Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) - 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 1) - 12 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, and 1 is also a 1-hop neighbor of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 1) - 18 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, and 1 is also a 1-hop neighbor of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 since it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (0, 19) - 0 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, and 19 is also a 1-hop neighbor of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) - 17 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 19) - 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, and 19 is also a 1-hop neighbor of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 19) - 7 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (17, 9) - 17 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 10. 
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 12.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 13. 
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 14. 
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 15. 
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 16. 
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 17. 
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 18.

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 19. 
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
