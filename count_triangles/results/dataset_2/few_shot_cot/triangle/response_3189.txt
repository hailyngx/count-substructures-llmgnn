Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed (0, 4, 5).
    <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed (0, 5, 8).
    <0, 5, 8>

    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed (1, 5, 9).
    <1, 5, 9>
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed (1, 5, 8).
    <1, 5, 8>
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed (1, 9, 5).
    <1, 9, 5>
    * Pair 4: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed (1, 3, 2).
    <1, 3, 2>
    * Pair 5: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed (1, 2, 6).
    <1, 2, 6>
    * Pair 6: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed (1, 8, 2).
    <1, 8, 2>

    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed (2, 4, 7).
    <2, 4, 7>
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed (2, 7, 3).
    <2, 7, 3>

    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed (3, 7, 4).
    <3, 7, 4>
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed (3, 1, 5).
    <3, 1, 5>
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed (3, 2, 7).
    <3, 2, 7>

    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 6 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
