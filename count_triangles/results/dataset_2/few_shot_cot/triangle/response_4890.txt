Response:
Following the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 1>
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 5: (6, 1) -> Triangle formed: <0, 6, 1>
    * Pair 6: (2, 1) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 6: (7, 2) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 7: (7, 3) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 8: (8, 2) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 9: (8, 3) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 10: (2, 3) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed: <4, 7, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> Triangle formed: <5, 6, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Triangle formed: <6, 5, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <7, 4, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
