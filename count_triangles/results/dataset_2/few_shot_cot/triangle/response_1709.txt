Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (0, 29) -> 0 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (3, 27) -> 3 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (3, 29) -> 3 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * No other nodes left to form triangles.

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    Continue this process for Nodes 7, 8, 9, and so on, until you have examined all nodes. Finally, calculate the total number of triangles.

    * Total triangles in the graph = [8].
 
Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
