Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are connected, but they do not have a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are connected, but they do not have a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are connected, but they do not have a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of each other. Checking for the third node:
        * (6, 2) - Forms a triangle with node 2. Triangle <2, 3, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 3, 6>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> Already counted when processing node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are connected, but they do not have a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected, but they do not have a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are connected, but they do not have a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of nodes that are 1-hop neighbors with a direct edge between them.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are connected, but they do not have a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are connected, but they do not have a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are connected, but they do not have a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) -> Already counted when processing node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No new triangles can be formed based on the current nodes processed.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are connected, but they do not have a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No new triangles can be formed based on the current nodes processed.

* Node 16:
    * No new triangles can be formed based on the current nodes processed.

* Node 17:
    * No triangle can be formed based on the current nodes processed.

* Node 18:
    * No new triangles can be formed based on the current nodes processed.

* Node 19:
    * No triangle can be formed based on the current nodes processed.

Summarizing the triangles found as per the given graph:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 0 + 1 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
