Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected (9, 18). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are directly connected, and 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected (12, 13). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 23) -> 11 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 23) -> 2 and 23 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (17, 23) -> 17 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (15, 20) -> 15 and 20 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 24) -> 15 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected (15, 24). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 10) -> 15 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Continue this process for Nodes 5 to 29 following the instructions from the example.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = [Total triangles with Node 0] + [Total triangles with Node 1] + [Total triangles with Node 2] + [Total triangles with Node 3] + [Total triangles with Node 4] + ... + [Total triangles with Node 29].
* Calculate the total number of triangles and list them inside <>.

Please proceed with this step-by-step approach for each node to find the total number of triangles in the graph and provide the final answer inside brackets [].
