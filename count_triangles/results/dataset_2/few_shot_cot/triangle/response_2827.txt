Response:
Following the previous example, we will count the triangles in the provided graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (21, 23) -> 21 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 3 to 29, we will find the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed:
