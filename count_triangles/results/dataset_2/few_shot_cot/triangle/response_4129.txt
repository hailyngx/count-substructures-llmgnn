Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (1, 8) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (3, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Both 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skip all other pairs as they involve smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair involving a smaller node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair involving a smaller node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
