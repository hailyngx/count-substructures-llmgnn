Response:
Following the step-by-step instructions provided in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Since Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes, there are no triangles involving Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Since Node 3 is connected only to Node 0, there are no triangles involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> These nodes are already considered when Node 5 was the smallest. Skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> These nodes are already considered when Node 4 was the smallest. Skipped.
    * Pair 2: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (9, 8) -> These nodes are already considered when Node 8 was the smallest. Skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (16, 10) -> 16 and 10 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (17, 10) -> 17 and 10 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for Nodes 11 to 19, we get:

* Node 11: 2 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 1 triangle
* Node 14: 2 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 1 triangle
* Node 17: 1 triangle
* Node 18: 2 triangles
* Node 19: 2 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 4 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 2 (Node 18) + 2 (Node 19) = 27.

Therefore, there are 27 triangles in the given graph.
