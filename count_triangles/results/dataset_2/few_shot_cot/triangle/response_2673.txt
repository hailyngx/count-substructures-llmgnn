Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <0, 4, 5>
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <1, 3, 9>
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <2, 4, 5>
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 5 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes to form triangles with.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 5, 6>
        * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <4, 5, 9>
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 5, 6>
        * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <2, 5, 7>
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 4 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes to form triangles with.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <4, 5, 9>
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Nodes 8 and 9:
        * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles with.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

    Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
