Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected (2, 0, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 16) -> Both 2 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected (2, 16, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 16) -> Both 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected (6, 16, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected (2, 7, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> Both 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 2) -> Both 13 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected (13, 2, 17) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing in the same way for the rest of the nodes:

* Node 3: 0 triangles
* Node 4: 0 triangles
* Node 5: 0 triangles
* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 2 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 2 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles

Summarizing:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
