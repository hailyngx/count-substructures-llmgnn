Response:
Following the steps outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> Both 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> Both 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (9, 2) -> Both 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (9, 0) -> Both 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (1, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (1, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (4, 2) -> Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.

    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Both 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 2) -> Both 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (9, 0) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (0, 4) -> Both 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (0, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (0, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip as all other nodes are smaller than 4.

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * All skipped as they have fewer than two nodes greater than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
