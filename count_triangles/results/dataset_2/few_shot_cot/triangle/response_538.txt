Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the graph by examining each node as the smallest node in a potential triangle.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> Both 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> Both 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair (0, 7) since 0 is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pair (7, 9) since 7 is smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
