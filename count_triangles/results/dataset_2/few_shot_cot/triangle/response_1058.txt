Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided with the new information given:

1. *Node 0:*
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 2: (3, 10) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 3: (3, 13) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 4: (6, 10) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 5: (6, 13) -> Connected, as (6, 13) is in the edge list.
    - Pair 6: (10, 13) -> Not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles found: <0, 6, 13>

2. *Node 1:*
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Connected, as (4, 7) is in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Connected, as (4, 8) is in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (4, 13) -> Connected, as (4, 13) is in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Connected, as (4, 6) is in the edge list.
    - Pair 5: (7, 8) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 6: (7, 13) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 7: (8, 13) -> Not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4
    - Unique triangles found: <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 4, 6>

3. *Node 2:*
    - Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 2: (3, 11) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 3: (10, 11) -> Not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. *Node 3:*
    - Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Connected, as (7, 10) is in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (7, 13) -> Not connected.
    - Pair 3: (10, 13) -> Not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles found: <3, 7, 10>

5. *Node 4:*
    - Skip all pairs since they involve nodes smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. *Node 5:*
    - Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. *Node 6:*
    - Skip all pairs since they involve nodes smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. *Node 7:*
    - Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. *Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:*
    - Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
*Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.*
*[6 triangles in total]*

Therefore, the output should be:
[<0, 6, 13>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 4, 6>, <3, 7, 10>]
