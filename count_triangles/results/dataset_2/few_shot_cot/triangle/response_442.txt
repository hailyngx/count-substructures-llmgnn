Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 4: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 0) -> 10 and 0 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 4: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 0) -> 11 and 0 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
