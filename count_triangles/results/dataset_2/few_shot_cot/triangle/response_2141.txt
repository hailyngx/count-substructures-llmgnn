Response:
Applying the process described in the previous example to count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 9) -> 15 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
