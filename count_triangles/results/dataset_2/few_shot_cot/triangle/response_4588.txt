Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 1) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (4, 1) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (6, 1) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (7, 1) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 0) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (9, 3) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (9, 4) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - Not a triangle as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with nodes greater than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
