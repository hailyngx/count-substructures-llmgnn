Response:
Following the methodology outlined in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 17) -> Both 10 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 17) -> Both 11 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> Both 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 19) -> Both 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> Both 13 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 9) -> Both 13 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> Both 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 15) -> Both 13 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> Both 6 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 3 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Repeat the same process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 18, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 19, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + ... + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19)
* Total triangles in the graph = 10

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: <4, 6, 15>, <11, 0, 10>, <13, 9, 2>, <13, 15, 3>, <13, 18, 2>, <14, 9, 18>, <17, 0, 3>, <17, 7, 3>, <17, 7, 6>, <2, 18, 13>.

So, the final answer is [10].
