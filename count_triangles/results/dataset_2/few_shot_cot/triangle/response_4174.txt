Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example for counting triangles in the graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 22) -> 3 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 22 are also connected as (3, 22) shown in the edge list.
        * No other pair involving Node 0.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (4, 22) -> 4 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge (4, 22) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (20, 22) -> 20 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (20, 22) shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (1, 25) -> 1 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 25) shown in the edge list.
        * No other pair involving Node 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * No pairs to consider as all nodes connected to Node 2 are smaller than 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 13) shown in the edge list.
        * No other pair involving Node 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * No pairs to consider as all nodes connected to Node 4 are smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * No pairs to consider as all nodes connected to Node 5 are smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (26, 27) -> 26 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (26, 27) shown in the edge list.
        * No other pair involving Node 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * No pairs to consider as all nodes connected to Node 7 are smaller than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (20, 24) -> 20 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (20, 24) shown in the edge list.
        * No other pair involving Node 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (10, 14) shown in the edge list.
        * No other pair involving Node 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Nodes 10 to 29:
        * Skipping these nodes as they are missing 2 or more nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [7].
