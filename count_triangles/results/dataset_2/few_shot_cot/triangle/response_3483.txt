Response:
Following the process outlined in the example for each of the 15 nodes:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 9.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 10.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 11.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 12.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 13.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 14.

Summing up the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 8) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
