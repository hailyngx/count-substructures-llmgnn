Response:
Following the instruction provided in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 2) -> No triangle formed since 13 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (13, 19) -> No triangle formed since 13 and 19 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 19) -> No triangle formed since 2 and 19 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 5) -> No triangle formed since 11 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) -> No triangle formed since 11 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 19) -> No triangle formed since 1 and 19 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> No triangle formed since 11 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skipped as there is no other node greater than 16.

* Node 17:
    * Skipped as there is no other node greater than 17.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> No triangle formed since 9 and 19 are not connected.
