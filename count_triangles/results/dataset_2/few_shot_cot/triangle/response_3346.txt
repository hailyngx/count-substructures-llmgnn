Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) - No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) - No triangle formed as 9 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) - No triangle formed as 6 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) - Triangle formed as 6, 4, and 1 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - Triangle formed as 9, 4, and 2 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) - Triangle formed as 9, 8, and 2 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) - No triangle formed as 9 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Triangle formed as 6, 8, and 4 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5: 
    * No triangles can be formed as it is not connected to any other nodes.

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and 9:
    * Since every combination with 8 and 9 has been explored with other nodes, no more triangles can be formed with them as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4 triangles] in the given graph.
