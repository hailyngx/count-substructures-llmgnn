Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided in the prompt, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Already counted under Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Already counted under Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * The pairs (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8) are already counted under Nodes 2, 0, and 8 respectively.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Already counted under Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Already counted under Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> Already counted under Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> Already counted under Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Already counted under Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pairs (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), and (7, 6) are already counted under Nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6 respectively.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it has only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
