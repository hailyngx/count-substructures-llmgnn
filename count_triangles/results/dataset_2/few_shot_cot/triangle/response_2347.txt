Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example described above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No additional triangles found for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (7, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No additional triangles found for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No additional triangles found for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles found for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No additional triangles found for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No additional triangles found for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles found for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No additional triangles found for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * No additional triangles found for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
