Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 19) -> They are directly connected. No third node connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (15, 19) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (15, 6) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (19, 6) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> They are directly connected. One common neighbor: Node 2. Triangle formed: <2, 16, 18>.
    * Pair 2: (16, 10) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> They are directly connected. No third node connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> They are directly connected. No third node connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (16, 13) -> They are directly connected. One common neighbor: Node 4. Triangle formed: <4, 13, 16>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 2 or numbers lower than 10.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 3.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 2, 10, or numbers lower than 14.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs that can form triangles with nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles: 
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
