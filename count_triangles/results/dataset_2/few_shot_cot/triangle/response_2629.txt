Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - No triangle formed because 3 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 26) - No triangle formed because 6 and 26 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 26) - No triangle formed because 0 and 26 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) - No triangle formed because 6 and 18 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 25) - No triangle formed because 5 and 25 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 17) - No triangle formed because 0 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) - No triangle formed because 4 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) - No triangle formed because 4 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 22) - No triangle formed because 4 and 22 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) - No triangle formed because 5 and 15 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) - Triangle formed: <0, 6, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - No triangle formed because 7 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) - No triangle formed because 8 and 11 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) - No triangle formed because 9 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 29) - No triangle formed because 10 and 29 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No pairs to consider as the remaining nodes are not greater than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 12 to 30:
    * No triangles can be formed since there are less than 2 nodes greater than these nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 to Node 30: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
