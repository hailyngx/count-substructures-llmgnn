Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (0, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7. 

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
