Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 18 are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:

  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (1, 18) -> Already counted in Node 0's analysis.
  * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (18, 8) -> 18 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (18, 15) -> 18 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (5, 13) -> Already counted in Node 3's analysis.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Pair 1: (10, 7) -> 10 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
  * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* The other nodes don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.
  
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
