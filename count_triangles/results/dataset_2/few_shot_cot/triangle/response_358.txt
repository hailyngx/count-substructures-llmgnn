Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as there are not enough connected nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangle can be formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as there are not enough connected nodes greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 15) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Since there are not at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles with, no triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
