Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 22) -> Both 3 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 3) and (1, 4) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 12) in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (1, 29) -> 1 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
