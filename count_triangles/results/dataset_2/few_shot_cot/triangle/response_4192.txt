Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 7 are also connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 0) -> Node 3 and Node 0 are connected, but Node 3 and Node 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Node 3 and Node 4 are connected, but Node 3 and Node 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Node 3 and Node 7 are connected, but Node 3 and Node 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 2. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 0 are also connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skip as they do not have at least two greater numbered neighbor nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
