Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> Form a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: [0, 8, 15]
    * Pair 2: (8, 20) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed, not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (15, 20) -> Form a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: [0, 15, 20]
    * Pair 5: (15, 6) -> No triangle formed, not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (20, 6) -> No triangle formed, not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 27) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: [1, 15, 27]
    * Pair 2: (4, 27) -> No triangle formed, not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> No triangle formed, not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 6) -> No triangle formed, not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 26) -> No triangle formed, not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (12, 5) -> No triangle formed, not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 27) -> No triangle formed, not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 21) -> No triangle formed, not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 29) -> No triangle formed, not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (18, 24) -> No triangle formed, not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (19, 25) -> No triangle formed, not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 29:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Nodes 2 to 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 8, 15>
<0, 15, 20>
<1, 15, 27>
