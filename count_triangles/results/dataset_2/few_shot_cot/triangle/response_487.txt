Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (18, 11) -> 18 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not connected because there is no edge (11, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (18, 27) -> 18 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (27, 12) -> 27 and 12 are not connected because there is no edge (27, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continue this process for Nodes 4 through 29...
