Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (0, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (0, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 7), but since 6 and 7 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
