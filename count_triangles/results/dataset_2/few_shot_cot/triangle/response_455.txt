Response:
Following the step-by-step process demonstrated in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 29) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 29) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (29, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 27) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (18, 27) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (18, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (18, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (27, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (27, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (12, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 25) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 25) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - Triangle formed: <5, 8, 3>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 22) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (17, 22) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (8, 22) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (14, 22) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the rest of the nodes:

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 to 29:
    * No triangles can be formed as they have fewer than 2 nodes greater than their node number.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is [1 triangle] in the given graph.
