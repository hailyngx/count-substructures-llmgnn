Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 26) -> 15 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected to each other as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (15, 12) -> 15 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (26, 12) -> 26 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skipped all pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skipped all pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10:
    * Skipped all these nodes as they have smaller numbered nodes only.
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skipped all pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skipped all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20:
    * Skipped similar to above analysis.
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 21:
    * Pair 1: (10, 27) -> 10 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 21 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 21 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 21 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (27, 12) -> 27 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 21 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (27, 18) -> 27 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 21 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 21 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 22:
    * Pair 1: (1, 25) -> 1 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 22, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 22, but not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 24) -> 1 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 22, but not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (25, 4) -> 25 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 22, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (25, 24) -> 25 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 22, but are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 24) -> 4 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 22, but not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skipped as they have smaller connected nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Calculating the overall total triangles based on the above analysis:
[<0, 12, 26>, <1, 22, 25>]
