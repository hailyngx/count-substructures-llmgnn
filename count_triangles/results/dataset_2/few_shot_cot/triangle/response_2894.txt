Response:
Following the example provided, I will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed since 1, 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed since 1, 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected.
    * Pair 6: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are connected.
    * Pair 7: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed since 10, 14 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are connected.
    * Pair 9: (10, 6) -> No triangle formed since 10, 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are connected.
    * Pair 11: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4
    * Unique triangles involving Node 0: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 13>

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed since 3, 0 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed since 3, 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (14, 6) -> No triangle formed since 14, 6 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles involving Node 1: <1, 3, 14>

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles involving Node 2: <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 8>

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed since 3, 0 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed since 3, 6 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles involving Node 3: <3, 9, 13>

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed since 5, 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed since 5, 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed since 5, 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed since 5, 6 are not directly connected.
