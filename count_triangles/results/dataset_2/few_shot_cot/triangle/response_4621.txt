Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> Both 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 1) and (0, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 25) -> Both 1 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 27) -> Both 10 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (29, 19) -> Both 29 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (29, 19) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (23, 27) -> Both 23 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (23, 27) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 24) -> Both 11 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Both 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (9, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> Both 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Based on the detailed calculations above for each node, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <1, 0, 12> and <5, 23, 27>.
