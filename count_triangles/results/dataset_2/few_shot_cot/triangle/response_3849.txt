Response:
Following the same approach used in the example above to count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 27) -> 5 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 27) -> 13 and 27 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) - 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as per the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) - 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as per the edge list.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
        
The answer is [7].
