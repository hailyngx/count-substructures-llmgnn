Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - <0, 5, 9> forms a triangle.
    - No other triangles involving Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - <1, 5, 8> forms a triangle.
    - No other triangles involving Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - No triangles involving Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. Node 3:
    - No triangles involving Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. Node 4:
    - No triangles involving Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. Node 5:
    - <5, 9, 8> forms a triangle.
    - <5, 9, 0> forms a triangle.
    - <5, 9, 3> forms a triangle.
    - <5, 1, 4> forms a triangle.
    - <5, 0, 3> forms a triangle.
    - No other triangles involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 5

7. Node 6:
    - No triangles involving Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles involving Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8:
    - No triangles involving Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
    - <9, 8, 5> forms a triangle.
    - <9, 8, 1> forms a triangle.
    - No other triangles involving Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 5 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
