Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with 4, 9, and 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> Triangle formed with 4, 14, and 0.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed with 9, 14, and 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> Triangle formed with 7, 3, and 1.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> Triangle formed with 7, 11, and 1.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> Triangle formed with 7, 13, and 1.
    * Pair 4: (3, 11) -> Triangle formed with 3, 11, and 1.
    * Pair 5: (3, 13) -> Triangle formed with 3, 13, and 1.
    * Pair 6: (11, 13) -> Triangle formed with 11, 13, and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> No triangle formed as there is no direct link between 6 and 10.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> No triangle formed as there is no direct link between 6 and 11.
    * Pair 3: (10, 11) -> No triangle formed as there is no direct link between 10 and 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed with 7, 8, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Triangle formed with 5, 13, and 4.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> Triangle formed with 9, 13, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> No triangle formed as there is no direct link between 8 and 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed with 9, 14, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 1) -> Triangle formed with 13, 1, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 6 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
