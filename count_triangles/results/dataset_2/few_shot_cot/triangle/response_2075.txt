Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned before, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 9) -> 10 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (10, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (10, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (9, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (9, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with all previous nodes as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with all previous nodes as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with all previous nodes as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with all previous nodes as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with all previous nodes as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with all previous nodes as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with all previous nodes as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with all previous nodes as they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12 and Node 13:
    * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than 12 or 13.

* Node 14:
    * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than 14.

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4 to 13) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
