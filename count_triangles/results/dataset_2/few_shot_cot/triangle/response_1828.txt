Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 1). One side of triangle identified.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 2). One side of triangle identified.
    - Pair 5: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 1). One side of triangle identified.
    - Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 2). One side of triangle identified.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (9, 3). One side of triangle identified.
    - Pair 6: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 5:
    - These nodes are not considered as the smallest numbered node in any triangle formation.

Now it is time to move on to the next nodes. Let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (5, 3). One side of a triangle identified.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (5, 1). One side of a triangle identified.
    - Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (5, 3). One side of a triangle identified.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
