Response:
Following the same step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> Skipped as these nodes are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> Both 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 11 are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> Both 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 10 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 10 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Both 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 13 are directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 14 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> Both 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 13 and 7 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 1) -> Both 13 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 13 and 1 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, and 10:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 greater-numbered nodes to form triangles.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and 0 and 1 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and 6 and 7 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and 6 and 1 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and 9 and 4 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and 9 and 13 are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 2 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 10, 3>, <1, 11, 0>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 0, 10>, <4, 6, 13>, <5, 9, 14>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 13, 7>, <9, 14, 4>, <9, 14, 13>, <13, 6, 7>]
