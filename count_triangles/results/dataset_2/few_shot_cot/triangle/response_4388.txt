Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 (Node 5) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
