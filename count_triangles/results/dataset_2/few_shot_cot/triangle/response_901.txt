Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
