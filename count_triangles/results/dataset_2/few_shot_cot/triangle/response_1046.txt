Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * No new triangles can be formed as all pairs involve nodes smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * No new triangles can be formed as all pairs involve nodes smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8 and Node 9:
        * Skipped because there are no pairs that involve nodes greater than 8 or 9.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

    Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
