Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed because 1 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed because 1 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed because 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 9: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 0) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 0 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 0 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
