Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the previous example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 8 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (8, 2) -> Same logic as pair 1, 8 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Same logic as pair 1, 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Same logic as pair 1, 9 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 4: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> Same logic as pair 1 of Node 2, forming a triangle with Node 2.
        * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> Same logic as pair 1 of Node 1, no direct connection. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
        * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> Same logic as pair 2 of Node 4, 8 and 1 are directly connected. Triangle formed.

    * Node 7:
        * Skip the pair with Node 1 as it is smaller.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
        * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> Same logic as pair 1, forming a triangle with Node 4.
