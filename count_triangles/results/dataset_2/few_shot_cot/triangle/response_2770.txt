Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 18) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
