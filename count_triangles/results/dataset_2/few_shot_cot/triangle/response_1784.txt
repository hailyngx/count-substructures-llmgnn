Response:
Following the step-by-step method outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 21) -> Both 5 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 13) -> Both 21 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 14 are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 14>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 10) -> 17 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 11 are also connected. Triangle formed: <3, 8, 11>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 22) -> 8 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 24) -> 8 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 23) -> 8 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 22) -> 11 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <3, 11, 22>.
    * Pair 6: (11, 24) -> 11 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (11, 23) -> 11 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (22, 24) -> 22 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (22, 23) -> 22 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <3, 22, 23>.
    * Pair 10: (24, 23) -> 24 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for all remaining nodes will allow us to compute the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed to calculate and determine the final answer.
