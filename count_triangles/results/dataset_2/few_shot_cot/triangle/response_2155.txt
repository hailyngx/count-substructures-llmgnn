Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Connected! Triangle formed: <5, 6, 0>.
    - Pair 4: (9, 4) -> Connected! Triangle formed: <4, 9, 0>.
    - Pair 5: (9, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (4, 6) -> Connected! Triangle formed: <4, 6, 0>.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Connected! Triangle formed: <8, 9, 1>.
    - Pair 3: (9, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (7, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (8, 2) -> Connected! Triangle formed: <8, 2, 1>.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Connected! Triangle formed: <4, 6, 2>.
    - Pair 2: (4, 3) -> Connected! Triangle formed: <3, 4, 2>.
    - Pair 3: (6, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Connected! Triangle formed: <5, 4, 3>.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Connected! Triangle formed: <2, 6, 4>.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - No pairs to consider as all other nodes are greater than 5. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    - No pairs to consider as all other nodes are greater than 6. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    - No pairs to consider as all other nodes are greater than 7. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 0) -> Connected! Triangle formed: <5, 0, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9 triangles] in the given graph.
