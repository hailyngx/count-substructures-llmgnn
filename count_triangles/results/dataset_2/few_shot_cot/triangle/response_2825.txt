Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example provided, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Next, we will continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No new triangles can be formed involving Node 8 since there aren't at least 2 larger nodes connected to Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed involving Node 9 since there aren't at least 2 larger nodes connected to Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
