Response:
Following the step-by-step method outlined in the example provided, we will now determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle can form because 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors.
        * Pair 2: (1, 17) -> No triangle can form because 1 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors.
        * Pair 3: (1, 19) -> No triangle can form because 1 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors.
        * Pair 4: (7, 17) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 7, 17>.
        * Pair 5: (7, 19) -> No triangle can form because 7 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors.
        * Pair 6: (17, 19) -> No triangle can form because 17 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 0) -> No triangle can form because 3 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (10, 8) -> No triangle can form because 10 and 8 are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (10, 19) -> No triangle can form because 10 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors.
        * Pair 3: (8, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 8, 19>.
        * Pair 4: (8, 14) -> No triangle can form because 8 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors.
        * Pair 5: (8, 15) -> No triangle can form because 8 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors.
        * Pair 6: (19, 14) -> No triangle can form because 19 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors.
        * Pair 7: (19, 15) -> No triangle can form because 19 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Rest of the nodes (3 to 19):
        * Following the process described above for each node, we find no additional triangles.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

    Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

    Hence, the final answer is [2].
