Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Triangle: <2, 3, 18>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Triangle: <8, 11, 17>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Triangle: <9, 10, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Triangle: <13, 1, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 14:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 13) = 4

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
