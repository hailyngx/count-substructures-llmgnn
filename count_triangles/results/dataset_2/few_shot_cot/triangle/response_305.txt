Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
Following the method outlined in the previous example, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 1 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * No new triangles are formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
  * No new triangles are formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
  * No new triangles are formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
  * No new triangles are formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

<5, 0, 2>
