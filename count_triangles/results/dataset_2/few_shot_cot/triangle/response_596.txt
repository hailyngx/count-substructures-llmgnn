Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> Connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> Not connected directly. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Sum of triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node).
 
Therefore, there are [1] triangles in the given graph.
