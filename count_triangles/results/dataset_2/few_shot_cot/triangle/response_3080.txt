Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 5.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0. No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
