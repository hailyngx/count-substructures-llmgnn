Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 and Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 and Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 and Node 1.
    * Pair 7: (8, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 and Node 3.
    * Pair 8: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 and Node 6.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 6.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 and Node 4.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 and Node 3.
    * Pair 11: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (4, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 1.
    * Pair 13: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 and Node 8.
    * Pair 14: (8, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 and Node 5.
    * Pair 15: (8, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 and Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 7

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 and Node 3.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 and Node 3.
    * Pair 8: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 and Node 8.
    * Pair 5: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

The nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 are left to calculate, let's do that.
