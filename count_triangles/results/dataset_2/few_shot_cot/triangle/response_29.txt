Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected. Checking if they share a common neighbor:
        - Common neighbor: None
        - No triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 5: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are directly connected. Checking if they share a common neighbor:
        - Common neighbor: None
        - No triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 6: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 7: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 8: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 9: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 10: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 4: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are directly connected. Checking if they share a common neighbor:
        - Common neighbor: 1
        - Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 3, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping as there are no pairs involving Node 2 where both neighbors are greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are directly connected. Checking if they share a common neighbor:
        - Common neighbor: 13
        - Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 4, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are directly connected. Checking if they share a common neighbor:
        - Common neighbor: None
        - No triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are directly connected. Checking if they share a common neighbor:
        - Common neighbor: None
        - No triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are directly connected. Checking if they share a common neighbor:
        - Common neighbor: None
        - No triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

The process continues for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, considering all possible pairs of directly connected nodes to identify triangles. After completing this process, the total number of triangles found will be calculated and presented within brackets [].
