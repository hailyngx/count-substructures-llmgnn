Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

The list of unique triangles found is: 
[<0, 7, 12>, <2, 3, 9>, <7, 10, 16>, <9, 11, 15>, <10, 14, 16>, <13, 15, 19>, <15, 17, 19>, <10, 16, 19>, <13, 15, 19>].
