Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (7, 3) -> Node 7, and 3 are connected, but not via 0, so no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Node 4 is connected to 5 and 1, but 1 and 5 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Node 5, 8, 2 form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (8, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Node 5, 9, 4 form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Node 7, 8, 6 form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (8, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (2, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Node 6, 8, 7 form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 8 and 9:
    - Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

Output: [4]
