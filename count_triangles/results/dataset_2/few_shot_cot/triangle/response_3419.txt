Response:
Following the detailed steps outlined in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (13, 5) -> Triangle Formed: <0, 5, 13>.
    - Pair 2: (13, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (13, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (13, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (5, 1) -> Triangle Formed: <0, 1, 5>.
    - Pair 6: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (5, 6) -> Triangle Formed: <0, 5, 6>.
    - Pair 8: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (1, 11) -> Triangle Formed: <0, 1, 11>.
    - Pair 10: (1, 6) -> Triangle Formed: <0, 1, 6>.
    - Pair 11: (11, 6) -> No triangle formed.

    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    - Pair 1: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (13, 11) -> No triangle formed.

    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (13, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.

    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    - Pair 1: (10, 9) -> No triangle formed.

    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.

    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.

    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.

    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.

    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than Node 8.

    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than Node 9.

    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than Node 10.

* Node 11:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10.

* Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14 are all skipped due to not having at least 2 other nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0)
* Total triangles in the graph = [4]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
