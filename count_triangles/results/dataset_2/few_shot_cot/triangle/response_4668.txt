Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are connected via Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are connected via Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are connected via Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 1: (12, 17) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are connected via Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> No triangle can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Sum of triangles from all nodes)
Thus, the answer is [0].
