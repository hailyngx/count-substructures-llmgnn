Response:
Following the procedure described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph with 15 nodes:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Connected to 4 and 7, which are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> Connected to 4 and 2, but 4 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> Connected to 4 and 14, which are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> Connected to 7 and 2, but 7 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 14) -> Connected to 7 and 14, but 7 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 14) -> Connected to 2 and 14, which are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pairs: (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 8) are not considered as they involve nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Connected to 3 and 5, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Connected to 3 and 8, but 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Connected to 5 and 8, which are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs with nodes smaller than 2 are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Connected to 9 and 13, which are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * No triangle can be formed with these nodes as all other nodes that they can form triangles with are smaller than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
