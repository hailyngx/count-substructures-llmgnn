* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 11 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> Triangle formed as 9 and 4 are connected and 4 and 5 are connected. Triangle <4, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 6: (9, 6) -> Triangle formed as 9 and 6 are connected and 6 and 4 are connected. Triangle <4, 6, 9>.

    * Pair 4: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 3 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping all pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1)

    * Pair 2: (11, 2) -> No triangle formed as 11 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3)
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Triangle formed as 5 and 12 are connected and 12 and 4 are connected. Triangle <4, 5, 12>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No direct connection between 5 and 6.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> No direct connection between 5 and 0.
    * Pair 4: (12, 7) -> No direct connection between 12 and 7.

    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> No direct connection between 10 and 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 to Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there aren't at least two nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Output: [6]
