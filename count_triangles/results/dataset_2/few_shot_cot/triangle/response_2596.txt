Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge between 3 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge between 8 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Triangle formed <1, 3, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge between 10 and 18. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> Triangle formed <2, 11, 12>.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue the process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 3: 
    * Total triangles: 1

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles: 2

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles: 1

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Total triangles for each: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = Total triangles for each node.
[1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0] = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
