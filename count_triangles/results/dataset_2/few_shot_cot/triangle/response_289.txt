Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped since Node 2 is the smallest.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped since Node 3 is the smallest.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped since Node 4 is the smallest.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped since Node 5 is the smallest.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped since Node 6 is the smallest.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped since Node 7 is the smallest.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped since Node 8 is the smallest.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped since Node 9 is the smallest.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
