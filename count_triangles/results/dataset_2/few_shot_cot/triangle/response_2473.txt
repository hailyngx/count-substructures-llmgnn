        Let's proceed with finding the triangles:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17 as it is connected to both Node 4 and Node 12.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14 as it is connected to both Node 5 and Node 12.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 3:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 4:
            * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 5:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 as it is connected to both Node 14 and Node 18.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 8:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 9:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 10:
            * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as it is connected to both Node 6 and Node 17.
            * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 11:
            * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 as it is connected to both Node 7 and Node 14.
            * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 12:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 13:

            * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 15:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 16:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) = 5.

        Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
