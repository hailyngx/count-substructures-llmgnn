Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (22, 23) -> 22 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 22 and 23 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 22) -> 15 and 22 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 23) -> 15 and 23 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (23, 25) -> 23 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 23 and 25 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (23, 6) -> 23 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 25) -> 6 and 25 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 29) -> 5 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 29 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 29) -> 2 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 2 and 29 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 29) -> 19 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 6 to 29:

* Node 6: 1 triangle
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 1 triangle
* Node 9: 1 triangle
* Nodes 10 to 19 have 0 triangles
* Node 20: 2 triangles
* Nodes 21 to 29 have 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Nodes 10-19) + 2 (Node 20) + 0 (Nodes 21-29) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
