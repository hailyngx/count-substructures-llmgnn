Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 14 are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 11 are also connected. 
    * Pair 5: (14, 4) -> 14 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 13) -> Both 14 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 3 are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 12 are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 8 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 11 and 8 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 7 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 4 are also connected. 
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, and then sum up the total number of triangles.

After going through all the nodes and counting the triangles, the final answer is:

[<1, 3, 7>, <1, 8, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 11>, <4, 12, 3>, <4, 12, 11>, <5, 9, 4>, <9, 3, 2>, <11, 14, 7>, <14, 7, 9>, <14, 7, 11>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
