Response:
Following the same step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> Triangle formed: <0, 9, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes can form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes can form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes can form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes can form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes can form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes can form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes can form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes can form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes can form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> Triangle formed: <0, 10, 13>
    * No other nodes can form triangles with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 11.
    * No other nodes can form triangles with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 12.
    * No other nodes can form triangles with Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 13.
    * No other nodes can form triangles with Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 14.
    * No other nodes can form triangles with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 10) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
   
Therefore, the final answer is: [3].
