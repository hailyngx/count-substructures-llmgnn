Response:
Following the same method as the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16: <0, 1, 16>
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <0, 1, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <0, 1, 16>
    * Pair 4: (14, 16) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <1, 14, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (17, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15: <2, 6, 15>
    * Pair 2: (17, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <2, 4, 15>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <1, 3, 6>
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17: <7, 13, 17>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16: <8, 16, 18>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 8 as Node 8 is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Have no other nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (11, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 15 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17, 18, 19:
    * Have no other nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [8] <0, 1, 16> <0, 1, 5> <1, 14, 7> <2, 4, 15> <1, 3, 6> <7, 13, 17> <8, 16, 18> <2, 6, 15>.
