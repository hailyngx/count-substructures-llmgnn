Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 0 are connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 0 and 4. The only node connected to both 0 and 4 is node 9. Therefore, the triangle <0, 4, 9> is formed.
    - Pair 4: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Triangles involving Node 1 have already been counted in previous iterations. No additional triangles to count.

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 2 and 4. The only node connected to both 2 and 4 is node 8. Therefore, the triangle <2, 4, 8> is formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 2 are connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 2 and 4. The only node connected to both 2 and 4 is node 8. Therefore, the triangle <2, 4, 8> is formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 3 are connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 2 and 7. The only node connected to both 2 and 7 is node 8. Therefore, the triangle <2, 7, 8> is formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 3 are connected. Checking for the third node connected to both 3 and 7. The only node connected to both 3 and 7 is node 8. Therefore, the triangle <3, 7, 8> is formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Triangles involving Node 4 have already been counted in previous iterations. No additional triangles to count.

* Node 5:
    - Triangles involving Node 5 have already been counted in previous iterations. No additional triangles to count.

* Node 6:
    - Triangles involving Node 6 have already been counted in previous iterations. No additional triangles to count.

* Node 7:
    - Triangles involving Node 7 have already been counted in previous iterations. No additional triangles to count.

* Node 8:
    - Triangles involving Node 8 have already been counted in previous iterations. No additional triangles to count.

* Node 9:
    - Triangles involving Node 9 have already been counted in previous iterations. No additional triangles to count.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
