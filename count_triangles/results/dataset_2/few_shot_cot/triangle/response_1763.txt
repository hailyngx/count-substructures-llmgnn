Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node individually:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 because it doesn't have at least two 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 because it doesn't have at least two 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 2:
    * Triangle: <2, 6, 1>

* Node 3:
    * Triangle: <3, 6, 1>

* Node 4:
    * Triangle: <4, 7, 3>

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 because it doesn't have at least two 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 because it doesn't have at least two 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 because it doesn't have at least two 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 because it doesn't have at least two 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 because it doesn't have at least two 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
