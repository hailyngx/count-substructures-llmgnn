Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <0, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <0, 3, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 1: <1, 3, 9>
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 1: <1, 3, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <1, 2, 9>
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 2: <1, 2, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 3: <2, 3, 9>
    * Pair 2: (2, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 3: <1, 2, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <0, 4, 6>
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <0, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 6: <4, 6, 8>
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 6: <0, 4, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 7: <0, 3, 7>
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 7: <0, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 8: <6, 8, 3>
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 8: <6, 7, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 9: <1, 3, 9>
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 9: <1, 2, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.
