Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are greater than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) - Skip as it is an edge between the node itself.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 3) - Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6 as they are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6 as they are greater than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it is greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8, 9 as they are greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles found: <2, 4, 7> <4, 7, 8>
