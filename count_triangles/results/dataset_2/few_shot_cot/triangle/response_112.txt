Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle <0, 4, 5> formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 11) -> Triangle <1, 3, 11> formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (13, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (13, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 10 to 14:
    - Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

[<0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 11>]
