Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (13, 3) -> 13 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's sum up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [5].
