Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 13 are also connected as there is an edge between them in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they do not share a direct edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving 0 and 1 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 11) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (11, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pairs involving 0, 1, and 2 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (12, 13) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pairs involving Nodes 1 and 4 are skipped.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

* Summarizing the triangles found:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [11].
