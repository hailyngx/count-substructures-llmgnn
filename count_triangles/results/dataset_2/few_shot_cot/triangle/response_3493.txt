Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 11.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are not connected because (1, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected because (1, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 6: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not connected because (8, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 8: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not connected because (11, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (11, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 10: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are not connected because (14, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 10), but since 3 and 10 are smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the output should be [4].
