Response:
Following the step-by-step process detailed in the example, we'll compute the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 15) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 18) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 15) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 12) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 18) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (15, 12) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (15, 18) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (12, 18) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 29) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 29) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 9) -> Connected. Now, we have to find the third node to form a triangle.
        * Pair (8, 9) leads to Node 2.
        * Hence, the triangle is <1, 2, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Continue from Pair 5 of Node 1 as it involves Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (2, 24) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> Connected. Now, we have to find the third node to form a triangle.
        * Pair (2, 0) leads to Node 8 which was already accounted for in the triangle <1, 2, 9>.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 3 to 29:
    * Skipping as they are either already considered in previous triangles or do not have enough higher-numbered neighbors to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:

- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3 to 29) = 1.

Thus, [1 triangle] is present in the given graph, represented by the unique triangle <1, 2, 9>.
