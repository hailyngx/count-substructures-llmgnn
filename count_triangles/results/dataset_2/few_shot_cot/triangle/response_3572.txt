Response:
Following the same steps as shown in the example before:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 12 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 12). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * The only node it is connected to is smaller than 2, so no triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 9 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 10 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 7 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, but 1 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, but 1 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and 3 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
