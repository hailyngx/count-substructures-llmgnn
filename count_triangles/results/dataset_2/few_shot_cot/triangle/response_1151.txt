Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2)

Node 4 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as explained in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected. Checking third node:
        * (6, 8, 7): Triangle formed with nodes 6, 8, and 7.
    * Pair 5: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected. Checking third node:
        * (4, 7, 3): Triangle formed with nodes 4, 7, and 3.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are connected. Checking third node:
        * (4, 3, 1): Triangle formed with nodes 4, 3, and 1.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are connected. Checking third node:
        * (4, 2, 1): Triangle formed with nodes 4, 2, and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected. Checking third node:
        * (4, 5, 7): Triangle formed with nodes 4, 5, and 7.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are connected. Checking third node:
        * (4, 1, 7): Triangle formed with nodes 4, 1, and 7.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are connected. Checking third node:
        * (4, 0, 3): Triangle formed with nodes 4, 0, and 3.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected. Checking third node:
        * (5, 7, 3): Triangle formed with nodes 5, 7, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Already counted in Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are connected. Checking third node:
        * (7, 1, 4): Triangle formed with nodes 7, 1, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

I will continue this process to find the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's check the remaining nodes.
