Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - To be completed after considering other nodes.

* Node 3:
    - To be completed after considering other nodes.

* Node 4:
    - To be completed after considering other nodes.

* Node 5:
    - To be completed after considering other nodes.

* Node 6:
    - To be completed after considering other nodes.

* Node 7:
    - To be completed after considering other nodes.

* Node 8:
    - To be completed after considering other nodes.

* Node 9:
    - To be completed after considering other nodes.

* Node 10:
    - To be completed after considering other nodes.

* Node 11:
    - To be completed after considering other nodes.

* Node 12:
    - To be completed after considering other nodes.

* Node 13:
    - To be completed after considering other nodes.

* Node 14:
    - To be completed after considering other nodes.

Let's now finish the calculations for Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
