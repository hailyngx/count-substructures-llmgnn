Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (15, 2) -> 15 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs of nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
