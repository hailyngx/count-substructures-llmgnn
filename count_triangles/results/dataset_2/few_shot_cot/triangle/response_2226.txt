Response:
Following the step-by-step process as outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 28) -> 8 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 23) -> 8 and 23 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 23) -> 28 and 23 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (21, 25) -> Both 21 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected.
    * Pair 2: (21, 20) -> 21 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (21, 24) -> 21 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (11, 21) -> Both 11 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (11, 18) -> Both 11 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (11, 19) -> Both 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (28, 6) -> 28 and 6 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Pair 2: (28, 12) -> 28 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> Both 11 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> Both 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (20, 22) -> 20 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Continuing this process until Node 29, we find the number of triangles for each node.

Summing up all the triangles from each node: 
Total number of triangles in the graph = [0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 1 (Node 22) + 1 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 1 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29)] = 16

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
