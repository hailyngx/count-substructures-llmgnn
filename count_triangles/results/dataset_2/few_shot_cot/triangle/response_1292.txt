Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (20, 28) -> Both 20 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (28, 5) -> Both 28 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (23, 4) -> Both 23 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (23, 26) -> Both 23 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (23, 6) -> Both 23 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 26) -> Both 4 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (26, 6) -> Both 26 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (22, 8) -> Both 22 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (13, 26) -> Both 13 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Continuing this process for Nodes 5 to 29, we get:
    * Node 5: 1 triangle
    * Node 6: 4 triangles
    * Node 7: 1 triangle
    * Node 8: 0 triangles
    * Node 9: 2 triangles
    * Node 10: 0 triangles
    * Node 11: 1 triangle
    * Node 12: 3 triangles
    * Node 13: 1 triangle
    * Node 14: 0 triangles
    * Node 15: 0 triangles
    * Node 16: 0 triangles
    * Node 17: 2 triangles
    * Node 18: 0 triangles
    * Node 19: 1 triangle
    * Node 20: 1 triangle
    * Node 21: 2 triangles
    * Node 22: 2 triangles
    * Node 23: 1 triangle
    * Node 24: 1 triangle
    * Node 25: 1 triangle
    * Node 26: 1 triangle
    * Node 27: 0 triangles
    * Node 28: 0 triangles
    * Node 29: 1 triangle
    
Summing up the triangles for all nodes:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 36

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [36].
