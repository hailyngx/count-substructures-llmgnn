Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [11].
