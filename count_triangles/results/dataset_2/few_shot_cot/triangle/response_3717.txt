Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are connected, and 7 is the 1-hop neighbor of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are connected, and 7 is the 1-hop neighbor of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are not considered as they are not greater than 1.
    * Pair 5: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are connected, and 11 is the 1-hop neighbor of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not considered as they are not greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 5. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are connected, and 1 is the 1-hop neighbor of 6. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
