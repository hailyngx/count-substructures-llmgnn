Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Yes, 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are connected as (6, 9).
    * Pair 2: (9, 20) -> Yes, 9 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 20) -> Yes, 6 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 20).
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> Yes, 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 14) -> Yes, 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 26) -> Yes, 14 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 14 and 26 are connected as (14, 26).
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> Yes, 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Yes, 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 27) -> Yes, 6 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 27 are connected as (6, 27).
    * Pair 2: (3, 29) -> Yes, 3 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 29 are connected as (3, 29).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 21) -> Yes, 9 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 21 are connected as (9, 21).
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Yes, 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 10 are connected as (4, 10).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (26, 5) -> Yes, 26 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 6 to 29 and summing up the total triangles:

[Total number of triangles in the graph: 19]
[List of unique triangles: 
<0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 20>, <0, 9, 20>, <1, 14, 26>, <3, 6, 27>, <3, 3, 29>, <4, 9, 21>, <4, 4, 10>, <16, 16, 20>, <16, 16, 28>, <16, 16, 19>, <16, 20, 18>, <16, 20, 12>, <16, 18, 19>, <16, 18, 15>, <16, 18, 11>, <17, 17, 10>, <24, 24, 19>, <24, 24, 29>]
