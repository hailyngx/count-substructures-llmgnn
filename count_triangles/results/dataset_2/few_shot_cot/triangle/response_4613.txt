Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since 0 is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 11, 2>
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 11, 6>
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 9, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 9, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, and then calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.
