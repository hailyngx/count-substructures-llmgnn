Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (22, 28) -> 22 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 15) -> 22 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 3) -> 22 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (28, 15) -> 28 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (28, 3) -> 28 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 4) -> 12 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 26) -> 9 and 26 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (26, 18) -> 26 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (26, 0) -> 26 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (18, 0) -> 18 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (19, 21) -> 19 and 21 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (13, 23) -> 13 and 23 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 1) -> 13 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 25) -> 13 and 25 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (23, 1) -> 23 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (23, 25) -> 23 and 25 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 25) -> 1 and 25 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (28, 10) -> 28 and 10 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 7 to 29, and summing up the total triangles for each node, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
