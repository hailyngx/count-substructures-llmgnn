Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

16. Node 15:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

17. Node 16:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

18. Node 17:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

19. Node 18:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

20. Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph: [0]

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
