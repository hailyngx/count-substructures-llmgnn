Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Follow the same process as above to count triangles for each of these nodes.

* After calculating for all nodes, sum up the total number of triangles.

Finally, provide the answer in brackets [] with the unique triangles found inside <> each only once.
