Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the step-by-step process:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) --> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) --> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) --> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) --> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) --> 5 and 7 are connected and 7 is 1-hop neighbor of 0, triangle formed: <0, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 6: (9, 4) --> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected, triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 7: (9, 8) --> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected, triangle formed: <0, 8, 9>.
    * Pair 8: (9, 2) --> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (9, 7) --> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 4) --> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected, triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) --> 9 and 4 are connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
[<0, 5, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <8, 9, 4>]

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
