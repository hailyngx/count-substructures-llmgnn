Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided with the specific details of your graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 29) -> 11 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 27) -> 7 and 27 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 27) -> 13 and 27 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (26, 27) -> 26 and 27 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (20, 22) -> 20 and 22 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (20, 14) -> 20 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 1) -> 20 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (22, 14) -> 22 and 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (15, 10) -> 15 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 29:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 10 to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
