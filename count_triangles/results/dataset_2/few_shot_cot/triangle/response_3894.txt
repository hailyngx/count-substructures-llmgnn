Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the new graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 21) -> 2 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 21) -> 14 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 21) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 26) -> 10 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 16) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (16, 26) -> 16 and 26 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (14, 18) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 21) -> Already counted previously.
    * Pair 3: (18, 21) -> 18 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 21) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 20) -> 6 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 29) -> 6 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 5 to 29:

* Node 5: Total triangles = 0
* Node 6: Total triangles = 0
* Node 7: Total triangles = 0
* Node 8: Total triangles = 0
* Node 9: Total triangles = 0
* Node 10: Total triangles = 0
* Node 11: Total triangles = 0
* Node 12: Total triangles = 1
* Node 13: Total triangles = 0
* Node 14: Total triangles = 0
* Node 15: Total triangles = 0
* Node 16: Total triangles = 0
* Node 17: Total triangles = 0
* Node 18: Total triangles = 0
* Node 19: Total triangles = 0
* Node 20: Total triangles = 0
* Node 21: Total triangles = 0
* Node 22: Total triangles = 0
* Node 23: Total triangles = 0
* Node 24: Total triangles = 0
* Node 25: Total triangles = 0
* Node 26: Total triangles = 0
* Node 27: Total triangles = 0
* Node 28: Total triangles = 0
* Node 29: Total triangles = 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3 to 29) + 0 (Nodes without at least 2 nodes greater) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles are: 
[<0, 14, 18>, <0, 14, 2>, <1, 10, 16>]
