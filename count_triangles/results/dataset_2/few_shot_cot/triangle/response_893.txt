Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 13.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 13.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 10.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 7.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 4

No other nodes to consider for forming triangles. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 4 (Node 5) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.

The final answer is [12].
