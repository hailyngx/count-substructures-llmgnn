Response:
Following the example given, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 27) -> 2 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 28) -> 2 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 21) -> 2 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 21 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (27, 28) -> 27 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 27 and 28 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because there is no edge connecting them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 27) -> 1 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (18, 27) -> 18 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 18 and 27 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 22) -> 2 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 22 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * There are no connections from Node 3 to any other nodes, so no triangles can be formed.

Continue this process for Nodes 4 to 29 following the example given. 

Finally, sum up all the triangles found for each node to get the total number of triangles in the graph. 

Please proceed with this step-by-step process to find the final answer.
