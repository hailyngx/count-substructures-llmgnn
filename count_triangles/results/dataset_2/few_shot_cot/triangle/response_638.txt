Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 13) -> Triangle <0, 3, 13> formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (13, 6) -> No triangle formed as 13 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (13, 2) -> No triangle formed as 13 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> Triangle <2, 4, 10> formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
