Response:
Taking the step-by-step approach, let's count the triangles in the provided graph by computing the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are connected. **Triangle formed** with Node 1.

    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes or Nodes 1 and 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:

    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes or Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes or Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes or Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes or Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes or Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are connected. **Triangle formed** with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles found are:  
<1, 11, 2>  
<1, 13, 11>  
<2, 13, 4>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<4, 6, 8>  
<4, 7, 8>  
<6, 7, 13>  
<0, 10, 14>  

So, the final answer is [8].
