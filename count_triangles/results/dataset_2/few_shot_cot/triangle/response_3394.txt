Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 9, 4>
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * ...
        * 
        * 
        *
