Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as there are no triangles that contain Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as there are no triangles that contain Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
  
* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
