Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Skipped as 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Skipped as 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> Skipped as 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Skipped as 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (9, 1) -> Skipped as 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0.
    * Pair 7: (9, 6) -> Skipped as 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0.
    * Pair 8: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1


* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> Skipped as 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1.
    * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> Skipped as 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1.
    * Pair 4: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 1, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of node 2, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of node 2, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 2, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 4: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of node 2, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 2, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 2, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
