Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 10: <0, 9, 14>
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 12: <0, 9, 10>
    * Pair 3: (9, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 6: <0, 14, 10>
    * Pair 5: (14, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No connections, no triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 12: <3, 7, 12>
    * Pair 6: (18, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 17: <3, 12, 18>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (19, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:

    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (16, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 10: <0, 9, 11>
    * Pair 4: (17, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 11: <9, 10, 17>
    * Pair 5: (17, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (17, 16) -> Triangle formed with Node 11: <10, 11, 17>
    * Pair 2: (17, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * No new triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No new triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No connections, no triangles.

* Node 14:
    * No new triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than Node 14.

* Node 15:

* Node 16:
    * No new triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than Node 16.

* Node 17:
    * No new triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * No new triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than Node 18.

* Node 19:
    * No new triangles can be formed with the nodes greater than Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
