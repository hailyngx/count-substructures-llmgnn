        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8:
        * Skipped pairs as there aren't enough nodes larger than 5, 6, 7, or 8 to form a triangle.

    * Node 9:

        * Pair 1: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are connected as (13, 11). No third node connected to both 13 and 11. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are connected as (13, 10). No third node connected to both 13 and 10. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are connected as (13, 0). No third node connected to both 13 and 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (11, 10) -> 11 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
        * Skipped pairs as there aren't enough nodes larger than 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 to form a triangle.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    [Triangles found:  <14, 2, 6>] 
    [Total triangles in the graph: 1] 

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
