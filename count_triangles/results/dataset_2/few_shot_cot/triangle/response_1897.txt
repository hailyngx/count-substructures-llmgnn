Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
	* Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
	* Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 2:
	* Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
	* Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
	* Pair 2: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 4:
	* Skip node 1 as it is smaller than 4.
	* Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
	* Pair 2: (18, 1) -> 18 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
	* Pair 3: (18, 3) -> 18 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 5:
	* Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
	* Pair 2: (17, 7) -> 17 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
	* Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
	* Pair 2: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
	* Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
	* Skip the pairs involving nodes smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
	* Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 10:
	* Pair 1: (16, 12) -> 16 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
	* No other pairs available for node 10.

* Node 11:
	* No pairs available.

* Node 12:
	* No pairs available.

* Node 13:
	* No pairs available.

* Node 14:
	* Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 14.

* Node 15:
	* Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 15.

* Node 16:
	* Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 16.

* Node 17:
	* Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 17.

* Node 18:
	* Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 18.

* Node 19:
	* No pairs available.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
