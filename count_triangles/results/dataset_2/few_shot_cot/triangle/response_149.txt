Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 11) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (5, 11) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 13) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 10) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (9, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 7.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
