Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node:  0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> Both 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles with node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Both 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Both 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles with node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> Both 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles found are:
[<0, 2, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 10, 11>, <4, 13, 5>, <9, 0, 2>, <14, 1, 6>]
