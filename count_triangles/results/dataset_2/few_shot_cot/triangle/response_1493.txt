Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Both 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 13) -> Both 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (2, 1) -> Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 0) -> Both 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 14) -> Both 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

- Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    - Follow the same process to find the triangles for each of these nodes.

Calculating the total number of triangles by adding up the triangles found for each node:
Total number of triangles = [Total triangles for Node 0 + Total triangles for Node 1 + Total triangles for Node 2 + ...]

Please carry out this process for the remaining nodes and provide the final answer in brackets [].
