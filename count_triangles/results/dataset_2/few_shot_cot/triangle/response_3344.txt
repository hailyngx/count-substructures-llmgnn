Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Node 1 and Node 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - Node 1 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Node 3 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) - Node 3 and Node 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) - Node 9 and Node 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) - Node 7 and Node 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Proceed with the same steps for the remaining nodes in the graph and count the total number of triangles.

The final answer will be inside brackets [].

Let's continue this process for Nodes 3 to 19.
