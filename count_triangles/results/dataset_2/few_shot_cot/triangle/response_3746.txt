Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 1 are also connected as (0, 3) and (1, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 10 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 10 are also connected as (0, 3) and (0, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (9, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 6 are also connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles possible with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 5 are also connected as (9, 1) and (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles possible with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles possible with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Since Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes, no triangles are possible with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles possible with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles possible with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No triangles possible with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * No triangles possible with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
