Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected as (1, 6) and are 1-hop neighbors of 1. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (4, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are connected as (6, 13) but not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Already counted when considering Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 do not have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles. 

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
So the final answer is [13].
