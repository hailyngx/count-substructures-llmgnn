Response:
Following the method from the previous example, let's determine the number of triangles in the provided graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 22) -> 3 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 22 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 19 are directly connected as (3, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (22, 19) -> 22 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 22 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 18 are directly connected as (7, 18) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 15 are directly connected as (7, 15) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (18, 15) -> 18 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 18 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 20:
    * No possible triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 21:
    * No possible triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 22:
    * No possible triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 23:
    * No possible triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 24:
    * No possible triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 25:
    * No possible triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 26:
    * No possible triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 27:
    * No possible triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 28:
    * No possible triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 29:
    * No possible triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
