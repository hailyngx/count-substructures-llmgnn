Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (21, 29) -> Node 21 and Node 29 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (21, 13) -> Node 21 and Node 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (21, 28) -> Node 21 and Node 28 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (21, 5) -> Node 21 and Node 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (29, 13) -> Node 29 and Node 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (29, 28) -> Node 29 and Node 28 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (29, 5) -> Node 29 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (13, 28) -> Node 13 and Node 28 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (13, 5) -> Node 13 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 10: (28, 5) -> Node 28 and Node 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1**:
    - Pairs involving Node 9:
        - (9, 7): Not connected directly. No triangle.
        - (9, 24): Not connected directly. No triangle.
    - Pair 3: (7, 24) -> Node 7 and Node 24 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2**:
    - No possible triangles with Nodes smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3**:
    - Pairs involving Node 22:
        - (22, 23): Not connected directly. No triangle.
        - (22, 19): Not connected directly. No triangle.
        - (22, 12): Not connected directly. No triangle.
    - Pairs involving Node 23:
        - (23, 19): Not connected directly. No triangle.
        - (23, 12): Not connected directly. No triangle.
    - Pairs involving Node 19:
        - (19, 6): Node 19 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 but not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Pairs involving Node 12:
        - (12, 6): Node 12 and Node 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

5. **Node 4**:
    - Pairs involving Node 26:
        - (26, 10): Node 26 and Node 10 are not directly connected. No triangle.
        - (26, 24): Node 26 and Node 24 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 3: (10, 24) -> Node 10 and Node 24 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Continue the same process for Nodes 5 to 29.

7. Summarizing the triangles:
    - Total triangles in the graph = Count of triangles from all nodes.
    - Result: [ The total number of triangles and the unique triangles should be presented here inside brackets and angle brackets respectively.]
