Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes 11 and 24.
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes 4 and 19.
    * Pair 1: (26, 4) -> 26 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes 26 and 29.
    * Pair 1: (26, 8) -> 26 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes 20 and 28.
    * Pair 1: (21, 6) -> 21 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes 13, 17, and 18.
    * Pair 1: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 25) -> 17 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes 6 and 27.
    * Pair 1: (6, 28) -> 6 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pair with smaller node 21.
    * Pair 1: (21, 25) -> 21 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pair with smaller node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pair with smaller node 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pair with smaller node 10.
    * Pair 1: (9, 20) -> 9 and 20 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0
