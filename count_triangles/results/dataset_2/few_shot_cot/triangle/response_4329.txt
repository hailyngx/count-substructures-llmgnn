Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and 7.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 2) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 14) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 and 7.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 and 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (12, 9) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (13, 2) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13 and Node 14:
    * Not enough remaining nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 and Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0 (for each)

Summarizing, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <4, 7, 0>, <3, 5, 14>, and <6, 8, 11>.
