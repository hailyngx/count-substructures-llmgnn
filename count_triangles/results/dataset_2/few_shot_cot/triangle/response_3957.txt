Response:
Let's start counting the triangles in the given graph by examining each node's 1-hop neighbor sets and finding the triangles formed by each node.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 11 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 14 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 1 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
