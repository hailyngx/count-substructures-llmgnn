Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph using each node as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 26) -> 5 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 26). Triange formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 15) -> 0 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (18, 23) -> 18 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 28) -> 1 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 28). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Already counted in Node 2. Skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (18, 22) -> 18 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (18, 22). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 29) -> 11 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (5, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Already counted in Node 2. Skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 22) -> 7 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (7, 22). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 8: 0 triangle
* Node 9: 0 triangle
* Node 10: 0 triangle
* Node 11: 0 triangle
* Node 12: 0 triangle
* Node 13: 0 triangle
* Node 14: 0 triangle
* Node 15: 0 triangle
* Node 16: 0 triangle
* Node 17: 0 triangle
* Node 18: 0 triangle
* Node 19: 0 triangle
* Node 20: 0 triangle
* Node 21: 0 triangle
* Node 22: 1 triangle
* Node 23: 0 triangle
* Node 24: 0 triangle
* Node 25: 0 triangle
* Node 26: 0 triangle
* Node 27: 0 triangle
* Node 28: 0 triangle
* Node 29: 0 triangle

Sum of triangles = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 22) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
