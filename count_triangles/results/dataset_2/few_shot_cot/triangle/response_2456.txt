Response:
Following the same process as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> <0, 2, 8>
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> <0, 5, 3>
    * Pair 3: (0, 14) -> <0, 14, 13>
    * Pair 4: (0, 2) -> <0, 2, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> <1, 7, 11>
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> <1, 8, 6>
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> <1, 14, 13>
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) -> <1, 2, 7>
    * Pair 5: (1, 4) -> <1, 4, 10>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> <2, 6, 12>
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> <2, 7, 11>
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> <2, 8, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> <6, 12, 9>
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> <6, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [14].
