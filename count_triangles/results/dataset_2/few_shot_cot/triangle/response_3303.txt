Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - No triangles involving Node 0 as one of the vertices.

2. Node 1:
    - No triangles involving Node 1 as one of the vertices.

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    - Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - No triangles involving Node 3 as one of the vertices.

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.

6. Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 5.
    - Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 5.
    - Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles involving Node 7 as one of the vertices.

9. Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.

10. Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. Node 10:
    - No triangles involving Node 10 as one of the vertices.

12. Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.

13. Node 12:
    - No triangles involving Node 12 as one of the vertices.

14. Node 13:
    - No triangles involving Node 13 as one of the vertices.

15. Node 14:
    - No triangles involving Node 14 as one of the vertices.

Adding up the total number of triangles from each node:
Total triangles = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
