Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 11) -> Both 0 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are directly connected as (0, 11) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 14) -> Both 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 12, and they are directly connected as (1, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - No pairs to consider involving Node 0 or Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 11) -> Both 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 13) -> Both 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 12) -> Both 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 13, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (4, 2) -> Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 12, and they are directly connected as (4, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 12) -> Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9.

8. Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (11, 0) -> Both 11 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are directly connected as (11, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (11, 4) -> Both 11 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 12, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 2

10. Node 12, 13, and 14:
    - Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than 12, 13, or 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 (Node 11) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
