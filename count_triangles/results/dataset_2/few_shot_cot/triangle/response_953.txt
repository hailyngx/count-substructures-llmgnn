Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) - Both 10 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) - Both 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 23) - Both 8 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs because there are no other nodes larger than Node 2 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 28) - Both 11 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 20) - Both 12 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) - Both 11 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.

We continue this process for the remaining nodes in the graph so that we can provide an answer. Let's explore the triangles in the graph further.
