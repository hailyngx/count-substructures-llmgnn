Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (12, 14) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (9, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    - No pairs to consider as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are connected as (9, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected as (5, 14) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
Finally, the answer is [7].
