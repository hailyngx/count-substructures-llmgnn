Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 25) -> Both 3 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (25, 5) -> 25 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (25, 6) -> 25 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 27) -> Both 7 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (13, 9) -> Both 13 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (13, 27) -> Both 13 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (9, 27) -> Both 9 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (12, 10) -> Both 12 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (12, 21) -> Both 12 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (10, 21) -> Both 10 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 29) -> Both 4 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 23) -> Both 4 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (29, 23) -> Both 29 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - Pairs involving Node 0 have already been considered, so no new triangles can be formed.

- Node 6:
    - Pairs involving Node 0 have already been considered, so no new triangles can be formed.

- Node 7:
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    - Similar to above, no triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
