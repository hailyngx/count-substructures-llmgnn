Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 20) -> 10 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 6) -> 20 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 22) -> 10 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 15) -> 22 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 4) -> 12 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 24) -> 12 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 24) -> 4 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 24) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 20) -> 12 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 19) -> 20 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 28) -> 8 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 21) -> 8 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 21) -> 28 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

This process will be continued for the remaining nodes, and the final count of triangles will be determined.
