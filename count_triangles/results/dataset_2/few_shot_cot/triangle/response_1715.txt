Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Potential triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Potential triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Potential triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Potential triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Potential triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Potential triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 4: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. Potential triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5 to 9:
    * Skip further calculations as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
