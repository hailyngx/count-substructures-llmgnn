Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the same process as the example, let's count the triangles step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 6 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
