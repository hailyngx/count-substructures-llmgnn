Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 28) -> 15 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (15, 28) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (15, 10) -> 15 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (15, 10) in the list. No triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs left to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs left to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (21, 11) -> 21 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (21, 11) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (21, 20) -> 21 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, but 20 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 3. No triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs left to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (21, 13) -> 21 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (21, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (21, 17) -> 21 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs left to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Continue this process for the remaining nodes following the same steps.

By calculating the total number of triangles formed with each node as the smallest numbered node and adding them up, we can find the total number of triangles in the graph. The final answer should be provided inside brackets [].
