Following the same method as described in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 22) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 22) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (18, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 7) -> No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
