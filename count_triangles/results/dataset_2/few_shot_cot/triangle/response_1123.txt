Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example given with each node, here is the breakdown for counting the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) - No triangle formed as 8 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) - No triangle formed as 8 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) - No triangle formed as 8 and 11 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 12) - No triangle formed as 8 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (8, 5) - No triangle formed as 8 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (14, 7) - No triangle formed as 14 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (14, 12) - <0, 14, 12>.
    * Pair 8: (14, 5) - No triangle formed as 14 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (7, 12) - No triangle formed as 7 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. 3 and 11 are already smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) - No triangle formed as 3 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) - No triangle formed as 3 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) - No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (10, 13) - No triangle formed as 10 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (10, 9) - No triangle formed as 10 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (13, 9) - No triangle formed as 13 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. 12 and 13 are already smaller.
    * Pair 1: (12, 6) - <2, 12, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) - No triangle formed as 7 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) - No triangle formed as 7 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pair with smaller node 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 6) - <3, 11, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) - No triangle formed as 11 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) - <3, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) - No triangle formed as 6 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10:
    * Skip as these have smaller nodes to form triangles with.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes 8, 0, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 0) - No triangle formed as 3 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (2, 0) - No triangle formed as 2 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) - No triangle formed as 2 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) - No triangle formed as 2 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 0) - No triangle formed as 4 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 14) - No triangle formed as 4 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 5) - No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 13 and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 13 or 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
