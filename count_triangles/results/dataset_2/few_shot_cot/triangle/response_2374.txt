Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node in a potential triangle.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (13, 17) shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs involving Node 0 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (9, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (10, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (10, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (12, 19) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * No more pairs involving Node 2 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (4, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs involving Node 3 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs involving Node 4 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 4 as it is smaller.
    * No more pairs involving Node 5 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * No more pairs involving Node 6 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * No more pairs involving Node 7 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * No more pairs involving Node 8 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * No more pairs involving Node 9 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
