Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Triangle found: <0, 6, 9>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Triangle found: <2, 9, 14>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> Directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 2) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (14, 11) -> Not directly connected, no triangle.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 10:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 11:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 12:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 14:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
