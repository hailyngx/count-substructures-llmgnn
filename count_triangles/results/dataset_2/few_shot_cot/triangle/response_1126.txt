3. Node 2:
   - No triangles formed.

4. Node 3:
   - No triangles formed.

5. Node 4:
   - No triangles formed.

6. Node 5:
   - No triangles formed.

7. Node 6:
   - No triangles formed.

8. Node 7:
   - No triangles formed.

9. Node 8:
   - No triangles formed.

10. Node 9:
   - No triangles formed.

11. Node 10:
   - No triangles formed.

12. Node 11:
   - No triangles formed.

13. Node 12:
   - No triangles formed.

14. Node 13:
   - No triangles formed.

15. Node 14:
   - No triangles formed.

16. Node 15:
   - No triangles formed.

17. Node 16:
   - No triangles formed.

18. Node 17:
   - No triangles formed.

19. Node 18:
   - No triangles formed.

20. Node 19:
   - No triangles formed.

Calculating the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles from each node:

Total triangles in the graph = 0 triangles

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
