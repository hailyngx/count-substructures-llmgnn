* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: Skipped (with Node 7)
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> Both 0 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 17.

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph.
