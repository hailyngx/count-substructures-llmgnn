Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as mentioned in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 14 are directly connected as (2, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 13 are also connected as (5, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 13 are also connected as (3, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 13 are also connected as (2, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 10 are also connected as (5, 10) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

... Continue this process for Nodes 5 to 14.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 10

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles are: 
<1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 5, 13>, <2, 3, 13>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 10>, <8, 2, 14>, <9, 1, 3>, <9, 3, 12>, <13, 1, 5>

So, the final answer is [10].
