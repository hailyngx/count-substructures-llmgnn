Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (21, 2) -> Triangle with Node 0 formed: <0, 21, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (21, 12) -> Nodes 21 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 20) -> Nodes 4 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 21) -> Triangle with Node 2 formed: <0, 21, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 12) -> Nodes 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 20) -> Nodes 6 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (28, 2) -> Triangle with Node 4 formed: <2, 28, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 20) -> Triangle with Node 4 formed: <1, 20, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (23, 18) -> Nodes 23 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (24, 26) -> Triangle with Node 6 formed: <24, 26, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (16, 4) -> Triangle with Node 7 formed: <4, 16, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> Nodes 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (18, 21) -> Nodes 18 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 8, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> Triangle with Node 9 formed: <7, 18, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> Nodes 3 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (16, 7) -> Triangle with Node 11 formed: <7, 16, 11>.
    * Pair 2: (13, 29) -> Nodes 13 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 11, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (19, 0) -> Nodes 19 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 12, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: 
<0, 21, 2>, <4, 16, 7>, <7, 18, 9>, <2, 28, 4>, <1, 20, 4>, <24, 26, 6>, <7, 16, 11>, <6, 20, 3>, <4, 15, 6>, <0, 2, 21>.

Therefore, the answer is [10].
