Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the graph provided, here are the counts of triangles formed by each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (22, 14) -> Triangle with node 14 formed. <0, 14, 22>
    * Pair 2: (22, 23) -> No third node connected to 23 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (22, 13) -> Triangle with node 13 formed. <0, 13, 22>
    * Pair 4: (14, 23) -> No third node connected to 23 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (14, 13) -> No third node connected to 13 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (23, 13) -> No third node connected to 23 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 20) -> No third node connected to 20 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (15, 10) -> No third node connected to 10 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (15, 9) -> No third node connected to 9 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (20, 10) -> Triangle with node 15 formed. <1, 10, 15>
    * Pair 5: (20, 9) -> No third node connected to 9 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (10, 9) -> No third node connected to 9 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (25, 19) -> No third node connected to 19 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (25, 7) -> No third node connected to 7 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (19, 7) -> No third node connected to 19 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> No third node connected to 10 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> No third node connected to 5 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (10, 5) -> No third node connected to 5 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (14, X) - Triangle with node 0 formed. <0, 6, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 29) - Triangle with node 7 formed. <5, 7, 29>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (24, 12) - No third node connected to 12 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (25, 19) -> No third node connected to 19 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (18, 28) -> Triangle with node 8 formed. <8, 11, 28>
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12 to Node 30:
    * Skipped because they are not connected to at least 2 other nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
[<0, 14, 22>, <1, 10, 15>, <0, 6, 14>, <5, 7, 29>, <8, 11, 28>]
