Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 2, 8>

Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 8) -> 13 and 8 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 8, 13>
    * No other pairs to consider.

Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider.

Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider.

Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 8, 13>
    * No other pairs to consider.

Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: <5, 12, 14>
    * No other pairs to consider.

Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 6.
    * No pairs to consider.

Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 14), but since 3 and 14 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.

Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
