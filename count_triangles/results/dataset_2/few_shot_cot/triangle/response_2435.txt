Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same step-by-step approach as shown in the example:

1. Start with each node and consider all possible triangles it can form:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    
    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

    * Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 do not form any triangles with 2-hop neighbors.

2. Calculate the total number of triangles:
    Total triangles in the graph are [3].

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
