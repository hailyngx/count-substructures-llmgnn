Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, I will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 11) -> 17 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 3: (17, 2) -> 17 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 4: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 or 2 as they are smaller. No other pairs to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * These nodes have fewer than 2 nodes with higher numbers to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node: 0 for each.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5-19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [3].
