* Node 5:
  * No triangles possible as it has less than 2 neighbors.

* Node 6:
  * No triangles possible as it has less than 2 neighbors.

* Node 7:
  * No triangles possible as it has less than 2 neighbors.

  * Pair 2: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 17, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 17, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 18:
  * No triangles possible as it has less than 2 neighbors.

* Node 19:
  * No triangles possible as it has less than 2 neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6 to 19) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
