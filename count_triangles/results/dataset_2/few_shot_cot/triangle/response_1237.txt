Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <5, 7, 0>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <5, 7, 1>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <5, 8, 1>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 6) -> Triangle formed: <7, 6, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed: <5, 9, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <5, 7, 3>.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node as all its 1-hop neighbors have already been checked.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node as all its 1-hop neighbors have already been checked.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node as all its 1-hop neighbors have already been checked.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node as all its 1-hop neighbors have already been checked.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node as all its 1-hop neighbors have already been checked.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
