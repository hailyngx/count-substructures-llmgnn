Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2)

Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 2 are not connected as there is no edge (8, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 7 are not connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 7 are not connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Not connected to any other nodes. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1, 2, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9 are skipped because they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
