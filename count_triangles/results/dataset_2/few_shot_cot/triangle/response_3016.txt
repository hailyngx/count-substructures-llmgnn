Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
[<0, 15, 19>, <2, 4, 16>, <3, 7, 16, 8>, <5, 8, 18>, <6, 12, 15>, <9, 13, 18>]
