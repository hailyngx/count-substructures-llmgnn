    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 18: <0, 7, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 19: <6, 11, 13>

Summing up the total number of triangles for each node, we get:
[1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 20]

Therefore, there are 20 triangles in the given graph.
