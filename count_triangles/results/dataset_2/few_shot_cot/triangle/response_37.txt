Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (2, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (6, 13). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    - No additional triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (11, 14). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (6, 14). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No additional triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
    - No additional triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (1, 13). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 10.
    - No additional triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 6.
    - No additional triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No additional triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are also connected as (0, 13). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 1.
    - No additional triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 10.
    - No additional triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 3.
    - No additional triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 11) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
