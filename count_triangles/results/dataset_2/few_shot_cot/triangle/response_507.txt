Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, here is how you can count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (7, 12) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (7, 19) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 3: (7, 23) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 4: (12, 21) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 5: (12, 29) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 6: (14, 25) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 7: (6, 15) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 8: (6, 28) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 9: (6, 23) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (16, 17) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (16, 9) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 3: (19, 13) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 4: (19, 7) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (13, 26) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (13, 17) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 3: (18, 20) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 4: (18, 13) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 5: (3, 12) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
	    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 4 - Node 8:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 to Node 8 as the smallest numbered nodes.

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (1, 16) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 10:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 11:
        * Pair 1: (2, 12) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (2, 23) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 12:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 13:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 14 - Node 18:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 to Node 18 as the smallest numbered nodes.

    * Node 19:
        * Pair 1: (7, 0) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (7, 23) - No triangle formed as these nodes are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 20 - Node 27:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 20 to Node 27 as the smallest numbered nodes.

    * Node 28:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 29:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 0

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [0].
