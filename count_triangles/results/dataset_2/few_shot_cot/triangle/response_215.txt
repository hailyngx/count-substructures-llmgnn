Response:
Following the same process as in the example given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 9) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
