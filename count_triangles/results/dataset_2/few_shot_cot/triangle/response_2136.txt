Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> Directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> Directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> Directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 have lower node numbers.

4. Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 have lower node numbers.

5. Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 4 have lower node numbers.

6. Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes 0, 1, or 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Directly connected, but 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Directly connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 5. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 6 have lower node numbers.

8. Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 7 have lower node numbers.

9. Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 8 have lower node numbers.

10. Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 9 have lower node numbers.

11. Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 10 have lower node numbers.

12. Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 11 have lower node numbers.

13. Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 12 have lower node numbers.

14. Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 13 have lower node numbers.

15. Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 14 have lower node numbers.

16. Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 15 have lower node numbers.

17. Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 16 have lower node numbers.

18. Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 17 have lower node numbers.

19. Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 18 have lower node numbers.

20. Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 19 have lower node numbers.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
