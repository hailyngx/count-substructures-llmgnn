    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (14, 6) -> Both 14 and 6 are directly connected to Node 9. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> Both 16 and 19 are directly connected to Node 11. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 + 1 (Node 6) + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 9) + 0 + 1 (Node 11) + 0 + 1 (Node 13) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [6].
