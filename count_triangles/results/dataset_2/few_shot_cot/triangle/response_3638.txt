Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (18, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (18, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (17, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (18, 11) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 16) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (17, 15) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 11) - No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Some nodes don't form triangles, so I will continue counting for the nodes that do.
