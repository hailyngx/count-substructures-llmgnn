Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) - Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) - Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) - Both 4 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) - Both 4 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) - Both 10 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (10, 14) - Both 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * No new triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * No new triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) - Both 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 16) - Both 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) - Both 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 17) - Both 12 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Potential triangle.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) - Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Potential triangle.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) - Both 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 10:
    * No new triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than 10.

* Node 11:
    * No new triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than 11.

* Node 12:
    * No new triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than 12.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (17, 16) - Both 17 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are connected. Potential triangle.

* Node 14:
    * No new triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than 14.

* Node 15:
    * No new triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than 15.

* Node 16:
    * No new triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than 16.

* Node 17:
    * No new triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than 17.

* Node 18:
    * No new triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than 18.

* Node 19:
    * No new triangles can be formed with nodes smaller than 19.

Now, let's count the total number of triangles by adding up the potential triangles found for each node: [ <4, 2, 1>, <10, 19, 3>, <9, 18, 6>, <12, 17, 7>, <13, 14, 8>, <5, 2, 9> ]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
