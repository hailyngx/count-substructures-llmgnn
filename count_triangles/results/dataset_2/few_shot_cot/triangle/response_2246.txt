Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 4) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.

    * Pair 15: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 16: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> Triangle formed: <1, 6, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> Triangle formed: <1, 6, 2>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> Triangle formed: <1, 6, 4>.
    * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (2, 0) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (4, 0) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> Triangle formed: <2, 6, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 0) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 0) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> Triangle formed: <3, 6, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> Triangle formed: <3, 6, 1>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 0) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (8, 0) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 0) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 only have one triangle each due to the lack of more than two higher-numbered nodes to form additional triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
