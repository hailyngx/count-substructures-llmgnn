Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 as the third node. <0, 4, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the third node. <1, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 as the third node. <1, 7, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 as the third node. <1, 4, 2>
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 as the third node. <2, 6, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 as the third node. <3, 9, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the third node. <1, 4, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 as the third node. <5, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 as the third node. <7, 9, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
