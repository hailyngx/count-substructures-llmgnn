Response:
Following the process described above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (5, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (0, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (0, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (9, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (9, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (9, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (5, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles: 
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
