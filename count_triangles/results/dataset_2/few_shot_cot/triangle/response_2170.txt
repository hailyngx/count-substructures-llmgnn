Response:
Following the same process as before, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 11: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 7

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 6 (Node 1) + 7 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 18

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.
