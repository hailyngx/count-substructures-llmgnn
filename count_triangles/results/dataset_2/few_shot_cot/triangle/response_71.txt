Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> 0 and 15 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 22) -> 0 and 22 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 24) -> 0 and 24 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 25) -> 0 and 25 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 27) -> 1 and 27 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 29) -> 1 and 29 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 20) -> 3 and 20 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 21) -> 3 and 21 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 24) -> 3 and 24 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 27) -> 3 and 27 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 23) -> 4 and 23 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 29) -> 4 and 29 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 26) -> 5 and 26 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 27) -> 5 and 27 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 26) -> 6 and 26 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 25) -> 8 and 25 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 9) -> 10 and 9 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 21) -> 10 and 21 are directly connected based on the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* For the rest of the nodes, we skip calculating triangles as they are not part of any triplet.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [4].
