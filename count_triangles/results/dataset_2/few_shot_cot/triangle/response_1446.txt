Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are **0 triangles in the given graph**. 

So, the answer is **[0]**.
