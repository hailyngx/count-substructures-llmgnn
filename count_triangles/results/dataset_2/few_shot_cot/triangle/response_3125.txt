Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (15, 8) -> 15 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.

        * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 18:
        * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 19:
        * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph. 
So, the answer is [1].
