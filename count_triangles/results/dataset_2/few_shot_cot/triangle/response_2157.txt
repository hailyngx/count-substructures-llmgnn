    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [14].
