Response:
Following the example provided, we will identify the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Nodes 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 5). Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> Nodes 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 6). Triangle formed: <0, 6, 4>.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> Nodes 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 9). Triangle formed: <0, 9, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Nodes 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (0, 5). Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Nodes 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (3, 9). Triangle formed: <2, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Nodes 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 9). Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 8). Triangle formed: <3, 8, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3). No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (3, 8). Triangle formed: <8, 3, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2). No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
