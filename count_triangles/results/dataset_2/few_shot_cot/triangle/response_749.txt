Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 13 are directly connected as (7, 0) and (0, 13) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 8) -> 16 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 16 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (16, 13) -> 16 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 12 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 12 and 19 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 3) -> 12 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 12 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * Similar to Node 4, these nodes do not have triangles formed with other larger nodes.

The process continues with Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and is complete.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
