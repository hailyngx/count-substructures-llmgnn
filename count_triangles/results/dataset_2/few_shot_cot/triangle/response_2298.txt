Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (15, 16) -> Triangle formed with node 23: <15, 16, 23>
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - No triangle can be formed.

3. Node 2:
    - Not connected to any other nodes.

4. Node 3:
    - No triangle can be formed.

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (13, 23) -> Triangle formed with node 29: <13, 23, 29>
    - Pair 2: (4, 19)  -> Triangle formed with node 23: <4, 19, 23>
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. Node 5:
    - No triangle can be formed.

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Triangle formed with node 27: <11, 14, 27>
    - Pair 2: (6, 7)  -> Triangle formed with node 19: <6, 7, 19>
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

8. Node 7:
    - No triangle can be formed.

9. Node 8:
    - No triangle can be formed.

10. Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (9, 17) -> Triangle formed with node 21: <9, 17, 21>
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. Node 10:
    - No triangle can be formed.

12. Node 11:
    - No additional triangle can be formed.

13. Node 12:
    - No triangle can be formed.

14. Node 13:
    - No triangle can be formed.

15. Node 14:
    - No additional triangle can be formed.

16. Node 15:
    - No triangle can be formed.

17. Node 16:
    - No additional triangle can be formed.

18. Node 17:
    - Pair 1: (17, 27) -> Triangle formed with node 21: <17, 27, 21>
    - No additional triangle can be formed.

19. Node 18:
    - No additional triangle can be formed.

20. Node 19:
    - Pair 1: (19, 27) -> Triangle formed with node 6: <19, 27, 6>
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

21. Node 20:
    - No triangle can be formed.

22. Node 21:
    - No additional triangle can be formed.

23. Node 22:
    - No triangle can be formed.

24. Node 23:
    - No additional triangle can be formed.

25. Node 24:
    - No triangle can be formed.

26. Node 25:
    - No additional triangle can be formed.

27. Node 26:
    - No triangle can be formed.

28. Node 27:
    - No additional triangle can be formed.

29. Node 28:
    - No triangle can be formed.

30. Node 29:
    - No additional triangle can be formed.

Calculating the total number of triangles: 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 19) = 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
