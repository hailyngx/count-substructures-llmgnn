Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided earlier, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> Both 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> Both 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> Both 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Not connected to any other nodes. No triangles possible.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> Both 8 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> Both 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> Both 9 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> Both 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Nodes 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [6]
