Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> Both 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (1, 15) in the list. Checking for the third node:
        * (15, 4) -> 15 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with 1 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (1, 4) in the list. Checking for the third node:
        * (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with 1 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving Node 0 and Node 1 are skipped as they are smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 5) in the list. Checking for the third node:
        * (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with 2 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (9, 15) in the list. Checking for the third node:
        * (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (15, 17) in the list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pairs involving Node 0, 1, and 2 are skipped as they are smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (4, 13) in the list. Checking for the third node:
        * (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (13, 18) in the list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 are skipped as they are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes will provide the total number of triangles in the graph.
