Response:
Following the same process as in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 1). 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 6). 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 9).
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (0, 3). 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:  
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (9, 6).
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (9, 2).
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (9, 4).
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (7, 2).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (4, 0).
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (7, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) = 10.

The unique triangles are:  
<0, 1, 6>  
<0, 3, 4>  
<4, 7, 8>  
<5, 9, 6>  
<5, 9, 4>  
<5, 9, 2>
