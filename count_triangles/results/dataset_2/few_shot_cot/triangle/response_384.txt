Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, here are the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (18, 21) -> Triangle formed with Node 21
    * Pair 2: (18, 22) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (21, 22) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 21) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (15, 22) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (21, 22) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (7, 24) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (7, 29) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (17, 24) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 27) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (13, 27) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 25
    * Pair 2: (4, 28) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (4, 25) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (9, 28) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (5, 24) -> Triangle formed with Node 16
    * Pair 3: (13, 24) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (6, 23) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (7, 24) -> Triangle formed with Node 16
    * Pair 3: (7, 29) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (17, 24) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 29) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 25) -> Triangle formed with Node 4
    * Pair 2: (9, 28) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Some nodes have been omitted as they do not form any triangles with nodes greater than them. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
