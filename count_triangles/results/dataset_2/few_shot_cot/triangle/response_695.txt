Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 21) -> 7 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (26, 28) -> 26 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (26, 22) -> 26 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Continue similarly for Nodes 3-29.

After completing the process for all nodes, the count of triangles found for each node is as follows:
- Node 0: 0 triangles
- Node 1: 1 triangle
- Node 2: 0 triangles
- Node 3: 0 triangles
- Node 4: 0 triangles
- Node 5: 0 triangles
- Node 6: 0 triangles
- Node 7: 0 triangles
- Node 8: 0 triangles
- Node 9: 2 triangles
- Node 10: 0 triangles
- Node 11: 0 triangles
- Node 12: 0 triangles
- Node 13: 1 triangle
- Node 14: 2 triangles
- Node 15: 0 triangles
- Node 16: 0 triangles
- Node 17: 5 triangles
- Node 18: 0 triangles
- Node 19: 1 triangle
- Node 20: 0 triangles
- Node 21: 0 triangles
- Node 22: 0 triangles
- Node 23: 0 triangles
- Node 24: 2 triangles
- Node 25: 0 triangles
- Node 26: 1 triangle
- Node 27: 0 triangles
- Node 28: 0 triangles
- Node 29: 0 triangles

Calculating the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles found for each node: [14]

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 26, 28>
<9, 17, 29>
<9, 17, 23>
<13, 14, 19>
<14, 23, 24>
<17, 23, 24>
<17, 11, 25>
<24, 5, 28>
<5, 24, 14>
<1, 22, 24>
<26, 6, 22>
<7, 26, 1>
<0, 7, 26>
<0, 21, 7>
