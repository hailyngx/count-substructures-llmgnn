Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (17, 26) -> 17 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 29) -> 17 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 29) -> 26 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<14, 17, 26>, <14, 26, 29>)

* Node 15:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (22, 16) -> 22 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 9) -> 22 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 9) -> 16 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<16, 22, 16>, <16, 16, 9>)

* Node 17:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26:
    * Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 27:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 28:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 29:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 14) + 2 (Node 16) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
