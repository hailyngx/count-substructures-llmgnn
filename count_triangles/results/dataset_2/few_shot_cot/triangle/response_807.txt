Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided for the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (8, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 26) -> 8 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (8, 0, 26) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (14, 26) -> 14 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (0, 26, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 10 to 29 are all part of triangles with larger nodes, so no more triangles can be formed with them as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0)
Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
