Response:
Following the step-by-step guide provided for the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Skipped, as there are no triangles involving Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * <1, 11, 14> - Triangle formed with nodes 1, 11, and 14.
    * <1, 11, 2> - Triangle formed with nodes 1, 11, and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * <2, 11, 4> - Triangle formed with nodes 2, 11, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skipped, as there are no triangles involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * <4, 6, 8> - Triangle formed with nodes 4, 6, and 8.
    * <4, 5, 2> - Triangle formed with nodes 4, 5, and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skipped, as there are no triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skipped, as we already counted triangles involving Node 4 (which is smaller than 6).

* Node 7:
    * <7, 8, 18> - Triangle formed with nodes 7, 8, and 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skipped, as we already counted triangles involving Node 4 and 7 (which are smaller than 8).

* Node 9:
    * Skipped, as there are no triangles involving Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skipped, as there are no triangles involving Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * <11, 14, 15> - Triangle formed with nodes 11, 14, and 15.
    * <11, 16, 9> - Triangle formed with nodes 11, 16, and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 12:
    * Skipped, as there are no triangles involving Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * Skipped, as there are no triangles involving Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * Skipped, as we already counted triangles involving Node 1 and 11 (which are smaller than 14).

* Node 15:
    * Skipped, as we already counted triangles involving Node 7 and 11 (which are smaller than 15).

* Node 16:
    * <16, 18, 15> - Triangle formed with nodes 16, 18, and 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Skipped, as there are no triangles involving Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * Skipped, as we already counted triangles involving Node 7 and 16 (which are smaller than 18).

* Node 19:
    * Skipped, as there are no triangles involving Node 19.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 16) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9 triangles] in the given graph.
