Response:
Following the step-by-step process as demonstrated in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 28) - No triangle formed as 1 and 28 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) - No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (1, 27) - No triangle formed as 1 and 27 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 4: (4, 27) - No triangle formed as 4 and 27 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    - Pair 1: (7, 28) - No triangle formed as 7 and 28 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (7, 14) - No triangle formed as 7 and 14 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (12, 22) - No triangle formed as 12 and 22 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (17, 24) - No triangle formed as 17 and 24 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (9, 26) - No triangle formed as 9 and 26 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (10, 21) - No triangle formed as 10 and 21 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip all pairs as all other nodes are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (10, 21) - No triangle formed as 10 and 21 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16:
    - No triangle can be formed with any combination of these nodes since there are no nodes greater than these nodes.

- Node 17:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 17.
    - Pair 1: (17, 18) - No triangle formed as 17 and 18 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 18:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 17 as they are smaller than 18.
    - Pair 1: (18, 25) - No triangle formed as 18 and 25 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    - No triangle can be formed with any combination of these nodes since there are no nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph. 

The final answer is [0].
