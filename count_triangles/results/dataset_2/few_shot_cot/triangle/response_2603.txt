Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, I will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 3) -> Skip, as Node 3 is smaller than Node 13.
    * Pair 2: (13, 8) -> 13 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (13, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (4, 3).
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (4, 2) and (2, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> Both 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (7, 4).
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (7, 14) and (2, 14).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as (5, 8).
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are also connected as (5, 12).
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> Skip, as Node 10 is smaller than Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <8, 13, 3>, <5, 9, 8>, <5, 11, 12>, <5, 12, 11>, <4, 6, 2>, <13, 3, 7>. 

So, the final answer is [6].
