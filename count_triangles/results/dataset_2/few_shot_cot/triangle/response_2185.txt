Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - <6, 8, 0>: Directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1**:
    - <6, 1, 8>: Directly connected.
    - <3, 1, 8>: Directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. **Node 2**:
    - <9, 2, 5>: Not directly connected.
    - <7, 2, 4>: Not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3**:
    - <1, 3, 8>: Directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4**:
    - Skip because all potential nodes are smaller than Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5**:
    - Skip because all potential nodes are smaller than Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6**:
    - <9, 6, 1>: Directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. **Node 7**:
    - <3, 7, 8>: Directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. **Node 8**:
    - Skip because all potential nodes are smaller than Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9**:
    - Skip because all potential nodes are smaller than Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles by adding up the triangles from each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6 triangles] in the given graph.
