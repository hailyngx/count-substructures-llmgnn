Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed since 1 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed since 1 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed since 1 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed since 1 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> Triangle formed with node 0, as 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected to each other.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with node 0, as 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected to each other.
    * Pair 7: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 0, as 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected to each other.
    * Pair 8: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 0, as 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes a smaller numbered node.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes a smaller numbered node.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes a smaller numbered node.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes a smaller numbered node.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes a smaller numbered node.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes a smaller numbered node.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes a smaller numbered node.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes a smaller numbered node.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes a smaller numbered node.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0)
[4]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
