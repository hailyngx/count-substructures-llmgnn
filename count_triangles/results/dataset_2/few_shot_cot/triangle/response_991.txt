Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 14) - 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    - Pair 3: (4, 12) - 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.
    - Pair 5: (4, 2) - 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    - Pair 2: (5, 2) - 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) - 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    - Pair 2: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 11) - 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (8, 14) - 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (8, 6) - 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (8, 11) - 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 4) - 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5 or not 1-hop neighbors. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now let's proceed with Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 using the same process.

Towards the end, we will sum up the total triangles from each node to find the final count of triangles in the graph. Let's continue the calculations.
