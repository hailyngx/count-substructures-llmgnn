Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0:
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

2. Node 1:
   - Skipped as all the pairs involve nodes smaller than Node 1.

3. Node 2:
   - Skipped as all the pairs involve nodes smaller than Node 2.

4. Node 3:
   - Skipped as all the pairs involve nodes smaller than Node 3.

5. Node 4:
   - Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (2, 6) - Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 4: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<4, 7, 9>)

6. Node 5:
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. Node 6:
   - Skipped as all the pairs involve nodes smaller than Node 6.

8. Node 7:
   - Pair 1: (9, 13) - Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<7, 9, 13>)

9. Node 8:
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

14. Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) = 2.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
