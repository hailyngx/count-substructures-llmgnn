Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Both 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (9, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (9, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 5) = 3

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
