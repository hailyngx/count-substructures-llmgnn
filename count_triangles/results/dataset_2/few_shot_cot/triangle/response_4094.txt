Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edges list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

[<4, 11, 5>, <3, 11, 14>, <5, 11, 4>, <4, 12, 19>, <12, 19, 1>, <12, 4, 19>]
