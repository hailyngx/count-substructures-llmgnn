Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) - Both 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) - Both 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 19) - Both 18 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 18 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) - Both 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) - Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) - Both 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (18, 28) - Both 18 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 18 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 22) - Both 10 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 10 and 22 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (21, 26) - Both 21 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 21 and 26 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* (Continuing with the same approach for nodes 4 to 29)

* Node 4: 0 triangles
* Node 5: 1 triangle
* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 0 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 2 triangles
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 3 triangles
* Node 21: 2 triangles
* Node 22: 0 triangles
* Node 23: 2 triangles
* Node 24: 2 triangles
* Node 25: 0 triangles
* Node 26: 1 triangle
* Node 27: 1 triangle
* Node 28: 0 triangles
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is: [15].
