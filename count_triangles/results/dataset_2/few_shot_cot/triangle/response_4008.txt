Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step based on each node:

* Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Triangle with nodes (7, 8, 2): All three nodes are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Triangle with nodes (6, 7, 12): All three nodes are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Triangle with nodes (9, 12, 5): All three nodes are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph =  1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
