Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 0) - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 8: (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (2, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 4), but since 5 and 4 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
