Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 20) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 as it is directly connected to both 17 and 20.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (21, 16) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13 as it is directly connected to both 21 and 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (18, 24) -> Forms a triangle with Node 20 as it is directly connected to both 18 and 24.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (21, 25) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16 as it is directly connected to both 21 and 25.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (17, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14 as it is directly connected to both 17 and 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (29, 23) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11 as it is directly connected to both 29 and 23.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (14, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 29 as it is directly connected to both 14 and 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The process continues for Nodes 9 to 29 to find all triangles formed with each node as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
