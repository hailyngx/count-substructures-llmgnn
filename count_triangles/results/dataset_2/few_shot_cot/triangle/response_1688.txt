Response:
Following the process outlined in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (10, 4) -> 10 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and also connected as per the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and also connected as per the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 10:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 11, 12, 13, 14:
        * Skipped as they do not have at least two nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
