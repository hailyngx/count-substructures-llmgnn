Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 7

Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated before, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
