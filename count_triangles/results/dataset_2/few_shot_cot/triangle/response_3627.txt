Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are connected as (3, 4) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 3 are connected as (6, 3) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are connected as (2, 6) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are connected as (3, 6) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 8).
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 9).
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 1).
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (9, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No valid triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No valid triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * No valid triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (4, 9).
    * No other valid triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No valid triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No valid triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: <3, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <4, 7, 2>.
