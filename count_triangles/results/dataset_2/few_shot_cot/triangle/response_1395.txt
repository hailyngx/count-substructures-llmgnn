Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Nodes 11 to 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
