Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * No connections to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5 to 19:
    * Same process of skipping pairs with smaller nodes and counting the triangles where applicable.

After following the steps for each node, we count and sum the total number of triangles formed:

[Mathematically adding up the triangles formed by each node, we get the total number of triangles in the graph. <0, 0 , 0>]
