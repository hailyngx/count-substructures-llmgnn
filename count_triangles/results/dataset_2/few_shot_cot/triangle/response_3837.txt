Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process given in the example, we will find the total number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) in the list, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) in the list, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Not enough nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
