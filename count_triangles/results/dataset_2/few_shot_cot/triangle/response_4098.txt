Response:
Following the same methodology as outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected. Continue checking for the common neighbor.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected. Continue checking for the common neighbor.
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1: 
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are connected. Continue checking for the common neighbor.
    * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles possible as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of node 3, and they are connected. Continue checking for the common neighbor.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of node 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of node 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of node 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Let's continue this process for the remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles.
