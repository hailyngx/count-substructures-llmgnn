Response:
Following the example provided, let's compute the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> Node 3 and 4 are connected. But Node 3 and 4 do not share any common neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Node 2 and 7 are connected. Node 2 and 7 share Node 1 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Node 5 and 8 are connected. Node 5 and 8 share Nodes 1 and 2 as common neighbors. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Node 8 and 9 are connected. But Node 8 and 9 do not share any common neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Node 4 and 6 are connected. Node 4 and 6 share Node 5 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Node 4 and 5 are connected. Node 4 and 5 share Nodes 1 and 6 as common neighbors. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Node 5 and 6 are connected. Node 5 and 6 share Nodes 4 and 8 as common neighbors. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Node 5 and 8 are connected. Node 5 and 8 share Nodes 1 and 2 as common neighbors. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, respectively.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
