Response:
Following the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 7, 2>, <5, 6, 4>]
