Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 18 are also connected. Triangle (0, 3, 18) formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle (0, 18, 19) formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle (1, 5, 12) formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle (3, 4, 11) formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle (3, 4, 14) formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No other triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Continue this process for Nodes 6 through 19 using the provided adjacency list.

8. Sum up the total number of triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node.

The final answer should be within brackets [].
