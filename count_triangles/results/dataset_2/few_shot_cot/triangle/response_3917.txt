Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7)

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
