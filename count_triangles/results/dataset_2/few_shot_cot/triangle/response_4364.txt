Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's possible triangles step by step:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 due to the lack of at least two additional connected nodes.

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 due to the lack of at least two additional connected nodes.

* Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 due to the lack of at least two additional connected nodes.

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 12) -> Both 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 due to the lack of at least two additional connected nodes.

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 due to the lack of at least two additional connected nodes.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Both 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 due to the lack of at least two additional connected nodes.

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Both 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 8, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Both 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Both 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 due to the lack of at least two additional connected nodes.

* Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 due to the lack of at least two additional connected nodes.

* Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 due to the lack of at least two additional connected nodes.

* Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 due to the lack of at least two additional connected nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 8) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
