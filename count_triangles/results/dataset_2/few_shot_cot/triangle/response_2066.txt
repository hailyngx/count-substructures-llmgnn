Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, we will now find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.

    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.

    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
