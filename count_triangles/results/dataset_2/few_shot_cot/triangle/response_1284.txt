Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected because (3, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 11 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
