Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 (1-hop neighbor) and 6 (1-hop neighbor) are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No direct edge between 7 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> No direct edge between 7 and 12. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> No direct edge between 7 and 14. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> Nodes 5 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Nodes 4 and 11 are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * No eligible pairs larger than Node 4 to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Nodes 6 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> Nodes 6 and 12 are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * No eligible pairs larger than Node 6 to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * No eligible pairs larger than Node 7 to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * No eligible pairs larger than Node 8 to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * No eligible pairs larger than Node 9 to form triangles.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Nodes 12 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 11:
    * No eligible pairs larger than Node 11 to form triangles.

* Node 12:
    * No eligible pairs larger than Node 12 to form triangles.

* Node 13:
    * No eligible pairs larger than Node 13 to form triangles.

* Node 14:
    * No eligible pairs larger than Node 14 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
