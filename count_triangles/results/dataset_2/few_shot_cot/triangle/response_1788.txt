Response:
Following the same process as described in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (7, 0, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (8, 11) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (8, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (9, 2, 4) in the list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (9, 6) in the list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (9, 8) in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (5, 7, 11) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as (13, 14) in the edge list.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as (13, 6, 9) in the edge list.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
  
* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are also connected as (13, 14) in the edge list.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
