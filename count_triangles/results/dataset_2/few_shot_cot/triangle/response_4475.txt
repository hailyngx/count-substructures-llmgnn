Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 23) -> 17 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 2: (17, 29) -> 17 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 3: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node since it has been covered in previous steps. Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Similar to Node 4, no additional triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles for each node: 0

Continuing with Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 10. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12, 13, and 14:
    * Similar to the previous nodes, no additional triangles are formed. Total triangles with Node 12, 13, and 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Moving on to Nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:

* Node 15:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (19, 21) -> 19 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17, 18, and 19:
    * No new triangles can be formed. Total triangles with Node 17, 18, and 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now considering Nodes 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24:

* Node 20:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 21:
    * Pair 1: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 21, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 22, 23, and 24:
    * No new triangles can be formed. Total triangles with Node 22, 23, and 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing with Nodes 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:

* Node 25:
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 25, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 26:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 27, 28, and 29:
    * No new triangles can be formed. Total triangles with Node 27, 28, and 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
