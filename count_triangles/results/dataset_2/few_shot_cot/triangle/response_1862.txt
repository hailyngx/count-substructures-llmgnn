Response:
Let's go through each node step by step to count the triangles in the graph:

- Node 0:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 1:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6, 7 are connected via (6, 7) and 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7, 9 are connected via (7, 9) and 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4, 14 are connected via (4, 14) but are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle is formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6, 7 are connected via (6, 2, 7) but are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle is formed.
  - Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3, 14 are connected via (3, 5, 14) and 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
  - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
