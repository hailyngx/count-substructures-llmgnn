Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (8, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (14, 4) -> 14 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (14, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (9, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles for Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles for Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles for Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles for Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles for Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles for Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
