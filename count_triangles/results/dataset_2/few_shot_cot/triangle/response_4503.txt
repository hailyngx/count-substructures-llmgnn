Response:
Following the instructions given in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.

Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Next, we will continue with Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
