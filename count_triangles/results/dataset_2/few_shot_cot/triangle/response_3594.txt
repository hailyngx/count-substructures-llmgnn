Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> Connected to 2 and 15 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 1) -> Nodes 2 and 1 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 19) -> Connected to 2 and 19 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (15, 1) -> Nodes 15 and 1 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (15, 19) -> Connected to 15 and 19 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Connected to 0 and 6 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 16) -> Nodes 0 and 16 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 16) -> Connected to 6 and 16 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> Nodes 8 and 13 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Connected to 8 and 9 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 17) -> Connected to 8 and 17 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) -> Connected to 0 and 9 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 13) -> Connected to 0 and 13 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 13) -> Connected to 9 and 13 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip as there are not enough connected nodes for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> Connected to 13 and 15 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 17) -> Connected to 13 and 17 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 17) -> Connected to 15 and 17 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are not enough connected nodes for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 16) -> Connected to 1 and 16 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 17) -> Nodes 1 and 17 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 17) -> Connected to 16 and 17 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Connected to 9 and 14 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 17) -> Connected to 9 and 17 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 17) -> Connected to 14 and 17 directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Node 2, as Node 2 is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that have both nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * Skipped because they do not have enough connected nodes for forming triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 17.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
