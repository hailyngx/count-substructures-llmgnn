Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:
        
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: No possible triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: No possible triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: <2, 9, 11> -> Nodes 2, 9, and 11 form a triangle as they are all connected to each other directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: <3, 9, 11> -> Nodes 3, 9, and 11 form a triangle as they are all connected to each other directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: No possible triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: No possible triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: <5, 9, 13> -> Nodes 5, 9, and 13 form a triangle as they are all connected to each other directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: No possible triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: No possible triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: No possible triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: No possible triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: No possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: No possible triangle with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: <11, 12, 14> -> Nodes 11, 12, and 14 form a triangle as they are all connected to each other directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: No possible triangle with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: No possible triangle with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: No possible triangle with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
