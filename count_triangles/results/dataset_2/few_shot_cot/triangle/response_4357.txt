Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 29) -> 9 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 29 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs with Node 0 can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 4) -> 12 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (12, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 20) -> 12 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs with Node 1 can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (9, 11) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs with Node 2 can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs with Node 3 and a larger numbered node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (11, 27) -> 11 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (11, 27) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (11, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 27) -> 4 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (4, 27) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (4, 14) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs with Node 4 can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

Summarizing the number of triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 1 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 1 (Node 29) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
