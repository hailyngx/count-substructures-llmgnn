Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. 
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> Connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 3: (9, 19) -> Connected, but not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 14) -> Connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> Connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> Not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Not connected, so no triangle.
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> Connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) -> Not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not connected, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) -> Connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> Not connected, so no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> Connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> Not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (13, 1) -> Connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 5.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> Not connected, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 11, 10: Skipped as there are no eligible pairs to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (15, 6) -> Connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 9.
    * Pair 2: (15, 16) -> Not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 12, 13, 14: Skipped due to the absence of valid pairs to consider.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (16, 6) -> Not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (18, 1) -> Connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 16.
    * Pair 2: (18, 3) -> Connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 16.
    * Pair 3: (18, 14) -> Connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 16.
    * Pair 4: (18, 13) -> Connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 16.
    * Pair 5: (18, 19) -> Not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Nodes 17, 18, and 19: Skipped due to the absence of valid pairs to consider.

Summarizing the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 15) + 4 (Node 16) = 13

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
