Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, I will count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step. 

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are connected to node 0, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (16, 25) -> 16 and 25 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (16, 2) -> There is no direct edge between 16 and 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (16, 22) -> There is no direct edge between 16 and 22. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (25, 2) -> There is a direct edge between 25 and 2 as (25, 2). Not forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (15, 3) -> There is a direct edge between 15 and 3 as (15, 3). Not forming a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (15, 27) -> There is a direct edge between 15 and 27 as (15, 27). Not forming a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (15, 2) -> There is a direct edge between 15 and 2 as (15, 2). Not forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (12, 29) -> There is a direct edge between 12 and 29 as (12, 29). Not forming a triangle.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

11. Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10.

12. Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

13. Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> There is a direct edge between 4 and 7 as (4, 7). Not forming a triangle.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

14. Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

16. Node 15:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

17. Node 16:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

18. Node 17:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

19. Node 18:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

20. Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

21. Node 20:

26. Node 25:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node.

27. Node 26:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node.

28. Node 27:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node.

29. Node 28:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

30. Node 29:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summing up all the triangles found in each node, I found a total of [0] triangles in the given graph.
