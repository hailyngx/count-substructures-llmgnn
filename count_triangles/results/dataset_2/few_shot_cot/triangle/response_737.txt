Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 9 to 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.
