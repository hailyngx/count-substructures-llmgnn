Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * <0, 3, 6> - 0, 3, and 6 are all connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * <3, 6, 7> - 3, 6, and 7 are all connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * <6, 7, 0> - 6, 7, and 0 are all connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
