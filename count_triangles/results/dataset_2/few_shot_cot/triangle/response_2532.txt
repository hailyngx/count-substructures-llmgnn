Response:
Let's compute the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node one by one:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 9) - Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (2, 12) - Both 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (7, 12) - Both 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (9, 12) - Both 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
  * Only 2 triangles can be formed where Node 1 is the smallest numbered node: (1, 8, 5) and (1, 8, 12)
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
  * Skipped because all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than Node 2.

* Node 3:
  * Only 1 triangle can be formed where Node 3 is the smallest numbered node: (3, 8, 12)
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * No triangles can be formed where Node 4 is the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * No triangles can be formed where Node 5 is the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * No triangles can be formed where Node 6 is the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
  * No triangles can be formed where Node 7 is the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  * No triangles can be formed where Node 8 is the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  * No triangles can be formed where Node 9 is the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
  * No triangles can be formed where Node 10 is the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
  * No triangles can be formed where Node 11 is the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
  * No triangles can be formed where Node 12 is the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
  * No triangles can be formed where Node 13 is the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
  * No triangles can be formed where Node 14 is the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
