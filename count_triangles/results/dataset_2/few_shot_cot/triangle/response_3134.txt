Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> Connected directly and both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 18) -> Connected directly, but not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 18) -> Connected directly, but not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Connected directly and both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 15) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Connected directly and both 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> Connected directly and both 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Connected directly and both 1-hop neighbors of 5. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> Connected directly, but not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> Connected directly, but not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (12, 9) -> Connected directly and both 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> Connected directly and both 1-hop neighbors of 9. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Connected directly and both 1-hop neighbors of 10. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 18) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (12, 5) -> Connected directly and both 1-hop neighbors of 11. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Connected directly and both 1-hop neighbors of 12. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 18) -> Connected directly, but not 1-hop neighbors of 12. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> Connected directly and both 1-hop neighbors of 14. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (14, 9) -> Connected directly and both 1-hop neighbors of 15. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 16 to 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
