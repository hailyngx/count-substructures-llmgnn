Response:
Applying the same step-by-step process as outlined in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not connected as there is no edge (5, 10). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected, forming a 1-hop triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not connected as there is no edge (8, 10). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <0, 5, 8>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected, forming a 1-hop triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <1, 9, 12>

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected, forming a 1-hop triangle with Node 2.

    * Unique triangles: <2, 6, 9>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are connected, forming a 1-hop triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are connected, forming a 1-hop triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles: <3, 8, 10>, <3, 10, 14>

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 9.

Therefore, [9] triangles are found in the given graph, and the unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 8>, <1, 9, 12>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 10>, <3, 10, 14>, <6, 9, 14>, <5, 7, 11>, <12, 13, 12>, <6, 11, 14>.
