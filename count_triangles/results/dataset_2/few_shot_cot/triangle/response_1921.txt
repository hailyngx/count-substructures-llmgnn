Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated in the example above, here is the count for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (18, 9) -> 18 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (18, 4) -> 18 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No connections to form any triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> Both 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Remaining pairs do not result in triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Remaining pairs do not result in triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Remaining pairs do not result in triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5 to 19:
    * Following the same process as above, the total triangles with each of the remaining nodes as the smallest numbered node are as follows:
    * Node 5: 0
    * Node 6: 0
    * Node 7: 0
    * Node 8: 0
    * Node 9: 0
    * Node 10: 0
    * Node 11: 0
    * Node 12: 0
    * Node 13: 0
    * Node 14: 0
    * Node 15: 0
    * Node 16: 0
    * Node 17: 0
    * Node 18: 0
    * Node 19: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
