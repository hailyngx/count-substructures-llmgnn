Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 13.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 and Node 13.
    - Pair 2: (9, 15) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 6.
    - Pair 2: (3, 14) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 and Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 17.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11 and Node 17.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 and Node 17.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (16, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16 and Node 17.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - Only connected to Node 9, not enough nodes to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (4, 18) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 18.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 10:
    - Only connected to Node 12, not enough nodes to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (5, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 17.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (18, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 18 and Node 19.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (1, 17) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 17.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 14:
    - Only connected to Node 11 and Node 2, not enough nodes to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 15:
    - Only connected to Node 1, not enough nodes to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 16:
    - Only connected to Node 4 and Node 7, not enough nodes to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 17:
    - Pair 1: (13, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13 and Node 19.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 18:
    - Pair 1: (4, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 19:
    - Only connected to Node 13 and Node 2, not enough nodes to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
