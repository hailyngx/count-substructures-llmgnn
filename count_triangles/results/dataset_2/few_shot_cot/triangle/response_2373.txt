Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 4 are connected as (5, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 2 are connected as (6, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 2 and 8 are connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
