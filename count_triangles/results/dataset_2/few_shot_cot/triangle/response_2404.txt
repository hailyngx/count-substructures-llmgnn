Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
