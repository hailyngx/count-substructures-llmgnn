Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> Nodes 1 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Nodes 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (12, 8) -> Nodes 12 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 for each node.
* So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 0.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [0].
