Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. **Node 0:**
   - <4, 8, 5> is a triangle as all three nodes are connected to each other directly.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. **Node 2:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. **Node 3:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. **Node 4:**
   - <7, 8, 5> is a triangle as all three nodes are connected to each other directly.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. **Node 7:**
   - <4, 8, 5> is a triangle as all three nodes are connected to each other directly.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. **Node 8:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. **Node 9:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. **Node 10:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. **Node 11:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. **Node 12:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

14. **Node 13:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. **Node 14:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
