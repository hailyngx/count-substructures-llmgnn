Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node and the potential triangles they form:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge (2, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 25) -> 2 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge (2, 25) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 25) -> 3 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are indirectly connected via node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge (5, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge (5, 16) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge (5, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (9, 17) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

We have found all the triangles based on the given graph information. Now, let's calculate the total number of unique triangles:

[<5, 9, 1>, <5, 7, 11>, <5, 11, 3>, <9, 7, 11>, <9, 5, 1>, <14, 7, 9>, <14, 27, 13>, <15, 9, 5>, <15, 18, 5>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
