Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 24) -> 13 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 13 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 23) -> 13 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 13 and 23 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (24, 23) -> 24 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 24 and 23 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 28) -> 2 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 28 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 1) -> 18 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 18 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 2 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (20, 26) -> 20 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 20 and 26 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (24, 14) -> 24 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 24 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 24) -> 7 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 24 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 21) -> 13 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 13 and 21 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (21, 1) -> 21 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 21 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (25, 15) -> 25 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 25 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (25, 1) -> 25 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 25 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10 through 29:
    * Skipping the pairs for nodes 10 and above as there are no pairs with at least two nodes greater than 10.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
