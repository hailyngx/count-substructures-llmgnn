Response:
Following the same approach as shown in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 10) -> 11 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving 0 and 1 are skipped as they are smaller than 2.
    * No pairs left to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue the same process for nodes 3 to 29.

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:

* Node 17:
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 20:
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 21:
    * Total triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 22:
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 23:
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 24:
    * Total triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 25:
    * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 26:
    * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 27:
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 28:

* Node 29:
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) + 2 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 1 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [11].
