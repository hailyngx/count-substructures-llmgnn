Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 3, 2, and node 0

Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the same process as before for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * TOTAL triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * TOTAL triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * TOTAL triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * TOTAL triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * TOTAL triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * TOTAL triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
