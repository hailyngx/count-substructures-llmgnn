Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 5: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 5: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * The triangles of Node 3 are already counted as part of other nodes (0, 2, 1).

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * The triangles of Node 5 are already counted as part of other nodes (1, 0, 4).

* Node 6:
    * The triangles of Node 6 are already counted as part of other nodes (1, 2).

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 10), but since 4 and 10 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
