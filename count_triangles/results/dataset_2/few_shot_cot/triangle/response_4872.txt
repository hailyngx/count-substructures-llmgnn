Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example above to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected as (1, 0, 5) and (5, 0, 1). Formed triangle: <0, 1, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) - 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected as (0, 6) shown in the edge list. No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) - 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (7, 1, 5). Formed triangle: <1, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected as (1, 0, 9). No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) - 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 9, 1). Formed triangle: <1, 2, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) - 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) - 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (7, 3, 5). Formed triangle: <3, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) - 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (6, 5, 7). Formed triangle: <5, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
