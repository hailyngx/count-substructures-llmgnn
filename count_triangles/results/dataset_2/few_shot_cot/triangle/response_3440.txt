Node 4 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided with the given information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Skipped since 2 is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 18.

Therefore, there are [18] triangles in the given graph.
