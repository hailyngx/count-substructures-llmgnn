Response:
Following the example provided earlier, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph using each node. 

* Node 0: 
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 12 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 4 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 14 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 3 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 0) -> 12 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have been matched in pairs greater than themselves in the previous calculations. We will move to the next set of nodes.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and 5 and 11 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and 7 and 14 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and 1 and 3 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and 1 and 4 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0*9 (Nodes 1-9, already covered) + 0*5 (Nodes 10-14) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
