Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (17, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (16, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (19, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

- Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

- Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

- Node 12:
    * Triangle formed by Node 1 includes Node 12, so no additional triangles with Node 12.

- Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> Triangle formed with Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 15:
    * Triangle formed by Node 2 includes Node 15, so no additional triangles with Node 15.

- Node 16:
    * Triangle formed by Node 5 includes Node 16, so no additional triangles with Node 16.

- Node 17:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 17.

- Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> Triangle formed with Node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
