Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example above, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph: 

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 13, 14>.
  * Pair 2: (13, 20) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (13, 1) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (14, 20) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (14, 1) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (20, 1) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  * No new triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
  * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  * No new triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 11>.
  * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (4, 18) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (11, 19) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (11, 18) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (19, 18) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  * No new triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  * No new triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  * No new triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> Triangle formed: <1, 7, 14>.
  * Pair 2: (1, 28) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (1, 15) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (14, 28) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (14, 15) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (28, 15) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes...

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [].
