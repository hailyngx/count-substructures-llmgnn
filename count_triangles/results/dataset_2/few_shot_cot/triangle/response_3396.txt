Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 2 are also connected as (0, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 6 are also connected as (0, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 9 are also connected as (0, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 1 are also connected as (0, 1) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 6 are also connected as (1, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 0 are also connected as (1, 0) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are also connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 9 are also connected as (2, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 0 are also connected as (2, 0) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Proceeding in a similar manner for Nodes 6 to 9:
* Node 6: 0
* Node 7: 0
* Node 8: 4
* Node 9: 3

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 4 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 20.

Therefore, there are [20] triangles in the given graph.
