Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 28) -> 17 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 17 and 28 are also connected as (17, 28) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 11) -> 17 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (17, 11) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 29) -> 3 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 29) -> 7 and 29 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (1, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 28) -> 1 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (1, 28) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 28) -> 13 and 28 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 21) -> 7 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as (7, 21) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

Considering the remaining nodes as well, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
