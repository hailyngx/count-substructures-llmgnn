Response:
Following the process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 4) -> 18 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 2) -> 18 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10 to 19: Since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 10 to form triangles, we skip the calculations for these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
