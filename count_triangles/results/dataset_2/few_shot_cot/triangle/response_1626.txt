Response:
Following the step-by-step approach mentioned in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pairs: Skipped any pairs involving nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangle formed as a result of the available pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs: Skipped any pairs involving nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangle formed as a result of the available pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs: Skipped any pairs involving nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangle formed as a result of the available pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs: Skipped any pairs involving nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangle formed as a result of the available pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pairs: Skipped any pairs involving nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (10, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pairs: Skipped any pairs involving nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangle formed as a result of the available pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pairs: Skipped any pairs involving nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangle formed as a result of the available pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pairs: Skipped any pairs involving nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangle formed as a result of the available pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pairs: Skipped any pairs involving nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangle formed as a result of the available pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 4) -> 13 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as (13, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs involving 10 remaining.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs involving 11 remaining.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pairs: Skipped any pairs involving nodes smaller than 12.
    * No triangle formed as a result of the available pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pairs: Skipped any pairs involving nodes smaller than 13.
    * No triangle formed as a result of the available pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pairs: Skipped any pairs involving nodes smaller than 14.
    * No triangle formed as a result of the available pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
