Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) - Both 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 25) - Both 9 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 25) - Both 18 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 18, 25>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (18, 29) - Both 18 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 23) - Both 18 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 27) - Both 18 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 18, 27>.
    * Pair 4: (18, 10) - Both 18 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (29, 23) - Both 29 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (29, 27) - Both 29 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (29, 10) - Both 29 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (23, 27) - Both 23 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (23, 10) - Both 23 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (27, 10) - Both 27 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) - Both 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) - Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 7, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip the pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) - Both 11 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 11, 16>.
    * Pair 2: (11, 22) - Both 11 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 11, 22>.
    * Pair 3: (11, 10) - Both 11 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 22) - Both 16 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (16, 10) - Both 16 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (22, 10) - Both 22 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

After completing the process for all nodes, calculate the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles found for each node.

Therefore, the final answer is to be presented inside brackets [].
