Response:
Following the step-by-step process to find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 14) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 1) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 3) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (7, 5) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (1, 3) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (1, 14) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (3, 14) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 8

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 11) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 14) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 14) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (11, 5) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (14, 5) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 14) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (14, 5) -> Connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 8 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) = 17.

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph.
