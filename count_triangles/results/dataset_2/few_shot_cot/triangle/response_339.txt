Response:
Following the steps outlined in the previous example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph with the provided edges and adjacency list.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 6: <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed with node 4: <0, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with node 0: <0, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with node 0: <0, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 0) -> Triangle formed with node 6: <0, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 5: <3, 4, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> Triangle formed with node 0: <0, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> Triangle formed with nodes 2 and 4: <0, 2, 4> and <0, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 4: (6, 5) -> Triangle formed with node 0: <0, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't any pairs where the nodes are greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
