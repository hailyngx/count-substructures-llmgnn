Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are not connected because (4, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 16 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 16) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 16) -> 1 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17 and Node 18:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 17 or 18.

* Node 19:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Other nodes) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
