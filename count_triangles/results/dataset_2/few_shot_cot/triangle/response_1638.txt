Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> 1 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 17).
    * Pair 2: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (17, 18).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and they are directly connected as (15, 18).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (12, 14).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (7, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (9, 13).
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (9, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as other nodes are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as both nodes connected have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * Skipped due to not having at least two nodes with higher numbers to form triangles.

Adding up the triangles from each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
