Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 2. <0, 1, 2>
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> Forms a triangle with node 12. <0, 1, 12>
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> Forms a triangle with node 6. <0, 1, 6>
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 9. <0, 2, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with node 0. <0, 2, 5>
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with node 1. <1, 2, 6>
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> Forms a triangle with node 9. <0, 2, 9>
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with node 2. <2, 3, 9>
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Forms a triangle with node 1. <1, 4, 12>
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 13) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with node 14. <5, 7, 14>
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 10) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 4) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 12) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 2. <5, 7, 9>
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> Forms a triangle with node 4. <4, 7, 14>
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11 and Node 12: Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
