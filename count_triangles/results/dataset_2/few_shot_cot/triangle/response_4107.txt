Response:
Following the example provided, we will now count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 26) -> 3 and 26 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (7, 26) -> 7 and 26 are directly connected. Triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (11, 23) -> 11 and 23 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (19, 23) -> 19 and 23 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (24, 28) -> Both 24 and 28 are connected to Node 2. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (24, 25) -> Both 24 and 25 are connected to Node 2. Triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  * Pair 1: (9, 24) -> Both 9 and 24 are connected to Node 3. Triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

... 
These steps continue for all nodes, and the process is repeated for each node.
