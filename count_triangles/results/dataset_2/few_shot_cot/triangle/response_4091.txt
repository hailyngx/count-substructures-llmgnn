Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3

Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 2

Response:
Following the same approach as the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7:
    * These nodes don't have a pair that can form a triangle with at least one node greater than them.
    * Total triangles with Node 5, 6, and 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
