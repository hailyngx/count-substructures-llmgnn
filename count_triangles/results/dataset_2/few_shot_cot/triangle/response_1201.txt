Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - No pairs can be considered as they involve nodes smaller than Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Skipped pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Nodes 3, 4, and 5:
    - Similar to above, no triangles are formed given the conditions.

5. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 7:
    - Skip smaller nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    - Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    - Following the same process as above, no additional triangles are formed with these nodes.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] (<7, 9, 2> and <4, 7, 14>).
