Response:
Following the step-by-step process as mentioned in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with 1 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 3) -> Forms a triangle with 1 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with 2 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> Forms a triangle with 2 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 5: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Forms a triangle with 3 as the smallest node.
    * Skipping other pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, we find the following total triangles formed:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
