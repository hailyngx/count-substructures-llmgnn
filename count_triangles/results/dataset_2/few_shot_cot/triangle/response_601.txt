Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 0 and 5 are not connected as there is no edge (0, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 0 and 7 are not connected as there is no edge (0, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Skip any pair with nodes before 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 4

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles found for each node:

[1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 4 (Node 8) + 4 (Node 9) = 18]

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 3>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 1, 4>, <8, 9, 2>, <8, 9, 4>.
