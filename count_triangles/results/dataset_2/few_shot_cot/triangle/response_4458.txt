Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10: <0, 3, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10: <1, 11, 14>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11: <2, 3, 5>
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <2, 3, 11>
    * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <2, 5, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <3, 4, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <4, 7, 12>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8: <6, 9, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
