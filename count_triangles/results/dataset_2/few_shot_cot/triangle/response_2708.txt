Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 13 are also connected as (3, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 11 are not connected as there is no edge (3, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 2 are also connected as (3, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (13, 11) is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Since all pairs include Node 0, they are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 2: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5 because (13, 10) is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of node 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5 because (8, 10) is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of node 5. No triangle formed.
