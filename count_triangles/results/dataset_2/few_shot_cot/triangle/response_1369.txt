Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example provided:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 1 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 2 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
            * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 1 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 9.

        Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
