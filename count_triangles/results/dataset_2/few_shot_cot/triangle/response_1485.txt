Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0: Not connected to any other nodes. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 18 are connected as (7, 18) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 24) -> 7 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 24 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 18 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with Node 0 and Node 1.
    * No triangle can be formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 24) -> 2 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 24 are connected as (2, 24) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping all pairs including Node 0, 1, 2, and 3. No triangle.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (21, 22) -> Both 21 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 21 and 22 are connected as (21, 22) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6: Not connected to any other nodes. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 27) -> 12 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 12 and 14 are connected as (12, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 25) -> 12 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 12 and 25 are connected as (12, 25) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (14, 25) -> 14 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 14 and 25 are connected as (14, 25) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (27, 29) -> 27 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no 2-hop neighbors of Node 9.

We will now continue the process for Nodes 10 to 29 to find the total number of triangles.
