Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 21) - 11 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 21) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 3) - 11 and 3 are not connected because (11, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 17) - 11 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 14) - 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 17) - 3 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 17) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 21) - 3 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 21) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 14) - 3 and 14 are not connected because (3, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (17, 21) - 17 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (17, 21) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (17, 14) - 17 and 14 are not connected because (17, 14) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
  
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (formed with nodes 11 and 14)

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 does not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle. No need to proceed.

* Node 2:
    * Node 2 does not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle. No need to proceed.

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 does not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle. No need to proceed.

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 does not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle. No need to proceed.

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 does not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle. No need to proceed.

* Node 6:
    * Node 6 does not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle. No need to proceed.

* Node 7:
    * Node 7 does not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle. No need to proceed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (11, 25) - 11 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 2: (15, 25) - 15 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (15, 25) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    
* Continue this process for the remaining nodes in the graph.
