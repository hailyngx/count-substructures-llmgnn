Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 6: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1, they are connected.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving smaller numbered nodes are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* For Nodes 3 to 19, there are no triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Nodes 2 to 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
