Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> Already covered in other nodes.
        * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Already covered in other nodes.
        * Pair 3: (5, 19) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and connected as (5, 19) in the edge list.
        * Pair 4: (6, 15) -> Already covered in other nodes.
        * Pair 5: (6, 19) -> Already covered in other nodes.
        * Pair 6: (15, 19) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and connected as (15, 19) in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Already covered.
        * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> Already covered.
        * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> Already covered in other nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> Already covered.
        * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> Already covered.
        * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> Already covered.
        * Pair 4: (10, 15) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Already covered.
        * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (15, 18) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 10:
        * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 11:
        * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 12:
        * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 13:
        * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 14:
        * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 15:
        * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 16:
        * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 17:
        * No pair to consider.
        * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 18:
        * No pair to consider.
        * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 19:
        * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Already covered.
        * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

    Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
