Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (16, 19) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (15, 12) -> Connected in the edge list.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No possible triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No possible triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
