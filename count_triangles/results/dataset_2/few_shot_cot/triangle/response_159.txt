Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 8

Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, we will find the number of triangles in the graph given.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No valid triangles to form with node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No valid triangles to form with node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No valid triangles to form with node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 0 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No valid triangles to form with node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [6].
