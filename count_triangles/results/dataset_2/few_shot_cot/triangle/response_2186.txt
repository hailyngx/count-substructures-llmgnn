Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 3: (0, 6) -> Skipped as 6 is greater than 0
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Connected: Yes
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Connected: Yes
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 4: (1, 4) -> Connected: Yes
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (7, 0) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 3: (1, 4) -> Connected: Yes
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 2: (0, 5) -> Connected: Yes
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 2: (6, 3) -> Connected: Yes
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 4: (0, 7) -> Connected: Yes
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Connected: Yes
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 2: (0, 9) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Connected: Yes
    - Pair 4: (7, 9) -> Connected: Yes
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 4

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 4 (Node 7) + 4 (Node 8) + 4 (Node 9) = 30.

Therefore, there are 30 triangles in the given graph.
