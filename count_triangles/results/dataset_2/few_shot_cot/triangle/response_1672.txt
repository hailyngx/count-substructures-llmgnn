Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> 1 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 2) -> 17 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 17 and 2 are directly connected as (17, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 25) -> 9 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 25 are directly connected as (9, 25). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for all nodes.

Finally, calculate the total number of triangles in the graph: [total_number_of_triangles].
