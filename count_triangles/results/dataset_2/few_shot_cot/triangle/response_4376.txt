Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not connected because (9, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are not connected because (7, 0) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 9 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 9 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 as it is smaller than 5.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7, 8, and 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

        Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

        Hence, the final answer is [9].
