Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for counting triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 18) -> Triangle <0, 2, 18> formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 23) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 23) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (27, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 24) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (28, 24) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (28, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (28, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (24, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (24, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 27) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 22) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 6 to 29. Calculate the total number of triangles found and provide them inside brackets [] at the end.
