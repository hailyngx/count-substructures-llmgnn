Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> <0, 5, 9> (Triangle)
        * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> <0, 5, 11> (Triangle)
        * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 is connected to 0 and 6, but 0 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (9, 11) -> <0, 9, 11> (Triangle)
        * Pair 5: (9, 6) -> 9 is connected to 0 and 6, but 0 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (11, 6) -> 11 is not directly connected to 0 or 6. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0: 3

    * Node 1:

        * Total triangles with Node 3: 3

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> <4, 10, 14> (Triangle)
        * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> <4, 1, 12> (Triangle)
        * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> <4, 1, 8> (Triangle)
        * Pair 4: (12, 8) -> <4, 12, 8> (Triangle)
        * Total triangles with Node 4: 4

    * Node 5:
        * Skip, already calculated.

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 is connected to 13, but 6 is not directly connected to either. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6: 0

    * Node 7:

    * Node 8:
        * Skip, already calculated.

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> <9, 5, 12> (Triangle)
        * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> <9, 5, 0> (Triangle)

        * Skip, already calculated.

    * Node 11:
        * Skip, already calculated.

    * Node 12:

    * Node 13:
        * Skip, already calculated.

    * Node 14:
        * Skip, already calculated.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0) + 6 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 9) = 22

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [22].
