Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Continue the process for Node 1 step-by-step like done for Node 0.

Continue this process for each node while forming and counting the triangles. Then, calculate the total number of triangles in the graph. 

Finally, provide the output as requested inside brackets [].
