Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Following the example provided: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

There are no triangles found in this graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
