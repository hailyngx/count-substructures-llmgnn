Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 20 as the third node. Triangle: <1, 3, 13>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Continuing to analyze Nodes 10 to 29...

* Node 10:
    * No possible triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (16, 27) -> Forms a triangle with Node 25 as the third node. Triangle: <11, 16, 27>
    * No other possible triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No possible triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (14, 26) -> Forms a triangle with Node 29 as the third node. Triangle: <14, 26, 29>
    * No other possible triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No possible triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No possible triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No possible triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No possible triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 20:
    * No possible triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 21:
    * No possible triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 22:
    * No possible triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 23:
    * No possible triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 24:
    * No possible triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 25:
    * No possible triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 26:
    * No possible triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 27:
    * No possible triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 28:
    * No possible triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 29:
    * No possible triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summing up all the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 11) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
