Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are both neighbors of node 0 and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 27) -> 6 and 27 are both neighbors of node 1 but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are both neighbors of node 2 but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 24) -> 5 and 24 are both neighbors of node 3 and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are both neighbors of node 4 but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (20, 23) -> 20 and 23 are both neighbors of node 5 but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 25) -> 12 and 25 are both neighbors of node 6 but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 28) -> 11 and 28 are both neighbors of node 7 and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (18, 21) -> 18 and 21 are both neighbors of node 8 but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip a pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 9.
    * Pair 1: (16, 25) -> 16 and 25 are both neighbors of node 9 but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (7, 28) -> 7 and 28 are both neighbors of node 10 but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* The rest of the nodes have no triangles when following the process.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
