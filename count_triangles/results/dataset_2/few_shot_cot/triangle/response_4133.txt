Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (9, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (8, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (3, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.

    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (6, 3) shown in the edge list.

    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Now, let's continue this process for the remaining nodes.

* Node 6:
    * Skipping all pairs as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipping all pairs as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected as (2, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing for Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skipping all pairs as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 11.

* Node 12:
    * Skipping all pairs as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 12.

* Node 13:
    * Skipping all pairs as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 13.

* Node 14:
    * Skipping all pairs as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
