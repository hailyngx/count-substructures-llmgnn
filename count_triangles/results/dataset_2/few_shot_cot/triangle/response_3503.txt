Response:
Following the same steps as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 27) -> 1 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 27 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 27) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 19 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 2 and 13 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 26) -> 3 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 26 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 22) -> 3 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 22 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 10 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 5 and 14 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6 to 24:
    * Skipping these nodes for now as they were not covered yet in the previous calculations.

Continuing with the rest of the nodes:

* Node 25:
    * Pair 1: (25, 27) -> 25 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 25, and 25 and 27 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 26:
    * Pair 1: (26, 8) -> 26 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 26, and 26 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 27:
    * Pair 1: (27, 1) -> 27 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 27, but 27 and 1 are not directly connected as there is no edge (27, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 28 and 29:
    * No triangles can be formed with nodes 28 and 29 as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles found so far:

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + ... (pending calculations for the rest of the nodes)
