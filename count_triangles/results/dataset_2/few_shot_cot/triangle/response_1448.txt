Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 8>
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 2 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 1 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 2 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 1 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip all other pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 6 and have been accounted for.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
