Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are greater than 0.
    * Pair 1: (14, 22) -> 14 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 22 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 4 as they are greater than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 27) -> 2 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 3 and consider Node 4 onward for pairs.
    * Pair 1: (1, 29) -> 1 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip Nodes 4 and onward as they are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 5 and onward as they are greater than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 6 and go directly to Node 10.
    * Pair 1: (1, 29) -> 1 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 6 to 29:

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (25, 28) -> 25 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 to Node 16:
    * No triangles are formed with Nodes 8 to 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 17, and they are not directly connected as there is no edge (13, 18) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18 to Node 24:
    * No triangles are formed with Nodes 18 to 24 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 25:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 26 to 29 as they are greater than 25.
    * Pair 1: (15, 21) -> 15 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 25, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 26 to 29:
    * No triangles are formed with Nodes 26 to 29 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Nodes 9 to 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Nodes 18 to 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Nodes 26 to 29) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
