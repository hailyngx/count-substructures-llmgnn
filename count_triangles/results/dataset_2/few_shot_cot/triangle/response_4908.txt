Response:
Following the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the graph by following the same step-by-step process for each node. 

1. Node 0:
    No triangles are formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    <1, 8, 27>
    No other triangles are formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    <2, 24, 28>
    <2, 12, 28>
    No other triangles are formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. Node 3:
    No triangles are formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    <4, 9, 26>
    <4, 9, 21>
    <4, 14, 22>
    No other triangles are formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

6. Node 5:
    No triangles are formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    <6, 7, 19>
    <6, 7, 21>
    No other triangles are formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

8. Node 7:
    <7, 9, 27>
    No other triangles are formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    <8, 10, 25>
    No other triangles are formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Node 9:
    No triangles are formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Nodes 10 to 30:
    Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
