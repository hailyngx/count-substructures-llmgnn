Response:
Following the same method as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 4: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
