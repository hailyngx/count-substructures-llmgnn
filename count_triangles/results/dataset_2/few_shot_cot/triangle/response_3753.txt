Response:
Following the same approach used in the example provided above, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (11, 13), but since 11 and 13 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [4].
