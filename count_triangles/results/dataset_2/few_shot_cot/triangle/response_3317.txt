Response:
Following the same process as in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed as 4, 7, and 0 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 11 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 1 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 11 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> Triangle formed as 0, 12, and 1 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 10) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 10 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Triangle formed as 8, 12, and 2 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 5 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 14 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed as 6, 9, and 4 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed as 6, 7, and 4 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> Triangle formed as 6, 0, and 4 are connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 10) -> Triangle formed as 6, 10, and 4 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 13 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Triangle formed as 9, 10, and 6 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 11 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Triangle formed as 0, 4, and 7 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 13 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped over as they lack at least 2 other larger numbered nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 6, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
