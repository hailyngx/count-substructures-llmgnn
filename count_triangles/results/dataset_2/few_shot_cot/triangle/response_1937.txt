Response:
Following the method described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Both 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> Both 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) -> Both 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> Both 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Both 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> Both 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 0) -> Both 13 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 10) -> Both 13 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> Both 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13 and Node 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 13 or 14.

Summarizing the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [6].
