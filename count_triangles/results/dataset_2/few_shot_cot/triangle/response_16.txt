Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> Triangle formed with Node 12 (14, 12, 18).
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 12 (18, 0, 12).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9 to 19:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.  
The triangles are:  
[<12, 14, 18>, <0, 12, 18>]
