Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <1, 4, 8>
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Triangle formed: <2, 11, 17>
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue the same process for Nodes 4 to 19:

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Triangle formed: <6, 7, 14>
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> Triangle formed: <7, 13, 17>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 9 and 10:
    * Skipped as there are no triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> Triangle formed: <11, 13, 17>
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (17, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 13 and 14:
    * Skipped as there are already triangles counted with these nodes.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (16, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 19) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 unique triangles in the given graph.
The list of unique triangles found is: <0, 5, 6> <0, 6, 7> <0, 5, 7> <1, 4, 8> <2, 11, 17> <6, 7, 14> <7, 13, 17>.
The final answer is [7].
