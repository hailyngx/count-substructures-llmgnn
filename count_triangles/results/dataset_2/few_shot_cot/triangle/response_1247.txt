Response:
Following the example provided, let's go through each node in the graph to count the number of triangles and find the unique triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 5), but since 4 and 5 are both smaller than 8, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 8.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 2>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<8, 9, 6>
