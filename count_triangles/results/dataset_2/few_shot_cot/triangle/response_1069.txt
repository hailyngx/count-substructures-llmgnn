Response:
Following the step-by-step method to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4).
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8).
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 13 are directly connected as (4, 13).
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are directly connected as (5, 8).
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 4 through 14. Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph after considering all nodes.
