Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 19) -> Both 6 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 0, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 19) -> Both 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 19 are connected as (7, 0, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 19) -> Both 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 19 are connected as (8, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 16) -> Both 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> Both 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 16) -> Both 7 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) -> Both 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (16, 2) -> Both 16 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19, and sum up the total number of triangles.
