Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) - No triangles formed as 4 and 10 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) - No triangles formed as 9 and 10 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) - No triangles formed as 7 and 2 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) - Both 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 as they are smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
