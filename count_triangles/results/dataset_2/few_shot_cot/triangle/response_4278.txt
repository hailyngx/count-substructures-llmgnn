Response:
Following step-by-step process described in the example provided, here is the count of triangles for each node and the total number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Node 5 and Node 3 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Node 4 and Node 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (4, 1) -> Node 4 and Node 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 8.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Node 1 and Node 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 9.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> Node 9 and Node 4 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<5, 6, 1>, <4, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 5>, <5, 8, 6>, <6, 8, 1>, <8, 5, 1>, <8, 4, 5>, <8, 1, 2>, <4, 8, 2>.
