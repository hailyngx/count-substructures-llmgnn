Response:
Following the same process described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 18) -> 1 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs for forming triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs for forming triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 17 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs for forming triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs for forming triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs present to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 11 and 19 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs for forming triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

    * No other pairs for forming triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs present to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 11 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs for forming triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, and Node 13:
    * No pairs present to form triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 10, 11, 12, and 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No pairs available to form triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Node 15 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles can be formed with this node.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No pairs present to form triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17 and Node 18:
    * Skip, as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 17 and 18 to form triangles.

* Node 19:
    * No pairs present to form triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 7.
* Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
