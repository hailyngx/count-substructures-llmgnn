Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) - Both 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) - Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) - Both 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (0, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (0, 4) - Both 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 0 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) - Both 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
