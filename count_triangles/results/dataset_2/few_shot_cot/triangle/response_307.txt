Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 10 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5. No other nodes can form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8. No other nodes can form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9. No other nodes can form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 12.  
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 4) 
* Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
