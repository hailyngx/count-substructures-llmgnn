Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Both 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than each specific node as there are no larger nodes to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
