Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Both 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 11 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> Both 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 11 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 4) -> Both 11 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 14) -> Both 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 12 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [5].
