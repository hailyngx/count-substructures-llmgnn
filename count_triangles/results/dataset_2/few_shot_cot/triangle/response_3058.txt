Response:
Following the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
