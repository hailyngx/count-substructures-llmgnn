Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list. <3, 7, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list. <0, 5, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list. <4, 3, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
