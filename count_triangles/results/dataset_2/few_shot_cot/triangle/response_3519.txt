Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 24) - Both 11 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 28) - Both 11 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 19) - Both 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (24, 28) - Both 24 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (24, 19) - Both 24 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (28, 19) - Both 28 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (13, 28) - Both 13 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (18, 2) - Both 18 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 29) - Both 5 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 27) - Both 5 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) - Both 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (29, 27) - Both 29 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (29, 3) - Both 29 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (27, 3) - Both 27 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2
