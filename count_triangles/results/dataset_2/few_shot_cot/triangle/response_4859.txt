Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle <0, 5, 6> identified.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Triangle <0, 5, 7> identified.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Triangle <0, 6, 7> identified.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle <1, 4, 5> identified.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Triangle <2, 4, 8> identified.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Triangle <3, 4, 8> identified.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle <4, 5, 8> identified.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle <7, 5, 9> identified.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
