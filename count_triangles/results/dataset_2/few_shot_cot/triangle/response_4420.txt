Response:
Following the steps provided in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
