Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) - 12 and 17 are directly connected as (0, 17) in the edge list. 17 is also connected to 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 19) - 12 and 19 are directly connected as (0, 12) in the edge list. 19 is also connected to 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) - 14 and 15 are directly connected as (14, 15) in the edge list. 15 is also connected to 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 18) - 7 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are directly connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. 7 is also connected to 2, but 3 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. No other triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are directly connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. No other triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) - 9 and 16 are directly connected as (9, 16) in the edge list. No other triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) - 11 and 15 are directly connected as (11, 15) in the edge list. No other triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) - 9 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (12, 17) - This pair has already been considered. No other triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing for Nodes 11 to 19:

* Node 11:
    * No new triangles can be formed.
* Node 12:
    * No new triangles can be formed.
* Node 13:
    * No new triangles can be formed.
* Node 14:
    * No new triangles can be formed.
* Node 15:
    * No new triangles can be formed.
* Node 16:
    * No new triangles can be formed.
* Node 17:
    * No new triangles can be formed.
* Node 18:
    * No new triangles can be formed.
* Node 19:
    * No new triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 3.

Therefore, 3 triangles are in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
