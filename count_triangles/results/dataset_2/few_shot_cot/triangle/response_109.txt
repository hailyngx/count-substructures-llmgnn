Response:
Following the provided graph information, apply the process of counting triangles to find the total number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> Both 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 0, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> Both 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 11) -> Both 8 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 6) -> Both 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (8, 0, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 2) -> Both 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (8, 4, 2) in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes smaller numbered nodes than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pair with smaller numbered nodes than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles found for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0)
Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles found in the graph are <5, 0, 6>, <8, 0, 6>, and <8, 4, 2>.
