Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected to 0, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (5), Node 1 (9), and Node 7 (1). Triangle <5, 9, 1>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected to 1, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (5), Node 1 (2), and Node 3 (5). Triangle <5, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 6: (9, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (9), Node 1 (1), and Node 7 (1). Triangle <9, 1, 7>.
    * Pair 7: (9, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (9), Node 1 (7), and Node 7 (9). Triangle <9, 7, 1>.
    * Pair 8: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (1), Node 1 (6), and Node 3 (1). Triangle <1, 6, 3>.
    * Pair 9: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (1, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (1), Node 1 (2), and Node 3 (1). Triangle <1, 2, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (5), Node 1 (4), and Node 3 (5). Triangle <5, 4, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (5), Node 1 (3), and Node 3 (5). Triangle <5, 3, 2>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (5), Node 1 (1), and Node 3 (5). Triangle <5, 1, 2>.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (3), Node 1 (4), and Node 3 (2). Triangle <3, 4, 2>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (5), Node 1 (4), and Node 3 (3). Triangle <5, 4, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected to 3, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (5), Node 1 (8), and Node 3 (3). Triangle <5, 8, 3>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 (4), Node 1 (7), and Node 3 (3). Triangle <4, 7, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
