Response:
Following the same method as demonstrated in the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with lower-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with lower-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 0) -> 11 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with lower-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
