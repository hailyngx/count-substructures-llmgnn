    * Pair 1: (20, 29) -> Both 20 and 29 are connected to node 0, but they are not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 29) -> 10 and 29 are connected to node 1, but they are not directly connected to each other. No triangle formed.
