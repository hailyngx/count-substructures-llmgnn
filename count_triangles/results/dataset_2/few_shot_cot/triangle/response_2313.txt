Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2


* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (13, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2


* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0


* Node 3:

    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1


* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3


* Node 8:
    * Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles can be formed involving Node 8.


* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1


* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0


Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 2 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [13].
