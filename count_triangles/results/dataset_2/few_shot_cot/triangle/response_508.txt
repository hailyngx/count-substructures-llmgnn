Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as all other nodes are greater than it.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) - 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0, 1 or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) - 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. forming a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
