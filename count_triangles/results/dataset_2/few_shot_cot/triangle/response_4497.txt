Response:
Following the same process as described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 2) and (1, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 4) and (10, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 9) and (9, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (9, 11) and (11, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (8, 13) and (13, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 6) and (6, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
