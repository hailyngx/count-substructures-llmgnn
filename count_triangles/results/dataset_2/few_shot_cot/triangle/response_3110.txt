Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Connected through Node 4, Node 0, and Node 10. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 10>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> Connected through Node 4, Node 1, and Node 13. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> Connected through Node 4, Node 1, and Node 13. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2: 
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Connected through Node 4, Node 8, and Node 3. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Connected through Node 4, Node 10, and Node 3. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 10>.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> Connected through Node 8, Node 10, and Node 3. Triangle formed: <3, 8, 10>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 as they are smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 3) = 6
* Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
