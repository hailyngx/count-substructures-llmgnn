Response:
Following the same method as described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Skip, both are smaller nodes.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Skip, both are smaller nodes.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Skip, both are smaller nodes.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Skip, one node is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip as it has no pairs to form triangles with larger nodes.

* Node 6:
    * Skip as it has no pairs to form triangles with larger nodes.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> Skip, both are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> Skip, both are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Skip, both are smaller nodes.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> Skip, one node is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skip as it has no pairs to form triangles with larger nodes.

* Node 13:
    * Skip as it has no pairs to form triangles with larger nodes.

* Node 14:
    * Skip as it has no pairs to form triangles with larger nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
