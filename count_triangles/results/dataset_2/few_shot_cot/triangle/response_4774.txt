Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 2 are connected as shown in (6, 2) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 0 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 9). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are connected as shown in (2, 9) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in (4, 6) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in (7, 8) edge. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.
    
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
