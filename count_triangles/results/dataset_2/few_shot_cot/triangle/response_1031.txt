Response:
Following the process described in the previous example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * <1, 17, 4> - Formed by edges (1, 17), (17, 4), (4, 1).
    * <1, 17, 7> - Formed by edges (1, 17), (17, 7), (7, 1).
    * <1, 12, 18> - Formed by edges (1, 12), (12, 18), (18, 1).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * <2, 8, 18> - Formed by edges (2, 8), (8, 18), (18, 2).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * <7, 4, 17> - Formed by edges (7, 4), (4, 17), (17, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
