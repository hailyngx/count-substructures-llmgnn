Response:
Following the same methodology as in the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Skip all pairs involving Node 0 since there are no nodes greater than Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Triangle formed <1, 9, 12>.
    - Pair 2: (9, 16) -> Triangle formed <1, 9, 16>.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (11, 13) -> Triangle formed <8, 11, 13>.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (12, 15) -> Triangle formed <9, 12, 15>.
    - Pair 2: (9, 16) -> Triangle formed <9, 15, 16>.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 10:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 9 as they are smaller than Node 10.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 11:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 10 as they are smaller than Node 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 12:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 11 as they are smaller than Node 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 13:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 12 as they are smaller than Node 13.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 14:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 13 as they are smaller than Node 14.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 15:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 14 as they are smaller than Node 15.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 16:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 15 as they are smaller than Node 16.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 17:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 to 16 as they are smaller than Node 17.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 18:
    - Pair 1: (14, 8) -> Triangle formed <8, 14, 18>.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 19:
    - Pair 1: (17, 1) -> Triangle formed <1, 17, 19>.
    - Pair 2: (17, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 16) -> Triangle formed <1, 16, 19>.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Calculating the total number of triangles:
[<1, 9, 12>, <1, 9, 16>, <8, 11, 13>, <9, 12, 15>, <9, 15, 16>, <18, 14, 8>, <1, 17, 19>, <1, 16, 19>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
