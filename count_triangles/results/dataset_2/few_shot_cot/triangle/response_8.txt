Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as well as (3, 11) edge is present. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 11>
    - Pair 2: (3, 2) -> Both 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 as well as (3, 5) edge is present. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as well as (3, 2) edge is present. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 2>
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as well as (3, 5) edge is present. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue the same process for the rest of the nodes in the graph.

4. Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 13>
    - Pair 2: (13, 5) -> Forms a triangle. Triangle formed: <5, 13, 6>
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

8. Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (0, 13) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 11>
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

13. Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
