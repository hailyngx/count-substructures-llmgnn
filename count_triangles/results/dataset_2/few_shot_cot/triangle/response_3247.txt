Response:
Following the same method as the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 2 are also connected as (6, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
