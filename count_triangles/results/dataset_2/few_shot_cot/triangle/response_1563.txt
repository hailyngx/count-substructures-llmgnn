Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    - <1, 7, 13> Triangle formed.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    - <2, 4, 14> Triangle formed.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - <4, 10, 16> Triangle formed.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - <5, 11, 19> Triangle formed.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    - <18, 4, 16> Triangle formed.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 18) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

[<1, 7, 13>, <2, 4, 14>, <4, 10, 16>, <5, 11, 19>, <18, 4, 16>]
