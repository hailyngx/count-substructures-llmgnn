    * Pair 3: (1, 13) - Skipped because 1 and 13 are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 4: (1, 14) - Skipped because 1 and 14 are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 5: (2, 11) - Skipped because 2 and 11 are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 6: (2, 13) - Skipped because 2 and 13 are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 7: (2, 14) - Skipped because 2 and 14 are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 8: (11, 13) - Skipped because 11 and 13 are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 9: (11, 14) - Skipped because 11 and 14 are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 10: (13, 14) - Skipped because 13 and 14 are smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
