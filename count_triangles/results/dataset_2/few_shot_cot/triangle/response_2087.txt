Response:
Following the same step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (9, 19) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (10, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (10, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (12, 13) shown in the edge list.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 8 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 3 (Node 12) + 4 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 25
