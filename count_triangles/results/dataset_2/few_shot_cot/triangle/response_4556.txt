Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0. 
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0. 
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
