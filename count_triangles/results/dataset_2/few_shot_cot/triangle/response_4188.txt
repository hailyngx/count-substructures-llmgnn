Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 5. Triangle <0, 2, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 4. Triangle <1, 4, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 9. Triangle <2, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 1. Triangle <1, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 5. Triangle <1, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 5. Triangle <2, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 4. Triangle <3, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 5. Triangle <1, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 3. Triangle <3, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No pairs left to consider as all other nodes are smaller than 5. No additional triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 1. Triangle <1, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 9. Triangle <5, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 4. Triangle <3, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 5. Triangle <2, 5, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 2. Triangle <2, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 1. Triangle <1, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 and Node 5. Triangle <5, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 16.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
