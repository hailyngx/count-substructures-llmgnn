Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 5: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 6: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 7: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 8: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 9: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 10: (14, 11) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: {0, 11, 14}.
    * Pair 11: (14, 6) -> No triangle formed as 14 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 12: (14, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: {0, 2, 14}.
    * Pair 13: (11, 6) -> No triangle formed as 11 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: {1, 6, 10}.
    * Pair 5: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Pair 6: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed as 10 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: {0, 2, 14}.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 4: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 5: (14, 8) -> No triangle formed as 14 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 6: (14, 1) -> No triangle formed as 14 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 7: (14, 3) -> No triangle formed as 14 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 8: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 9: (8, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: {2, 3, 8}.
    * Pair 10: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continuing this process for Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, and then summing up the total triangles formed will give us the answer. Let's continue calculating for the remaining nodes.
