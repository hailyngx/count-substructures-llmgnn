Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed starting with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
