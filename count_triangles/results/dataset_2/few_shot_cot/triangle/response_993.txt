Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 13 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, continue the process for Nodes 8 to 19:

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all other pairs due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip all other pairs due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip all other pairs due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip all other pairs due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip all other pairs due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip all other pairs due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Skip all other pairs due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip all other pairs due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip all other pairs due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip all other pairs due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip all other pairs due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [1].
