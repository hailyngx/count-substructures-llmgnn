Response:
Following the method explained in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Connected to 8 and 9. 8 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) - Connected to 0 and 7. 0 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) - Connected to 0 and 2. 0 and 2 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs involving Node 0 are considered as they are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) - Both 7 and 2 are connected to 1, but 7 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) - Connected to 1 and 14. 1 and 14 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 10) - Connected to 1 and 10. 1 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs involving Node 1 are considered as they are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) - Both 0 and 14 are connected to 2, but 0 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 10) - Connected to 0 and 10. 0 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) - Connected to 2 and 12. 2 and 12 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs involving Node 2 are considered as they are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) - Connected to 12 and 13. 12 and 13 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs involving Node 3 are considered as they are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) - Connected to 3 and 11. 3 and 11 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs involving Node 4 are considered as they are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Connected to 4 and 8. 4 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) - Connected to 4 and 12. 4 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs involving Node 5 are considered as they are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) - Connected to 3 and 12. 3 and 12 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs involving Node 6 are considered as they are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) - Connected to 0 and 11. 0 and 11 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs involving Node 7 are considered as they are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
