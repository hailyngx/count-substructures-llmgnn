Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Since 8, 9, and 0 together form a triangle <0, 8, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Since 3, 5, and 3 together form a triangle <3, 5, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Since 4, 7, and 6 together form a triangle <4, 7, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
