Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example with individual nodes:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 5) and (1, 19). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip the pair involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 0) -> 19 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 1) -> 10 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (10, 2) and (1, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 1) -> 19 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (1, 2) and (2, 19). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (17, 12) -> 17 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 7) -> 17 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 17) and (3, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 7) -> 12 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (11, 18) and (4, 18). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process similarly for Nodes 6 to 19 will yield the total number of triangles in the graph.
