Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 6.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) - Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) - Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Pair 5: (6, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) - Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Pair 7: (7, 3) - Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No new triangles can be formed starting from Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No new triangles can be formed starting from Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No new triangles can be formed starting from Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No new triangles can be formed starting from Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed starting from Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 5 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
