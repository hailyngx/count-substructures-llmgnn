Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 2. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].

[Note: The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 9, 6>, <0, 9, 3>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 7>.]
