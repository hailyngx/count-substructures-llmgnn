Response:
Following the same method as the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 24) -> 12 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no edge connecting them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 24) -> 8 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no edge connecting them directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected directly as (8, 12) shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 4: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected directly as (8, 13) shown in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge connecting them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 21) -> 3 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge connecting them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 21) -> 7 and 21 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (15, 13) -> Both 15 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (15, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (14, 29) -> Both 14 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (14, 29) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (17, 23) -> Both 17 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge connecting them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Since Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes, it cannot form any triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (29, 28) -> Both 29 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (29, 28) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 to Node 29:
    * Repeat the process for nodes 8 to 29 as we did for the nodes above following a similar procedure to count the triangles.

After going through each node, we can count the total triangles in the graph and list the unique triangles found inside brackets:
