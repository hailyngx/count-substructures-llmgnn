Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) - Formed triangle with nodes 1, 15 and 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (15, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (15, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <0, 1, 15>

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) - Formed triangle with nodes 2, 14 and 1.
    * Pair 2: (2, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (19, 18) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <1, 2, 14>

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 since they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 19) - Formed triangle with nodes 17, 19, and 3.
    * Pair 6: (5, 19) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <3, 17, 19>

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) - Formed triangle with nodes 0, 15, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <0, 7, 15>

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles: 4
* Unique triangles: <0, 1, 15>, <1, 2, 14>, <3, 17, 19>, <0, 7, 15>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
