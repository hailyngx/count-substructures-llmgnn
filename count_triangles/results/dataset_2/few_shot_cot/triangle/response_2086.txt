Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 8) -> 11 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (11, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 1) and (2, 1) in the edge list, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (9, 2) and (1, 2) in the edge list, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (9, 3) and (5, 3) in the edge list, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 10) -> 11 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (11, 4) and (10, 4), forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (0, 11) and (11, 5), forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (9, 6) and (10, 6) in the edge list, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 11) -> 13 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (9, 8) and (8, 7) in the edge list, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
