Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 8 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, 6, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
