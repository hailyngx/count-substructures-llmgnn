Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) <br>
      -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected (4, 5) exists. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) <br>
      -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected (4, 5) exists. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) <br>
      -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) <br>
      -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected (4, 5) exists. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) <br>
      -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) <br>
      -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected (5, 7) exists. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (7, 8) <br>
      -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) <br>
      -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected (6, 9) exists. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) <br>
      -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected (6, 9) exists. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. 
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) <br>
      -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected (6, 8) exists. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. 
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) <br>
      -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected (4, 9) exists. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 8) <br>
      -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 8 and 9:
    - Skipped because they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
