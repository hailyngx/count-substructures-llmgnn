Response:
Following the step-by-step method to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are directly connected, forming a pair of triangles with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 8) -> 12 and 8 are directly connected, forming a pair of triangles with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are directly connected, forming a pair of triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No valid pairs for Node 4 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are directly connected, forming a pair of triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are directly connected, forming a pair of triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * No valid pairs for Node 10 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * No valid pairs for Node 11 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are directly connected, forming a pair of triangles with Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * No valid pairs for Node 13 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * No valid pairs for Node 14 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<3, 4, 11>, <8, 9, 10>, <0, 3, 12>, <9, 10, 13>, <12, 13, 14>.

Thus, the final answer is [5].
