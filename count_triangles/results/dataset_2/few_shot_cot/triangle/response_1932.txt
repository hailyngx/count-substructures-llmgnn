Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the third node <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - Node 2 is connected to Node 8, but Node 8 is not connected to Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) - Node 2 is connected to Node 12, but Node 12 is not connected to Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) - Node 5 is connected to Node 8, but Node 5 is not connected to Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the third node <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> Node 5 is connected to Node 1, but Node 1 is not connected to Node 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 as the third node <4, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
