Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 16) -> 17 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) - Both 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) - 15 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) - Same as the previous case. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5 to Node 19:
    * Skipping these nodes as they are smaller than Node 8, and no triangles can be formed with them as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) - 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 17) - Same as the pair with Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 17) - Same as Pair 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [2].
