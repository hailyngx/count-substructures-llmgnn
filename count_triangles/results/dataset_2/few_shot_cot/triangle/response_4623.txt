    - (14, 12): Both 14 and 12 are connected to Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - (14, 2): Both 14 and 2 are connected to Node 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    Pairs:
    - (0, 13): Both 0 and 13 are connected to Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - (0, 7): Both 0 and 7 are connected to Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 12) = 7

[7 triangles found in the given graph.]

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 14>
<3, 7, 12>
<4, 15, 18>
<5, 10, 13>
<6, 8, 17>
