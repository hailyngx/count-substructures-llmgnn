Response:
Following the process described in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) - 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) - 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) - 7 and 6 are directly connected. No other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) - 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) - 10 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 4) - 10 and 4 are directly connected. No other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) - 8 and 7 are directly connected. No other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 2) - 13 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 1) - 13 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. No other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) - 11 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) - 17 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 15) - 17 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 6) - 17 and 6 are directly connected. No other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair is (8, 0), but since 8 and 0 are directly connected, no other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 0) - 13 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 3) - 13 and 3 are directly connected. No other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair is (18, 1), but since 18 and 1 are directly connected, no other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19: No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of nodes that are both 1-hop neighbors and directly connected to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
