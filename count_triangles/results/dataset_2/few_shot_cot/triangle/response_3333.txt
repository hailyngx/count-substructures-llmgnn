Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 13) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more potential triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Already counted above when processing Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> Already counted above when processing Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
