Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Connected and 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 - Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) -> Connected but not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) -> Connected and 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 - Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> Connected but not 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Connected and 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 - Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> Connected and 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 - Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> Connected but not 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> Connected but not 1-hop neighbors of Node 4 - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> Connected but not 1-hop neighbors of Node 8 - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> Connected but not 1-hop neighbors of Node 11 - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> Connected but not 1-hop neighbors of Node 12 - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 17) -> Connected but not 1-hop neighbors of Node 12 - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Connected but not 1-hop neighbors of Node 18 - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summing up the triangles from each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
