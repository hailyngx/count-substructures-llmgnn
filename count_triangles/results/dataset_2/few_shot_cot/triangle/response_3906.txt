Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 22) -> 9 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 20) -> 9 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (9, 20) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 29) -> 12 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (12, 29) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (29, 15) -> 29 and 15 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (28, 6) -> 28 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (28, 5) -> 28 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 16) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 24) -> 5 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 24) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (16, 24) -> 16 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (16, 24) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5.

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skip these nodes as they have already been considered in previous calculations.

The process continues similarly for the remaining nodes to count the total number of triangles.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph and listing the unique triangles:
[Total number of triangles = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6]

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
[<5, 16, 24>, <5, 16, 4>, <5, 24, 4>, <16, 24, 4>, <1, 12, 29>, <9, 20, 27>]
