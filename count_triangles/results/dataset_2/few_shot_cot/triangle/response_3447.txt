Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pairs: (1, 5) <0, 1, 5>; No other triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest node.

* Node 1:
    - Pairs: (4, 9) <1, 4, 9>; No other triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest node.

* Node 2:
    - Pairs: None; No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest node.

* Node 3:
    - Pairs: (9, 12) <3, 9, 12>; No other triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest node.

* Node 4:
    - Pairs: (5, 11) <4, 5, 11>; No other triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest node.

* Node 5:
    - Pairs: None; No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest node.

* Node 6:
    - Pairs: (11, 14) <6, 11, 14>; No other triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest node.

* Node 7:
    - Pairs: (6, 14) <7, 6, 14>; No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest node.

* Node 8:
    - Pairs: None; No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest node.

* Node 9:
    - Pairs: None; No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.

* Node 10:
    - Pairs: (5, 13) <10, 5, 13>; No other triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest node.

* Node 11:
    - Pairs: None; No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest node.

* Node 12:
    - Pairs: None; No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest node.

* Node 13:
    - Pairs: (2, 14) <13, 2, 14>; No other triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest node.

* Node 14:
    - Pairs: (4, 11) <14, 4, 11>; No other triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph =  1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
