Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 4.
    - Pair 2: (7, 25) -> Forms a triangle with Node 25 and Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14 and Node 4.
    - Pair 2: (1, 25) -> Forms a triangle with Node 25 and Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (14, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14 and Node 15.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (7, 25) -> Forms a triangle with Node 25 and Node 7.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pair with Node 5 as it is smaller than 6.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (25, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 25 and Node 15.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (17, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 17 and Node 12.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 15:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    - Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 11) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 8, 14>
<7, 25, 15>
<1, 25, 4>
<0, 7, 25>
<0, 8, 4>
<11, 17, 12>
<1, 4, 14>
<4, 14, 15>
<0, 4, 14>

Thus, the final answer is [9].
