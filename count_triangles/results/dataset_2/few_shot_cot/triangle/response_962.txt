Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (6, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (0, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
