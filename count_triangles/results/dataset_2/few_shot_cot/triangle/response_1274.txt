This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5)

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
