Response:
Let's systematically go through each node to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it has neighbors 5, 14, 1, and there is no mutual connection between these neighbors. (Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0)

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 due to the lack of mutual connections between its neighbors 6, 0, 14. (Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0)

* Node 2:
    - Triangle 1: <2, 6, 14> - Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 14, and they are connected to each other. (Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1)

* Node 3:
    - Triangle 1: <3, 4, 9> - Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and they are connected to each other. (Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1)

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no mutual connections between its neighbors 9, 3, 10, 2. (Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0)

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 due to the lack of mutual connections between its neighbors 6, 11, 0, 7. (Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0)

* Node 6:
    - Triangle 1: <2, 6, 9> - Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and they are connected to each other. (Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1)

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no mutual connections between its neighbors 5, 14, 12, 11, 8, 13. (Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0)

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no mutual connections between its neighbors 9, 7, 3, 10. (Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0)

* Node 9:
    - Triangle 1: <3, 4, 9> - Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and they are connected to each other. (Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1)

* Node 10:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 10 due to the lack of mutual connections between its neighbors 8, 4, 13. (Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0)

* Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as there are no mutual connections between its neighbors 9, 5, 7, 2. (Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0)

* Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as there are no mutual connections between its neighbors 14, 7, 3. (Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0)

* Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as there are no mutual connections between its neighbors 7, 10, 2. (Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0)

* Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 due to the lack of mutual connections between its neighbors 0, 1, 7, 12, 2. (Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0)

    Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
    [1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) = 4]

    Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
