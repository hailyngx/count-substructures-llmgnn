Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) - 5 and 13 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) - 11 and 13 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 19) - 4 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 19 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) - 4 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 16) - 19 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 19 and 16 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) - 18 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 18 and 19 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 13) - 18 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 18 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7:
    * Skip these nodes as they are smaller than 4.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) - 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 10 and 11 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 9, 10, 11:
    * Skip these nodes as they are smaller than 8.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 as they are smaller than 12.
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) - 16 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and 16 and 19 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 13, 14, 15:
    * Skip these nodes as they are smaller than 12.

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 as they are smaller than 16.
    * Pair 1: (19, 12) - 19 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 16, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip this node as it is smaller than 16.

* Nodes 18 and 19:
    * Skip these nodes as they are smaller than 16.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 16) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
