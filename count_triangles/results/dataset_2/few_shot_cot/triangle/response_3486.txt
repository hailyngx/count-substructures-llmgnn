Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 8 <0, 6, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 5 <1, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 9 <1, 6, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 and Node 6 <4, 7, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 1 <4, 8, 1>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 2 <5, 6, 2>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6, or 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 1 <8, 4, 1>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7
* [7]

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
