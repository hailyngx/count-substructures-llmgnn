Response:
Let's go through each node step-by-step to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (2, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (9, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 11.

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
