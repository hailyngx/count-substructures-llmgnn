Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (12, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 15) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (21, 5) -> 21 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (21, 5) -> 21 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (21, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (21, 0) -> 21 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (21, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (5, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: No pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (28, 6) -> 28 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4 because (28, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

The process will continue for Nodes 5 to 29, and then the total number of triangles will be summed up to get the final count of triangles in the graph.
The final answer will be provided inside brackets [].
