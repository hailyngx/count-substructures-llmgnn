Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> Both 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs for Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs for Node 2.
