Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected to Node 0 and linked as edge (4, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are directly connected to Node 1 but not linked. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are directly connected to Node 2 and linked as edge (6, 17). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles found are <4, 8, 0>, <6, 17, 2>, <10, 6, 17>.
