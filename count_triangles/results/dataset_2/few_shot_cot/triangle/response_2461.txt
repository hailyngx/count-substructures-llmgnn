Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
   - No triangles involving Node 0.

2. **Node 1**:
   - <1, 11, 7> -> Nodes 1, 11, and 7 are all connected to each other forming a triangle.
   - <1, 11, 29> -> Nodes 1, 11, and 29 are all connected to each other forming a triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. **Node 2**:
   - <2, 18, 23> -> Nodes 2, 18, and 23 are all connected to each other forming a triangle.
   - <2, 18, 28> -> Nodes 2, 18, and 28 are all connected to each other forming a triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. **Node 3**:
   - No triangles involving Node 3.

5. **Node 4**:
   - <4, 15, 20> -> Nodes 4, 15, and 20 are all connected to each other forming a triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5**:
   - No triangles involving Node 5.

7. **Node 6**:
   - <6, 7, 23> -> Nodes 6, 7, and 23 are all connected to each other forming a triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. **Node 7**:
   - Skip triangle calculation for Node 7 as it has already been included in Node 1 and Node 6.

29. **Node 28**:
    - Skip triangle calculation for Node 28 as it has already been included in Node 2.

30. **Node 29**:
    - No triangles involving Node 29.

**Summing up the triangles:**
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
