Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9, respectively.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
