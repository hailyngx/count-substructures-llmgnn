Response:
Following the same procedure as demonstrated in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Triangle formed: <0, 11, 14>
    * Pair 2: (11, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (11, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (11, 6) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (11, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (14, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 7: (14, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 14, 4>
    * Pair 8: (14, 6) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 9: (14, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 10: (7, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 4>
    * Pair 11: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 12: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 13: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (10, 2) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (12, 2) -> No triangle formed
    
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed
    
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
