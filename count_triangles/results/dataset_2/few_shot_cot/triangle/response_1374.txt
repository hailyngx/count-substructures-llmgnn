Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
