Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2)
