Response:
This problem can be solved by counting the triangles formed by iterating over each node in the graph. Let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Nodes 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> Nodes 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> Nodes 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 3) -> Nodes 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 2) -> Nodes 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 3) -> Nodes 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 2) -> Nodes 7 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 1) -> Nodes 4 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 1) -> Nodes 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (9, 8) -> Nodes 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (9, 1) -> Nodes 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> Nodes 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> Nodes 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> Nodes 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> Nodes 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 0) -> Nodes 6 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 2) -> Nodes 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 0) -> Nodes 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 2) -> Nodes 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

I will continue this process for Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, and then provide the final answer.
