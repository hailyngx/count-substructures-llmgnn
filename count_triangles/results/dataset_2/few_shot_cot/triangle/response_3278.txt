Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (7, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 25) -> 6 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (6, 25) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 28) -> 6 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (10, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (10, 25) -> 10 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (10, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 20) -> 5 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (5, 20) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (19, 20) -> 19 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 4 to 29 in the graph.

Finally, sum up the total number of triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node to get the overall count.

[Total number of triangles in the graph is the sum of triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node]
