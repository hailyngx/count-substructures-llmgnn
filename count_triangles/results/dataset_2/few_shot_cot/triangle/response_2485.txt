Response:
Following the same instructions as in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) - Both 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) - Both 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (9, 2) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) - Both 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 6) - Both 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 2) - Both 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (7, 2) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) - Both 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) - Both 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) - Both 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (7, 1) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles can be formed with node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles can be formed with node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles can be formed with node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles can be formed with node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangles can be formed with node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
