Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 3) -> This pair was already considered in Pair 1 when analyzing Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> This pair was already considered in Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
