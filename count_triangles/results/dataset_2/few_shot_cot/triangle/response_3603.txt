Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 23) -> 4 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 23 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (23, 15) -> 23 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 23 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (16, 26) -> 16 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 16 and 26 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (23, 0) -> 23 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 23 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (23, 5) -> 23 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 23 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

The process should be continued for each remaining node in the graph to count the total number of triangles.
