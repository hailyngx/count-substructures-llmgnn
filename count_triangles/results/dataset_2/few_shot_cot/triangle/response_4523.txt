Response:
Let's begin by counting the triangles in the graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are connected, but 1 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are connected, but 1 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected, and 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are connected, and 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are connected, but 7 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 because it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected, and 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are connected, and 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are connected, but 0 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are connected, but 0 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are connected, but 0 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 because they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are connected, but 5 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14. Then sum up the total number of triangles in the graph. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
