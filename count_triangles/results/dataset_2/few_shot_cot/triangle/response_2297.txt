Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 14 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 14 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 13 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Remaining nodes do not have enough nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles so far:
* Total triangles found: 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 6

Now, let's continue checking for triangles in the remaining nodes.
