Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 6) -> 19 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 3) -> 12 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.

Summarizing the triangles found for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 11.
