Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 28) -> 16 and 28 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 12) -> 16 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 12) -> 28 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (21, 29) -> 21 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 2) -> 21 and 2 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (21, 9) -> 21 and 9 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (21, 29) -> 21 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 9) -> 21 and 9 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (22, 20) -> 22 and 20 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 8) -> 13 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 23) -> 13 and 23 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 23) -> 8 and 23 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (23, 14) -> 23 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (26, 23) -> 26 and 23 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (16, 29) -> 16 and 29 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 17) -> 16 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (29, 17) -> 29 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No connections to other nodes. Move to the next node.

* Node 8 to Node 29:
    * Continue the process for each of the remaining nodes.

After counting the triangles for all nodes, please provide the total number of triangles in the graph inside brackets [ ].
