* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 7). 
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    Follow the same process as above skipping pairs with smaller numbered nodes. 

After calculating the triangles for all nodes, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 10, 11>
<4, 11, 13>
<2, 7, 11>
<2, 11, 13>
<4, 13, 11>
<4, 13, 2>
<7, 11, 13>
