Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (18, 3) -> 18 and 3 are not connected because (18, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are not connected because (15, 17) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
