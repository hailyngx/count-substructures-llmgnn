Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as mentioned in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 20) -> 2 and 20 are not connected because (2, 20) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 21) -> 2 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 21 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 20) -> 6 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 20 are not connected as there is no edge (6, 20) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 21) -> 6 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 21 are not connected as there is no edge (6, 21) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (20, 21) -> 20 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 20 and 21 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (24, 28) -> 24 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 24 and 28 are not connected as there is no edge (24, 28) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (24, 29) -> 24 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 24 and 29 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (28, 29) -> 28 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 28 and 29 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 as per the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Let's continue this process for the remaining nodes and calculate the total number of triangles.
