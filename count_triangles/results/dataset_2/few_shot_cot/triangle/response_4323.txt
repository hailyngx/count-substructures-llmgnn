Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 0

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the initial example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are directly connected as (5, 2) is in the edge list. One side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are directly connected as (9, 4) is in the edge list. Triangle completed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are directly connected as (4, 3) is in the edge list. One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are directly connected as (4, 3) is in the edge list. One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) is in the edge list. One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are directly connected as (7, 6) is in the edge list. One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are directly connected as (4, 3) is in the edge list. One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 7) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are <4, 9, 0>, <4, 3, 7>, and <2, 3, 4>.

So, the final answer is [3].
