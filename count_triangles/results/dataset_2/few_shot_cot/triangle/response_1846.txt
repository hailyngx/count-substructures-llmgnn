    * No more pairs with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * Only one pair with Node 11, so no triangle formed.

    * No more pairs with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No pairs with Node 14.

Now that we have checked all nodes, let's count the total number of triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 17.

Therefore, there are [17] triangles in the given graph.
