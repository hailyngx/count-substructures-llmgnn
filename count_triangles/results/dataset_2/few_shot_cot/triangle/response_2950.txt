Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (11, 19) -> Directly connected as (0, 11), (0, 19) are in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (19, 6) -> 19 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 1) and (1, 9) are in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are directly connected as (9, 1) and (1, 16) are in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are directly connected as (6, 2) and (2, 15) are in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (9, 17) -> Directly connected as (3, 9) and (3, 17) are in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 19) -> Directly connected as (3, 9) and (3, 19) are in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (17, 19) -> Directly connected as (3, 17) and (3, 19) are in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (11, 1) -> Directly connected as (1, 4) and (4, 11) are in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (11, 17) -> Directly connected as (4, 11) and (4, 17) are in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (1, 17) -> Directly connected as (4, 1) and (1, 17) are in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

6. Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (14, 17) -> Directly connected as (6, 14) and (6, 17) are in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (11, 12) -> Directly connected as (7, 11) and (7, 12) are in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 18) -> Directly connected as (7, 18) and (7, 18) are in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

9. Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (10, 16) -> Directly connected as (8, 10) and (8, 16) are in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (17, 19) -> Directly connected as (9, 17) and (9, 19) are in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (17, 1) -> Directly connected as (9, 17) and (9, 1) are in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Add up the total triangles from each node: 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 16.

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.
