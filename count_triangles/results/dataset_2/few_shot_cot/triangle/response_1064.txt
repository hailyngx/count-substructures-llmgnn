Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, here are the triangles found for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 11) -> 12 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (12, 0) -> 12 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 6 to 19:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (13, 9) -> 13 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (9, 16) -> 9 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 16, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 9) + 3 (Node 4) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [10].
