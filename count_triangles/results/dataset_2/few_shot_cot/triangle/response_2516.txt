Response:
Following the same method as the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip 1-hop neighbors of Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Skip 1-hop neighbors of Nodes with smaller number.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip 1-hop neighbors with smaller numbered Nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip the 1-hop neighbor of Node 1 as it is smaller.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip 1-hop neighbors of Nodes with smaller number.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skipping pairs including smaller nodes.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
