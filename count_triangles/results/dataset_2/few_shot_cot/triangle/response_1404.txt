Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by going through each node step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (16, 11) -> 16 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (17, 7) -> 17 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 1: (17, 9) -> 17 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes for Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 14, and they are connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes for Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
