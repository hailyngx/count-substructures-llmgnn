Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 0) and (0, 18) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 18) -> 4 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (7, 1) and (1, 10) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (7, 1) and (1, 13) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (10, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 3) and (3, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (8, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (13, 17) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 6 to 19, and then sum up the total triangles found.

After following this process for all nodes, the answer is: [6]

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<3, 6, 9>
<0, 3, 18>
<1, 7, 10>
<1, 7, 13>
<2, 5, 8>
<5, 13, 17>.
