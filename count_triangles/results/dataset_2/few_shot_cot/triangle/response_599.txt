Response:
Following the pattern shown in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 21) -> 13 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 21) -> 14 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 29) -> 3 and 29 are not directly connected, even if they are 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 and 1 or with smaller nodes. No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 21) -> 1 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 25) -> 6 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continue this process for nodes 8 to 29.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (16, 28) -> 16 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (9, 22) -> 9 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (0, 23) -> 0 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (15, 29) -> 15 and 29 are not directly connected, even if they are 1-hop neighbors of 14. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (17, 27) -> 17 and 27 are not directly connected, even if they are 1-hop neighbors of 15. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (18, 27) -> 18 and 27 are not directly connected, even if they are 1-hop neighbors of 16. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skip any other pairs, as there are no nodes greater than 17.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18 to 29:
    * Skip all pairs as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
