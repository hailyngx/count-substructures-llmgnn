Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13)

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected because (1, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for all remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles.
