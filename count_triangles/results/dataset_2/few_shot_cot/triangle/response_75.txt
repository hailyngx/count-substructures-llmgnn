Response:
Following the same method as described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected as (3, 1, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected as (3, 1, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 1, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected as (4, 2, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are connected as (4, 13, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are connected as (7, 4, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected as (8, 4, 13) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are connected as (1, 8, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.

If you need the specific triangles found, they can be listed as follows:
<3, 1, 5>, <3, 1, 8>, <5, 1, 8>, <4, 2, 6>, <4, 7, 3>, <4, 13, 0>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 4, 13>, <8, 4, 13>, <1, 8, 4>.
