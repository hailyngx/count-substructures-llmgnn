Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> Both 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 13 are directly connected as (3, 13). Triangle formed: <2, 3, 13>.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 13 are directly connected as (9, 13). Triangle formed: <3, 9, 13>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. However, this triangle has been counted when considering Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
