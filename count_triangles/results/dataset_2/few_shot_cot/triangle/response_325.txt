Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 12) -> Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 12) shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (5, 0) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are directly connected as (1, 6) shown in the edge list. No additional triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (10, 11) -> Both 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 16) -> Both 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are directly connected as (0, 12) shown in the edge list. No additional triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are directly connected as (0, 12) shown in the edge list. No additional triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 13) -> Both 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (3, 13) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    - No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

* Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are directly connected as (1, 12) shown in the edge list. No additional triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 12:
    - No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 12 to form triangles.

* Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (3, 16) -> Both 3 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 14, Node 15:
    - No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 14 or 15 to form triangles.

* Node 16:
    - Pair 1: (5, 19) -> Both 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 17, Node 18, Node 19:
    - No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 17, 18, or 19 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
