Response:
Following the step-by-step method as described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (22, 23) --> 22 and 23 are connected to node 0 and are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (19, 20) --> Both 19 and 20 are directly connected to node 1 but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 8) --> Both 19 and 8 are directly connected to node 1 but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 8) --> Both 20 and 8 are directly connected to node 1 but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipped due to no pairs with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for nodes 3 to 29:

* Node 3: 0 triangles
* Node 4: 1 triangle
* Node 5: 0 triangles
* Node 6: 2 triangles
* Node 7: 0 triangles
* Node 8: 4 triangles
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 7 triangles
* Node 11: 1 triangle
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 2 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 2 triangles
* Node 18: 0 triangles
* Node 19: 1 triangle
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 4 triangles
* Node 22: 1 triangle
* Node 23: 1 triangle
* Node 24: 5 triangles
* Node 25: 0 triangles
* Node 26: 2 triangles
* Node 27: 3 triangles
* Node 28: 5 triangles
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Summing up the triangles from all nodes:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 4 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 7 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 2 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 2 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 4 (Node 21) + 1 (Node 22) + 1 (Node 23) + 5 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 2 (Node 26) + 3 (Node 27) + 5 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 39

Therefore, there are 39 triangles in the given graph. 
Hence, the answer is [39].
