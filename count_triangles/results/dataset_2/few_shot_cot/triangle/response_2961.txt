Response:
Following the process explained in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Not connected directly, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected. 
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected. 
    * Pair 4: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected. 
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected.
    * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected. 
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected. 
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected. 
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6 and connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, There are 5 triangles in the given graph.
