Response:
Following the provided instructions for counting triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0:  
    * Pair 1: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 3) and (0, 16) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (1, 4) and (1, 17) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 10) and (3, 17) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> 1 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (1, 17) shown in the edge list, but (1, 17) is already a part of a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node, so we skip this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Adding up all the triangles found for each node:

\[1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6\]

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
