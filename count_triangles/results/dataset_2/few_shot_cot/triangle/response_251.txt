Response:
Following the same approach as explained in the example above, let's identify the triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (5, 0) and (4, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 0) and (6, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No complete triangle found with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No complete triangle found with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No complete triangle found with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No complete triangle found with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No complete triangle found with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No complete triangle found with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No complete triangle found with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No complete triangle found with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No complete triangle found with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * No complete triangle found with Node 10.

* Node 11:
    * No complete triangle found with Node 11.

* Node 12:
    * No complete triangle found with Node 12.

* Node 13:
    * No complete triangle found with Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * No complete triangle found with Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, adding up the triangles found for each node:  
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
