Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example above to count the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 2 are connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 0 are connected directly. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Checking other nodes similarly.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
