Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 21) -> 8 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 28) -> 8 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
        - Now, looking for a third node connected to both 8 and 28. Node 14 is the only common neighbor.
            - Triangle found: <0, 8, 14>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 24) -> 5 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
        - Now, looking for a third node connected to both 5 and 24. Node 12 is the only common neighbor.
            - Triangle found: <1, 5, 12>
    * Pair 2: (1, 20) -> 1 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
        - Now, looking for a third node connected to both 1 and 12. Node 19 is the only common neighbor.
            - Triangle found: <1, 12, 19>

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (15, 28) -> 15 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected.
        - Now, looking for a third node connected to both 15 and 28. Node 3 is the only common neighbor.
            - Triangle found: <2, 15, 3>
    * Pair 2: (2, 29) -> 2 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 28) -> 2 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. 
        - Now, looking for a third node connected to both 2 and 28. Node 0 is the only common neighbor.
            - Triangle found: <2, 28, 0>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 24) -> 15 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
        - Now, looking for a third node connected to both 15 and 24. Node 4 is the only common neighbor.
            - Triangle found: <3, 15, 4>
    * Pair 2: (3, 28) -> 3 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
        - Now, looking for a third node connected to both 3 and 28. Node 2 is the only common neighbor.
            - Triangle found: <3, 28, 2>
    * Pair 3: (3, 24) -> 3 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
        - Now, looking for a third node connected to both 3 and 24. Node 11 is the only common neighbor.
            - Triangle found: <3, 24, 11>
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
        - Now, looking for a third node connected to both 3 and 5. Node 1 is the only common neighbor.
            - Triangle found: <3, 5, 1>

The process will continue for all nodes in the graph, and each unique triangle found will be listed. The final count will be provided in brackets [].

Let's continue this process for the entire graph to find all the triangles.
