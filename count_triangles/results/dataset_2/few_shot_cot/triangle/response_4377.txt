Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) - Skipped because the edge (8, 13) is not present.
    * Pair 2: (8, 18) - Skipped because the edge (8, 18) is not present.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) - Skipped because the edge (8, 6) is not present.
    * Pair 4: (13, 18) - Skipped because the edge (13, 18) is not present.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 16) - Skipped because the edge (4, 16) is not present.
    * Pair 2: (4, 17) - Skipped because the edge (4, 17) is not present.
    * Pair 3: (4, 11) - Skipped because the edge (4, 11) is not present.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) - Skipped because the edge (10, 19) is not present.
    * Pair 2: (10, 5) - Skipped because the edge (10, 5) is not present.
    * Pair 3: (10, 7) - Skipped because the edge (10, 7) is not present.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) - Skipped because the edge (5, 14) is not present.
    * Pair 5: (5, 13) - Skipped because the edge (5, 13) is not present.
    * Pair 6: (5, 16) - Skipped because the edge (5, 16) is not present.
    * Pair 7: (5, 2) - Skipped because the edge (5, 2) is not present.
    * Pair 8: (19, 12) - Skipped because the edge (19, 12) is not present.
    * Pair 9: (19, 6) - Skipped because the edge (19, 6) is not present.
    * Pair 10: (19, 0) - Skipped because the edge (19, 0) is not present.
    * Pair 11: (19, 18) - Skipped because the edge (19, 18) is not present.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) - Skipped because the edge (14, 16) is not present.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
