Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 1 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) -> Triangle formed as 9 and 4 are connected through node 14.
    * Pair 6: (9, 1) -> Triangle formed as 9 and 1 are connected through node 14.
    * Pair 7: (9, 8) -> Triangle formed as 9 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> Triangle formed as 7 and 2 are connected through node 12.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 11 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 14 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 10 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 0) -> Triangle formed as 7 and 0 are connected through node 1.
    * Pair 6: (2, 11) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 11 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (2, 14) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 14 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (12, 4) -> Triangle formed as 12 and 4 are connected through node 14.
    * Pair 2: (12, 14) -> No triangle formed as 12 and 14 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (13, 5) -> Triangle formed as 13 and 5 are connected through node 3.
    * Pair 2: (13, 7) -> Triangle formed as 13 and 7 are connected through node 1.
    * Pair 3: (13, 12) -> No triangle formed as 13 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 12 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Triangle formed as 13 and 14 are connected through node 4.
    * Pair 2: (13, 2) -> No triangle formed as 13 and 2 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:

* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 14.

Therefore, there are [14] triangles in the given graph.
