Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 27) -> 8 and 27 are directly connected to 0 and also to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected to 1 and also to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 23) -> 1 and 23 are directly connected to 1 but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are directly connected to 2 but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are directly connected to 2 but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 22) -> 2 and 22 are directly connected to 2 but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Both 3 and 15 are directly connected to each other but not to 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 29) -> Both 3 and 29 are directly connected to each other but not to 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected to 4 and also to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 20) -> 4 and 20 are directly connected to 4 but not to each other. No triangle formed.

Continuing the process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 5: 0 triangles
* Node 6: 0 triangles
* Node 7: 1 triangle
* Node 8: 1 triangle
* Node 9: 0 triangles
* Node 10: 0 triangles
* Node 11: 0 triangles
* Node 12: 0 triangles
* Node 13: 0 triangles
* Node 14: 0 triangles
* Node 15: 0 triangles
* Node 16: 0 triangles
* Node 17: 0 triangles
* Node 18: 1 triangle
* Node 19: 0 triangles
* Node 20: 0 triangles
* Node 21: 0 triangles
* Node 22: 0 triangles
* Node 23: 1 triangle
* Node 24: 0 triangles
* Node 25: 0 triangles
* Node 26: 0 triangles
* Node 27: 0 triangles
* Node 28: 0 triangles
* Node 29: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: [5]
* Unique triangles: <1, 4, 7>, <0, 8, 27>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 23, 7>, <2, 18, 22>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
