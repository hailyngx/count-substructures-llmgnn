Response:
Following the same process as the example provided for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> 6 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 17) -> 10 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 10 and 17 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 since they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 since they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 since they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 5. No more nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 7. No more nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 to 19:
    * Skip all pairs involving these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8 to 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
