Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> Both 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 15) -> Both 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 13) -> Both 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 15) -> Both 6 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 15) -> Both 13 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 15) -> Both 8 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 8, 15>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 18) -> Both 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 18) -> Both 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> Both 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> Both 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes (0, 1, 2).
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 9, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (9, 15) -> Both 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 15) -> Both 4 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Proceeding in a similar manner for the remaining nodes:

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5 to 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total number of triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
