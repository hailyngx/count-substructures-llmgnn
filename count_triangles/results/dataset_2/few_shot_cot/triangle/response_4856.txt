Response:
Following the method used in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Remaining pairs are not valid for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Remaining pairs are not valid for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Remaining pairs are not valid for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Remaining pairs are not valid for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Remaining pairs are not valid for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Potential triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Remaining pairs are not valid for triangle formation.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<1, 2, 7> and <1, 5, 7>)

Continuing this process for Nodes 6 through 14:

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
