Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example above, I will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected (5, 14). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 29) -> 5 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 29) -> 14 and 29 are not connected as (14, 29) does not exist. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other pair to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected (7, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected (19, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected (10, 13). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> 14 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 29) -> 14 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 29) -> 18 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (19, 23) -> 19 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected (19, 23). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 29) -> 19 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected (19, 29). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (23, 29) -> 23 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 27) -> 10 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 11) -> 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected (2, 11). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

I will continue this process for the remaining nodes and calculate the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed.
