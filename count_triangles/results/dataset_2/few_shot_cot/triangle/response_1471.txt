Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 17 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (17, 13) -> 17 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 13) -> 17 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (18, 15) -> 18 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 18 and 15 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (18, 11) -> 18 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 18 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (19, 13) -> 19 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (17, 15) -> 17 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (16, 13) -> 16 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (16, 14) -> 16 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 14, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (17, 12) -> 17 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as they are either not part of any triangle formation or nodes with no valid pairs to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
