Response:
Following the process described in the example provided with step-by-step explanations for each node in the graph, here are the triangles found:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are not connected because (5, 16) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) - > 5 and 4 are connected in the edge list as (0, 5), forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 15) -> 6 and 15 are connected in the edge list forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as one of the vertices (not connected to any other nodes).
