Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8)

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
