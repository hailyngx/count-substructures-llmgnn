Response:
Following the step-by-step method described in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 10) -> 15 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 18) -> 3 and 18 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 16) -> 17 and 16 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (19, 11) -> 19 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 17) -> 19 and 17 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * These nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
