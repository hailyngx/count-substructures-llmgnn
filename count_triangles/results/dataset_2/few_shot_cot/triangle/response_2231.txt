Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's find the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) - 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) - 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) - 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (8, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
