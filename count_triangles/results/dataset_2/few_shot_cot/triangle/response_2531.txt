Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the first example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected. Formed a triangle <0, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it's smaller.
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
