Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (19, 9) -> 19 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (17, 4) -> 17 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 15) -> 17 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 5) -> 17 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (15, 5) -> 15 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs because any node involved in a pair is smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

 Continue the process for the other nodes.
