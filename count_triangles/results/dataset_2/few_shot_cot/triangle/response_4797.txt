Response:
Let's start counting the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 2 are also connected as (5, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 1 are also connected as (5, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are connected directly. Find 3rd node for a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 2 are also connected as (8, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 12 are also connected as (8, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected directly. Find the 3rd node for a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 2 and 9 are also directly connected as (2, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 2 and 1 are also directly connected as (2, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are already connected directly. Find the 3rd node for a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Great! Let's continue on finding triangles for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, and sum them up for the final answer.
