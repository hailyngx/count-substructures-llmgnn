Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 14 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 14 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 16 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 8 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 11 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 13 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (11, 18) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (19, 2) -> 19 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 19 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Moving on to Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, and other subsequent nodes to find all the triangles in the given graph.
