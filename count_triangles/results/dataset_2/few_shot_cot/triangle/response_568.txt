Response:
Following the same method as the example, let's count the triangles in this graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7:
    - Skipped as they have other nodes smaller than them.

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
