Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 6, 18>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 18, 19>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed <1, 5, 14>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed <1, 6, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed <2, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed <3, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6:
    * Skipped because we have already considered them in the previous steps.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (13, 8) -> 13 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected. Triangle formed <7, 8, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, and 10:
    * Skipped because we have already considered them in the previous steps.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (16, 14) -> 16 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 11, and they are also connected. Triangle formed <11, 14, 16>.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12 and Node 13:
    * Skipped, as they have smaller adjacent nodes.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 15, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 16, and they are also connected. Triangle formed <11, 16, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped, as they have smaller adjacent nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) = 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
