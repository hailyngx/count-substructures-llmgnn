Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 12) - 2 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) - 4 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) - 5 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - 9 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) - 7 and 10 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) - 7 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) - 7 and 6 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) - 7 and 1 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) - 8 and 14 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 11) - 8 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - 9 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) - 9 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) - 9 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) - 9 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 13) - 12 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
