Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, 6, 9, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, 0, and node 3

Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, I will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Connected through Node 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) - Connected through Node 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Connected through Node 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Connected through Node 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Connected through Node 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) - Connected through Node 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Connected through Node 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) - Connected through Node 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Connected through Node 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Connected through Node 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Connected through Node 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
