Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 19) -> Both 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 19) -> Both 9 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (including <3, 9, 19>)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 18) -> 8 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 19) -> 18 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. 
    * Pair 1: (16, 7) -> 16 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 9) -> 16 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 10) -> 16 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6: 
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * Pair 1: (18, 17) -> 18 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are not directly connected. No triangle formed. 
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than their values.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4] <1, 11, 13>, <2, 11, 19>, <3, 9, 19>, <4, 8, 18>.
