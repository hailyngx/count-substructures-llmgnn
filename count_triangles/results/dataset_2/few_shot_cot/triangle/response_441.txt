Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed as 2 and 4 are connected, and 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles for Node 2: <2, 4, 8>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> Triangle formed as 4 and 2 are connected, and 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles for Node 4: <2, 4, 9>

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 0 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
