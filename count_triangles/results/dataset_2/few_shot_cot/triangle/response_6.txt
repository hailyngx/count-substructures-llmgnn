Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs, no other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
