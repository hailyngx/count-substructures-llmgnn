Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (3, 26) -> Forms a triangle with Node 26.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

3. **Node 2:**
    - Pair 1: (11, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

5. **Node 4:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

6. **Node 5:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

7. **Node 6:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

8. **Node 7:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

9. **Node 8:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

10. **Node 9:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

11. **Node 10:**
    - Pair 1: (20, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

12. **Node 11:**
    - No new triangles can be formed.

13. **Node 12:**
    - Pair 1: (18, 23) -> Forms a triangle with Node 18.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

14. **Node 13:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

15. **Node 14:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

16. **Node 15:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

17. **Node 16:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

18. **Node 17:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

19. **Node 18:**
    - Pair 1: (6, 21) -> Forms a triangle with Node 21.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

20. **Node 19:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

21. **Node 20:**
    - No new triangles can be formed.

22. **Node 21:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

23. **Node 22:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

24. **Node 23:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

25. **Node 24:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

26. **Node 25:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

27. **Node 26:**
    - No new triangles can be formed.

28. **Node 27:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

29. **Node 28:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

30. **Node 29:**
    - No triangles can be formed.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 18) = 5

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 26, 0>
<2, 11, 6>
<10, 11, 20>
<12, 18, 23>
<18, 21, 6>
