Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 or Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
