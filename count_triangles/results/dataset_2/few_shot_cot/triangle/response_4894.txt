Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the initial example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 3) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (9, 4) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (9, 7)  - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (9, 3) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 6) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 6) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) - Not a triangle, as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0-4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue with Nodes 6 to 9 to make sure none of them form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
