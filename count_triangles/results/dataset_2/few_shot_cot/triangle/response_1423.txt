Response:
Following the step-by-step process as outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 2) and (8, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip Pair 1 with Node 1 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are <2, 3, 8>, <4, 6, 14>, and <1, 4, 14>.

The final answer is [3].
