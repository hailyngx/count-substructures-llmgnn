Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No triangle formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> 8 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * No triangle formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangle formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * No triangle formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * No triangle formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 18:
    * No triangle formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * No triangle formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
