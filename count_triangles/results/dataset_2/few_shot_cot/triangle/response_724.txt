Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - 1 and 5 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 9.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 9.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) - 1 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 5: (1, 3) - 1 and 3 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (2, 13) - 2 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) - 3 and 12 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) - 6 and 10 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) - 6 and 3 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) - 7 and 10 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph. [12]
