Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 has only one neighbor and cannot form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Node 4 only has one 1-hop neighbor. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller. 
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 but not connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Node 6 only has one 1-hop neighbor. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller. 
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 but not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 but not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7 and connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to not fulfilling the requirements to form triangles.

* Node 10:
    * Skipped pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller.
    * Node 10 forms no triangles.

* Node 11 and Node 12:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 13:
    * Skipped pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Node 13 won't form any triangles.

* Node 14:
    * Node 14 does not form any triangles.

* Node 15:
    * Node 15 will not form any triangles.

* Node 16 and Node 17:
    * Skipped due to not satisfying the conditions to build triangles.

* Node 18:
    * Node 18 cannot form any triangles.

* Node 19:
    * Node 19 does not contribute to any triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
