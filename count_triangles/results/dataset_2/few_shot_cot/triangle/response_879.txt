Response:
Following the same process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> Both 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 3) -> Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 3 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 0) -> Both 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 0 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> Both 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 1) -> Both 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 1 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 0) -> Both 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 14) -> Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 1) -> Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 1 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (14, 1) -> Both 14 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 14 and 1 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 2 to form a triangle.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Both 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 1 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.

    * Pair 4: (9, 1) -> Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 1 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> Both 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 4: (7, 2) -> Both 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 7 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 0) -> Both 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 0 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Continuing this process for Nodes 5 through 14:
    * Node 5: 1 triangle
    * Node 6: 1 triangle
    * Node 7: 2 triangles
    * Node 8: 2 triangles
    * Node 9: 3 triangles
