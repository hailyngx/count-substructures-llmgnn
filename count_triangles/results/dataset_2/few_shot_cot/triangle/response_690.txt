Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are directly connected as (12, 15) in the edge list and also 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are directly connected as (12, 0) and (0, 6) in the edge list and also 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 6) -> 15 and 6 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are directly connected as (1, 8) in the edge list and also 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. Triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 2 for triangle formation.

    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:

    * Pair 3: (9, 27) -> 9 and 27 are directly connected as (9, 27) in the edge list but are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 10-29:
    * Skipping analysis for Nodes 10 to 29 as there aren't at least two nodes greater than them for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 14

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
