Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (12, 22) -> Nodes 12 and 22 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (1, 18) -> Nodes 1 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (2, 24) -> Nodes 2 and 24 are connected.
  * Pair 2: (2, 28) -> Nodes 2 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> Nodes 2 and 5 are connected.
  * Pair 4: (2, 25) -> Nodes 2 and 25 are connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (3, 22) -> Nodes 3 and 22 are connected.
  * Pair 2: (3, 29) -> Nodes 3 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Nodes 3 and 4 are connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> Nodes 4 and 1 are connected.
  * Pair 2: (4, 19) -> Nodes 4 and 19 are connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> Nodes 5 and 15 are connected.
  * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Nodes 5 and 12 are connected.
  * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> Nodes 5 and 2 are connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> Nodes 6 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> Nodes 7 and 13 are connected.
  * Pair 2: (7, 15) -> Nodes 7 and 15 are connected.
  * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> Nodes 7 and 12 are connected.
  * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 8:
  * Pair 1: (8, 23) -> Nodes 8 and 23 are connected.
  * Pair 2: (8, 20) -> Nodes 8 and 20 are connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
  * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> Nodes 9 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (9, 19) -> Nodes 9 and 19 are connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
  * No triangle possible with only one connection.
  * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 11, 12, and 13:
  * Skipping as already covered when counting triangles starting from Nodes 0 to 10 to avoid repetition.

Given the adjacency list and edge list, continue the process as demonstrated for the remaining nodes. Once you finish counting for all nodes, add up the totals to find the overall number of triangles in the graph. Provide the final count inside brackets [].
