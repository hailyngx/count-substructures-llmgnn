Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected as (2, 6) in the edge list. But 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are connected as (14, 17) in the edge list. But 14 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are connected as (7, 17) in the edge list. But 7 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 because they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are connected as (6, 14) in the edge list. But 6 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are connected as (1, 12) in the edge list. But 1 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are connected as (4, 17) in the edge list. But 4 and 17 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as there is only one node connected to Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 9,
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> 11 and 18 are connected as (11, 18) in the edge list. But 11 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No possible triangles with Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No possible triangles with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No possible triangles with Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to consider as there are only three nodes connected to Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No pairs to consider as there are only three nodes connected to Node 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
