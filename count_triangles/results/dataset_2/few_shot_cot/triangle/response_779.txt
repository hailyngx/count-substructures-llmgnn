Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

- Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (14, 7) -> 14 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 14 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (14, 8) -> 14 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 14 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 14 and 17 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (14, 4) -> 14 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 14 and 17 are also connected. As they are directly connected, triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (14, 4) -> 14 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 14 and 4 are also connected. As they are directly connected, triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (14, 3) -> 14 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no other nodes connected to it.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 14 are also connected. As they are directly connected, triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
  * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> 12 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
  * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (14, 10) -> 14 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
  * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
