Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will count the triangles in the provided graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Form a triangle with Node 4 and Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1**:
    - Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 7 and Node 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2**:
    - Pair 1: (9, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 9 and Node 12.
    - Pair 2: (9, 13) -> Form a triangle with Node 9 and Node 13.
    - Pair 3: (12, 13) -> Form a triangle with Node 12 and Node 13.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

4. **Node 3**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no connected nodes greater than Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4**:
    - Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 and Node 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5**:
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as all other connected nodes are smaller than Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no connected nodes greater than Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7**:
    - Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 8 and Node 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. **Node 8**:
    - Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 and Node 13.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. **Node 9**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 4 and Node 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

11. **Node 10**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Form a triangle with Node 4 and Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

12. **Node 11**:
    - Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 and Node 12.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

13. **Node 12**:
    - Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Form a triangle with Node 13 and Node 14.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

14. **Node 13**:
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 13 as all other connected nodes are smaller than Node 13.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. **Node 14**:
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 14 as all other connected nodes are smaller than Node 14.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1+1+3+0+1+0+0+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
