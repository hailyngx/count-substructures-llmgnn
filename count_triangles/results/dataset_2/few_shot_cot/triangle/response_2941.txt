Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided above, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skipped as there is only one neighbor.

* Node 9:
    * Skipped any pairs that involve Node 8 (only 1 neighbor) or smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * Skipped as each only has at most 2 neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) = 6.

Therefore, **the number of triangles in the given graph is [6]**.
