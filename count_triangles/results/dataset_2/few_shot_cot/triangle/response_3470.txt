Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 11 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 7) -> 11 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 11 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 11 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 11 and 12 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are both smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
