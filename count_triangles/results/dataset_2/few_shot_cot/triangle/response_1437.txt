Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the provided information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Continue the process for Nodes 6 to 19 following the same procedure and skipping any pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = [9].
* Unique triangles: <2, 4, 5>, <3, 6, 18>, <4, 5, 19>, <0, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 12, 15>, <3, 8, 14>, <8, 9, 17>, <13, 16, 17>.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles are as shown above.
