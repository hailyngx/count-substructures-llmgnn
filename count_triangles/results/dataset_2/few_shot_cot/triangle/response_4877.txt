    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed.
