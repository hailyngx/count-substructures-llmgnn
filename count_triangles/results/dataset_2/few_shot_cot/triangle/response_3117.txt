Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
