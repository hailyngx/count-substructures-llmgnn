Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 17) -> 9 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 17 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 17 and 18 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 2 or larger numbers, as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 6 to 19, and calculate the total number of triangles.

[Total number of triangles in the graph: 19]
