Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 11 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 11 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed since 7 and 11 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * The connections from Node 1 do not form any triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * The connections from Node 2 do not form any triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 10 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed since 7 and 10 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4 since they have already been counted.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed since 7 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> Triangle formed with nodes 7, 8, and 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (formed by nodes 7, 8, and 11).

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Similar to the approach in the example, we skip counting triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node since there are no nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
