Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) - 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip Pair 1: Includes Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) - 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) - 4 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) - 0 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) - 1 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) - 10 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) - 8 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Other nodes) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
