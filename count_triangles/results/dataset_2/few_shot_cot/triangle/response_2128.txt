Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.

        * Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
            * Skipped because there aren't at least two nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

        Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
