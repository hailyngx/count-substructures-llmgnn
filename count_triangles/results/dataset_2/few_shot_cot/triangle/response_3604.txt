Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) - 12 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 28) - 12 and 28 are not directly connected as there is no edge (12, 28) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 28) - 15 and 28 are not directly connected as there is no edge (15, 28) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 15) - 4 and 15 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 15) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 25) - 4 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge that directly connects them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (18, 22) - 18 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (18, 25) - 18 and 25 are not directly connected as there is no edge (18, 25) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (22, 25) - 22 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge that directly connects them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (20, 21) - 20 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 26) - 21 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge that directly connects them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) - 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) - 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 22) - 14 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (17, 26) - 17 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 15) - 1 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for all nodes...

[<1, 4, 9>, <6, 7, 14>, <7, 14, 22>, <9, 15, 1>, <12, 15, 28>, <18, 22, 2>] 

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. [6]
