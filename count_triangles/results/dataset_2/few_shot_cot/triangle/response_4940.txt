Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (28, 29) -> Both 28 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3 - Node 14:
    * Skipping nodes 3 to 14 as they don't form triangles with 2 other larger nodes.

* Node 15:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 29) -> 6 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 15, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 16, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.

* Node 18:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (18, 29) -> 18 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 18, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19 - Node 26:
    * Skipping nodes 19 to 26 as they don't form triangles with 2 other larger nodes.

* Node 27:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 27, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 28:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 28, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 29:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> 0 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 29, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 5

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
