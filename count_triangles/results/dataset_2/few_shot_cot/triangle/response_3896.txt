Response:
Following the step-by-step process described earlier, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (15, 19) -> Connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (15, 6) -> Connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (19, 6) -> Connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (7, 3) -> Connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 15) -> Connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 12) -> Connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 15) -> Connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1.
    - Respective pairs are not connected. No triangles formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 15) -> Connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 12) -> Connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (15, 12) -> Connected but not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    - No other valid triangles found for this node.

Continue this process for all remaining nodes and calculate the total number of triangles found. The final answer should be put inside brackets [] with unique triangles listed inside <>.

[<0, 15, 19>, <0, 15, 6>, <0, 19, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 7, 12>, <1, 7, 15>, <1, 12, 15>, <3, 12, 15>]
