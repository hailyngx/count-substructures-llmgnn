Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 22) -> 1 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 22 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 16) -> 0 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 16 are also connected as (0, 1, 16) shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 0 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 22) -> 0 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 22 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (9, 19) -> 9 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 25) -> 9 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 25 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 20) -> 6 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 11 and 19 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (23, 18) -> 23 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 18 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 20) -> 3 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 20 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (14, 17) -> 14 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (9, 28) -> 9 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (10, 27) -> 10 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 10 and 27 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (12, 27) -> 12 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

I will continue this process for the remaining nodes and provide the final count of triangles within brackets at the end. Let's proceed.
