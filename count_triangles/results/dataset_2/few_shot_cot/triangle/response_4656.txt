Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (12, 9) -> 12 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    - Since these nodes have at most one or no pairs that can form a triangle, we directly skip to the final count.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

Output the final answer inside brackets []: [3].
