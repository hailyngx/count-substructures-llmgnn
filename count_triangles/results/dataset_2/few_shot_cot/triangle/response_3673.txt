* Node 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * These nodes will be skipped as there are no pairs greater than their number to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 5 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 17.

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [17].
