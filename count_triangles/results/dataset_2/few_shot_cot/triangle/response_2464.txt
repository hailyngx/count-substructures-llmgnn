Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not connected (1, 3) is missing in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (0, 1). 
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (0, 3).

    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected (1, 8) is missing in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected (8, 4) is missing in the edge list. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not connected (1, 4) is missing in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (0, 3). 
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (3, 9). 
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (3, 7). 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not connected (1, 8) is missing in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (4, 8). 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but not connected (0, 7) is missing in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (2, 6). 
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but not connected (3, 9) is missing in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (7, 4). 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as there aren't enough nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [6].
