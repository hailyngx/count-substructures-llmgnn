* Skipping Nodes 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29 as they have smaller numbered nodes to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles observed:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 3 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 23) + 3 (Node 24) = 21.

Therefore, there are 21 triangles in the given graph.
