Response:
Following the step-by-step process demonstrated in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 24) -> 6 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 24) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs are possible for Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible pairs for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs involving Node 0 or Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs are possible for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pairs 1, 2, and 3 alongside the corresponding edges for each pair result in isolated triangles.
      <3, 15, 21>, <3, 15, 16>, <3, 15, 18>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 due to smaller node numbers.
    * No possible pairs for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7:
    * Process skipped due to the absence of at least 2 nodes larger than each of these nodes.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 23) -> 8 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as (8, 23) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs are possible for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No possible pairs for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No possible pairs for Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest node: 0

* Nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Process skipped due to the absence of at least 2 nodes larger than each of these nodes.

* Node 15:
    * No possible pairs for Node 15.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest node: 0

* Nodes 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Process skipped due to the absence of at least 2 nodes larger than each of these nodes.

* Node 20:
    * No possible pairs for Node 20.
    * Total triangles with Node 20 as the smallest node: 0

* Nodes 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
    * Process skipped due to the absence of at least 2 nodes larger than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 8) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
