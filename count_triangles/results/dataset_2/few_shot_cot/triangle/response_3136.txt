Response:
Following the method provided in the example above, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 27) -> Triangle formed with Node 26 as (15, 27) and (15, 26) are in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (15, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (27, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (27, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as Node 2 has no pairs to form triangles with.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (28, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (28, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (29, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (16, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (16, 24) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 25) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 as (16, 25) and (16, 5) are in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (24, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 23) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 20) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 as (9, 20) and (9, 6) are in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (23, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 7 to 29...

* Node 7: 0 triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 8: Skipped as Node 8 doesn't have enough pairs to form triangles.
* Node 9: 1 triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 10: 0 triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 11: 1 triangle with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 12: 0 triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 13: Skipped as Node 13 doesn't have enough pairs to form triangles.
* Node 14: 1 triangle with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 15: 1 triangle with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 16: 0 triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 17: 1 triangle with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 18: 0 triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 19: 1 triangle with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 20: 0 triangles with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 21: 0 triangles with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 22: Skipped as Node 22 doesn't have enough pairs to form triangles.
* Node 23: 0 triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 24: 0 triangles with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 25: 1 triangle with Node 25 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 26: 1 triangle with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 27: 0 triangles with Node 27 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 28: 0 triangles with Node 28 as the smallest numbered node
* Node 29: 0 triangles with Node 29 as the smallest numbered node

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [8].
