Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above to count the triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> Both 8 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> Both 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 2) -> Both 16 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (18, 2) -> Both 18 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No new triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip nodes smaller than 4.
    * No new triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5, 6, 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered nodes.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 20) -> Both 9 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No new triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip nodes smaller than 10.
    * No new triangles formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * Skip smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16, 17, 18:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered nodes.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 20, 21:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered nodes.

* Node 22:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 23:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 24, 25:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered nodes.

* Node 26:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 26 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 27, 28, 29:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: [2]

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph: <8, 2, 16> and <1, 2, 18>.
