Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's now find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:  
    - Pair 1: (5, 2) - Both 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 13) - Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 11) - Both 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 11) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 13) - Both 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 11) - Both 2 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (13, 11) - Both 13 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. **Node 1**:

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:  
Total triangles = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 2 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <5, 2, 0>, <6, 11, 5>, <12, 1, 4>, and <12, 1, 5>.
