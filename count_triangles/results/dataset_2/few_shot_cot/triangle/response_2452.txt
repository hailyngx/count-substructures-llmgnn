Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:


* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Connected as (2, 5), forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Connected as (3, 7), forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Connected as (4, 5), forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Connected as (4, 6), forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0


Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
