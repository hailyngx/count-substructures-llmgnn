    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1
<8, 9, 4>

* Node 9 and Node 10:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 9 or 10.

* Node 11:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 13), but both are smaller than 11, so this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
