Response:
Following the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are directly connected as (9, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are directly connected as (6, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as nodes smaller than 7 are considered in previous steps.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
