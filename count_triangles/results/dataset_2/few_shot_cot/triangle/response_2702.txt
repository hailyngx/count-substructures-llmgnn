Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Skipping nodes smaller than Node 0.
    - Pairs: (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 12), (0, 19), (0, 29) - No triangles found.
    - Total triangles with Node 0: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Skipping nodes smaller than Node 1.
    - Pairs: (1, 22), (1, 4), (1, 24), (1, 25) - No triangles found.
    - Total triangles with Node 1: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Pairs: (2, 17), (2, 0) - No triangles found.
    - Total triangles with Node 2: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pairs: (3, 15), (3, 22), (3, 10) - Triangle <3, 15, 10> found.
    - Total triangles with Node 3: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Pairs: (4, 16), (4, 18), (4, 14), (4, 1) - No triangles found.
    - Total triangles with Node 4: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skipping nodes smaller than Node 5.
    - Pairs: (5, 22), (5, 21) - No triangles found.
    - Total triangles with Node 5: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Pairs: (6, 0), (6, 17), (6, 23), (6, 27) - Triangle <6, 0, 27> found. Triangle <6, 17, 2> found.
    - Total triangles with Node 6: 2

8. Node 7:
    - Pairs: (7, 15), (7, 8), (7, 23) - Triangle <7, 15, 23> found.
    - Total triangles with Node 7: 1

9. Node 8:
    - Pairs: (8, 7), (8, 28) - No triangles found.
    - Total triangles with Node 8: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Skipping nodes smaller than Node 9.
    - No pairs to form triangles with Node 9.

11. Continue this process for Nodes 10 to 29.

After counting triangles for all nodes:

Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
