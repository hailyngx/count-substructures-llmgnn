Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 5, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Triangle <0, 4, 5> formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (5, 2) -> Triangle <0, 2, 5> formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph, which are <0, 4, 5> and <0, 2, 5>.
