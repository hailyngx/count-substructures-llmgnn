Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 1 are connected as (4, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 4 are connected as (0, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 5 are connected as (0, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 1 are connected as (0, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> Both 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 2 are connected as (5, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 6 are connected as (2, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4 and 5:
    * Were previously covered in the analysis of other nodes.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> Both 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 10

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
