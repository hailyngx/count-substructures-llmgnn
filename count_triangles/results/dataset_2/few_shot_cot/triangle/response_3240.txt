Response:
Following the same procedure as described in the example above, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are connected. No other common neighbor with 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are connected. No other common neighbor with 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are connected. No other common neighbor with 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. No other common neighbor with 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are connected. No other common neighbor with 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are connected. No other common neighbor with 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are connected. No other common neighbor with 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected. No other common neighbor with 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
