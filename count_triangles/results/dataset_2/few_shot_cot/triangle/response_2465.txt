Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 8 and 12 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 12 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 11) -> Both 13 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 13 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 5) -> Both 13 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 13 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 2) -> Both 13 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 13 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (13, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 7), but since 6 and 7 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 10) -> Both 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 10 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 10) -> Both 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 10 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 10) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (10, 8) -> Both 10 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 10 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Let's continue this process for nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to find the total number of triangles in the graph.
