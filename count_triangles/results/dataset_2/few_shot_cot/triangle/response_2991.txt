Response:
Following the steps from the example provided:

1. **Node 0**:
    * Pair 1: (14, 21) -> 14 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (19, 21) -> 19 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (14, 19) -> 14 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. **Node 1**:
    * Pair 1: (21, 28) -> 21 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Nodes 1 and 5 are directly connected in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 21.
    * Pair 3: (5, 21) -> Skip as it was already counted above.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2**:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3**:
    * Pair 1: (23, 24) -> 23 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (23, 25) -> Nodes 23 and 25 are directly connected in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (24, 25) -> Skip as this triangle was already counted.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4**:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5**:
    * Pair 1: (1, 25) -> Nodes 1 and 25 are directly connected in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 5.

    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

8. **Node 7**:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no other connected nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8**:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Pair 2: (10, 19) -> Nodes 10 and 19 are directly connected in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 23.
    * Pair 3: (10, 23) -> Nodes 10 and 23 are directly connected in the edge list, forming a triangle with Node 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 3

12. **Node 11**:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

13. **Node 12**: 0 triangles
14. **Node 13**: 0 triangles
15. **Node 14**: 0 triangles
16. **Node 15**: 0 triangles
17. **Node 16**: 0 triangles
18. **Node 17**: 0 triangles
19. **Node 18**: 0 triangles
20. **Node 19**: 0 triangles
21. **Node 20**: 0 triangles
22. **Node 21**: 1 triangle
23. **Node 22**: 0 triangles
24. **Node 23**: 2 triangles
25. **Node 24**: 0 triangles
26. **Node 25**: 1 triangle
27. **Node 26**: 0 triangles
28. **Node 27**: 0 triangles
29. **Node 28**: 0 triangles
30. **Node 29**: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 + 1 (Node 3) + 0 + 1 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 21) + 0 + 2 (Node 23) + 0 + 1 (Node 25) + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
