Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- For Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are directly connected as (6, 5) shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are directly connected as (8, 5) shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 6: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- For Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are directly connected as (4, 2) shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are directly connected as (2, 5) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- For Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are directly connected as (7, 5) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- For Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are directly connected as (9, 10) shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- For Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- For Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- For Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- For Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Continue the same process for Nodes 8 to 14 to find triangles formed.

By following the steps provided for each node, count the total number of triangles formed and provide the final answer inside brackets [].
