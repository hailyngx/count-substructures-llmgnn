Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 16) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (13, 14). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (13, 4) -> 13 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (13, 4). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19: Skip all pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: [1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, which is <13, 14, 0>.
