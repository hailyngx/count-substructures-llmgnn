Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
  * Skipped since there are no pairs to form triangles with nodes greater than 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
