Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle <0, 1, 4> formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 18) -> Nodes 1 and 18 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 19) -> Nodes 1 and 19 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 18) -> Nodes 4 and 18 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 19) -> Triangle <0, 4, 19> formed.
    * Pair 6: (18, 19) -> Triangle <0, 18, 19> formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Nodes 9 and 11 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as all other nodes connected to Node 2 are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as all other nodes connected to Node 3 are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Nodes 10 and 14 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 19) -> Nodes 10 and 19 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 19) -> Triangle <4, 14, 19> formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 5 to 19:
