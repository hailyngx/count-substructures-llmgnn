Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the provided example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 22) -> 1 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (10, 22) -> 10 and 22 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 26) -> 0 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 26) -> 2 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (1, 25) -> 1 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 24) -> 1 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (24, 25) -> 24 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (22, 4) -> 22 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (22, 14) -> 22 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11:
    - The pairs for these nodes are skipped as there are no other nodes greater than them to form triangles.

6. Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (10, 22) -> 10 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (10, 8) -> 10 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (22, 8) -> 22 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Nodes 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18:
    - The pairs for these nodes are skipped as there are no other nodes greater than them to form triangles.

8. Node 19:
    - Pair 1: (10, 26) -> 10 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 19, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Nodes 20, 27, 28, 29:
    - The pairs for these nodes are skipped as there are no other nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 12) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
