Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process demonstrated in the example:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 4) - Triangle formed: <3, 5, 4>
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (1, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * The pairs involving Node 0 and 1 are skipped due to smaller node numbers.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
* Node 6:
    * The pairs involving Node 0, 1, and 2 are skipped due to smaller node numbers.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are skipped due to smaller node numbers.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * The pairs involving all other nodes are skipped due to smaller node numbers.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8 or Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
