Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs available to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs available to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs available to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs available to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs available to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs available to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs available to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs available to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs available to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 9. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs available to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
