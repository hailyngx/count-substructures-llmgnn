Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <0, 4, 7>
    - Pair 2: (4, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <0, 4, 2>
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <1, 9, 8>
    - Pair 2: (9, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <1, 9, 2>
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. **Node 2:**
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 4, 9>
    - Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <2, 9, 7>
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (7, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <1, 7, 6>
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
    - No pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
    - No pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No other nodes to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - No pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, [7] triangles exist in the given graph.
