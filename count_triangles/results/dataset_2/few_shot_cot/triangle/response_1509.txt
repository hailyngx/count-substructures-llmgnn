Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 19) -> No triangle formed since 6 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> No triangle formed since 8 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed since 8 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed since 8 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed since 8 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (17, 7) -> No triangle formed since 17 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (17, 12) -> No triangle formed since 17 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed since 7 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * The connections of Node 2 don't form any triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10:
    * None of these nodes have connections to form triangles.

* Node 11:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> No triangle formed since 16 and 18 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 17, 18, 19:
    * None of these nodes have connections to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
