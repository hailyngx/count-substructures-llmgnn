Response:
Following the step-by-step approach, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (9, 27) -> Forms a triangle with 27 as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 12) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (9, 10) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - No possible triangles with larger-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
