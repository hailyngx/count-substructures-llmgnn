Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed since 7 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed since 7 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (14, 2) -> No triangle formed since 14 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are connected. Check if 12 and 4 are connected.
        * Pair 2.1: (12, 4) -> Triangle formed <1, 7, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (17, 0) -> No triangle formed since 17 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (17, 8) -> 17 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed since 0 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Both 6 and 11 are connected, but 6 and 11 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 16) -> both 6 and 16 are connected, but 6 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> Both 6 and 13 are connected, but 6 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 5) -> Triangle formed <3, 6, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (17, 12) -> Triangle formed <4, 17, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (14, 8) -> 14 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 13) -> 14 and 13 are connected, but 14 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected, but 8 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (16, 1) -> No triangle formed since 16 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> Triangle formed <5, 8, 13>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be considered as there are no nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
