Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - Forms a triangle with Node 11. Triangle = <0, 1, 11>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 4) - Forms a triangle with Node 1. Triangle = <0, 1, 4>.
    * Pair 7: (6, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (12, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (12, 11) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (4, 11) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) - Forms a triangle with Node 4. Triangle = <1, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) - Already counted as a triangle related to Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) - Already counted as a triangle related to Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (14, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (14, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

3. Node 2:
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. Node 12:
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 2-3, 5-14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 11>, <0, 1, 4>, and <1, 4, 6>.
