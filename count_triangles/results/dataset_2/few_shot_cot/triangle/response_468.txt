Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs for Node 0 due to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 1) -> 12 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (12, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs for Node 1 due to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs for Node 2 due to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Not enough pairs for Node 3 due to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs for Node 4 due to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs for Node 5 due to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs for Node 6 due to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Not enough pairs for Node 7 due to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Not enough pairs for Node 8 due to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Not enough pairs for Node 9 due to smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
