Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> Both 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 13) -> Both 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 13) -> Both 19 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip this node as there are no pairs greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 18) -> Both 8 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 18) -> Both 12 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 18) -> Both 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 10.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 11.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 12.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 13.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 14.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 15:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 15.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 16.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 17:
    * This node is not connected to any other nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 17.

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 18.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 19.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [1].
