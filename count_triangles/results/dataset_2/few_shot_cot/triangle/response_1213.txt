Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (19, 20) -> 19 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (19, 26) -> 19 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (19, 28) -> 19 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (20, 26) -> 20 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (20, 28) -> 20 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (26, 28) -> 26 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 13) -> 2 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (2, 21) -> 2 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (4, 21) -> 4 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (13, 21) -> 13 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
  * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 3. No triangles possible.

* Node 4:
  * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 4. No triangles possible.

* Node 5:
  * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 5. No triangles possible.

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (9, 22) -> 9 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 7. No triangles possible.

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, we count the total number of triangles:

* Summarizing the triangles:
  * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 2 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 2 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are <19, 26, 0>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 25>, <2, 4, 21>, <2, 13, 21>, <15, 25, 26>, <17, 19, 25>, <0, 19, 26>, <0, 19, 17>, and <2, 4, 21>. 

Thus, the final answer is [10].
