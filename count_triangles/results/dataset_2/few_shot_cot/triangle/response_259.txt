Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 29) -> 1 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 29) -> 8 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 10) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (13, 17) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (5, 11) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 10 to 29:
    * Skip because there aren't enough nodes greater than 10 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
