Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4)

Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 4: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 5: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<0, 1, 4>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 2: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 4, 7>)

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<4, 7, 5>)

* Nodes 5, 6, 7:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs greater than these nodes where triangles can be formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<8, 4, 5>)

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
