Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the provided graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are connected as (8, 16) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are connected as (7, 2) and (12, 2) are in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are connected as (17, 18) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are connected as (13, 15) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.

- Node 19:
    - No valid pairs to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
