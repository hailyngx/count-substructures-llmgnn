Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by evaluating each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (19, 21) -> Node 19 and Node 21 are connected to Node 0 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Node 2 is connected to both Node 4 and Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> Node 3 is connected to both Node 15 and Node 17, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Both Node 3 and Node 6 are connected, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 29) -> Node 3 and Node 29 are connected, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 26) -> Node 4 is connected to Node 26, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> Node 4 is connected to Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with these nodes, as all other nodes connected to them have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles involving these nodes: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (7, 21) -> Both Node 7 and Node 21 are connected to Node 10 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Node 11 is connected to Node 17, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 27) -> Node 11 and Node 27 are connected, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) -> Node 11 is connected to Node 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 12 to 16:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as all other connected nodes have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles involving these nodes: 0

* Node 17:
    * Pair 1: (17, 20) -> Node 17 and Node 20 are connected and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 18 to 21:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as all other connected nodes have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles involving these nodes: 0

* Node 22:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 22 as all other connected nodes have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 23:
    * No direct connections to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 24 and 25:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as all other connected nodes have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles involving these nodes: 0

* Nodes 26 to 29:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as all other connected nodes have smaller node numbers.
    * Total triangles involving these nodes: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Nodes 12 to 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Nodes 18 to 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Nodes 24 and 25) + 0 (Nodes 26 to 29) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<3, 15, 17>
<11, 17, 20>
<11, 17, 20>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [3].
