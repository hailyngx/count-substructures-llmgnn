Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * There are no triangles involving Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * There are no other valid triangles involving Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * There are no triangles involving Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * There are no triangles involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * There are no triangles involving Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * There are no triangles involving Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
