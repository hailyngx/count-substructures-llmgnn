Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. They are indirectly connected via Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 29) -> 1 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. They are indirectly connected via Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs containing Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No other pairs to consider. No more triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs containing Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 29) -> 4 and 29 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider. No more triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (0, 26) -> 0 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to consider. No more triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, we can find the total number of triangles in the graph.

[<0, 1, 0>, <2, 4, 29>, <5, 0,26>]
