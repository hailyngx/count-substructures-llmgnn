Response:
Following the steps from the provided example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 23) -> 2 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 10) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 4: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (23, 17) -> 23 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (23, 10) -> 23 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (23, 10) in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (23, 0) -> 23 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 23) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 8: (17, 10) -> 17 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (17, 10) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 9: (17, 0) -> 17 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 16) -> Both 0 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (0, 24) -> Both 0 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (0, 24) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (0, 9) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 4: (16, 24) -> 16 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (16, 9) -> 16 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (24, 9) -> 24 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Following the same method for the rest of the nodes, we should examine Nodes 3 to 29 to find all the triangles. By counting the total number of triangles each node participates in and summing them up, we can find the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's proceed with the calculations.
