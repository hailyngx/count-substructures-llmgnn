Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - 3 is connected to 0 and 8, forming a triangle. Triangle <0, 3, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) - 2 is connected to 1 and 6, but 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) - 2 is connected to 6 and 1, forming a triangle. Triangle <1, 2, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 is connected to 3 and 7, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 is connected to 9 and 7, forming a triangle. Triangle <4, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - 9 is connected to 7 and 4, forming a triangle. Triangle <4, 7, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - 1 is connected to 7 and 6, but 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) - 0 is connected to 8 and 3, but 0 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) - 2 is connected to 9 and 6, forming a triangle. Triangle <2, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
