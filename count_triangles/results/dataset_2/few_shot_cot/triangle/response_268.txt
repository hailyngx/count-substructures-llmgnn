Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node and its 1-hop neighbor connections:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also directly connected as (1, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 3 are also directly connected as (0, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 3 are also directly connected as (0, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
