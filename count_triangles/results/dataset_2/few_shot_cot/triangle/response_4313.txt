Node 2 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example above, we can count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (5, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (0, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (0, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (0, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (0, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (3, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (3, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (2, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (2, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (7, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (7, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes from 5 to 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 5 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph. [11]
