Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
