Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 3

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 as the third node: <0, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the third node: <0, 3, 7>
    * No more possible triangles with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 as the third node: <1, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the third node: <1, 4, 6>
    * No more possible triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 as the third node: <2, 3, 5>
    * No more possible triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the third node: <1, 5, 6>
    * No more possible triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the third node: <7, 3, 5>
    * No more possible triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
