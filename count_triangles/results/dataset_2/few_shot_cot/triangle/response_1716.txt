Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 3) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [5].
