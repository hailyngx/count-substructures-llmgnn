Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1

Response:
Following the instructions from the example, we will perform the triangle counting for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2. 
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 7:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
