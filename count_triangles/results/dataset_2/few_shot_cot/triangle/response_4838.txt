Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (26, 25) -> 26 and 25 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (15, 16) -> 15 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skip 25 other pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (17, 20) -> 17 and 20 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (26, 24) -> 26 and 24 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (26, 18) -> 26 and 18 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 4) -> 26 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skip 46 other pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (19, 29) -> 19 and 29 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5 to 29:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5 to 29) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

The final answer is [1].
