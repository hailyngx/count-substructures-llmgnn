Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected, but they do not have a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are connected, and they share node 0 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 7) -> 15 and 7 are connected, but they do not have a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are connected, and they share node 1 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <1, 7, 17>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are connected, but they do not have a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Node 9, 15, and Node 10 are smaller neighbors, so no more triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the starting node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected, and they share node 3 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>.
    * Node 7, 11, 12, and Node 13 are smaller neighbors, so no more triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the starting node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are connected, but they do not have a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are connected, but they do not have a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are connected, but they do not have a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Node 0 and Node 16 are smaller neighbors, so no more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the starting node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Node 14, 15, and Node 19 are larger neighbors without forming any triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Node 14 and Node 16 are larger neighbors without forming any triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 17) -> 1 and 17 are connected, and they share node 7 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <1, 7, 17>.
    * Node 2, 3, 5, and Node 11 are smaller neighbors, so no more triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the starting node.

* Node 8:
    * Node 2, 11, and Node 12 are smaller neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the starting node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Node 13, 14, and Node 15 are larger neighbors without forming any triangles.

* Node 10:
    * Node 0, 4, and Node 16 are smaller neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the starting node.

* Node 11:
    * Node 0, 8, Node 7, and Node 12 are smaller neighbors without forming any triangles.

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Node 0 and Node 17 are larger neighbors without forming any triangles.

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Node 4, 18, and Node 11 are larger neighbors without forming any triangles.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed as all neighbors are either smaller or not connected.

* Node 15:
    * No triangles can be formed as all neighbors are either smaller or not connected.

* Node 16:
    * No triangles can be formed as all neighbors are smaller nodes.

* Node 17:
    * Node 1 and Node 7 are smaller neighbors without forming any triangles.

* Node 18:
    * No triangles can be formed as both neighbors are smaller nodes.

* Node 19:
    * No triangles can be formed as all neighbors are smaller nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
