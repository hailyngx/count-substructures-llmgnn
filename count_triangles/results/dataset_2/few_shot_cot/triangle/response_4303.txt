Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and 2 and 6 are connected as (2, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> Node 1 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0, but there is no edge directly connecting Node 0 and Node 1. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> Both 13 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (13, 15) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> Both 3 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (3, 19) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 2, 6>, <7, 13, 15>, <3, 9, 19>]
