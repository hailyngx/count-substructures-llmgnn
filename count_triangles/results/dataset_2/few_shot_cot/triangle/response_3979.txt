Response:
Following the provided adjacency list and edge list, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 9) -> 10 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (26, 24) -> 26 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (26, 24) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (18, 12) -> 18 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (18, 3) -> 18 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (18, 7) -> 18 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (18, 3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (13, 7) -> 13 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No connections, no triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (27, 25) -> 27 and 25 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10 to 29:
    * Skipped since they don't have at least 2 larger numbered nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
