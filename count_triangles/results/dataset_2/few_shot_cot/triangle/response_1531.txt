Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, I will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 0 are also connected as (1, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are directly connected as (2, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 is directly connected to 6. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
