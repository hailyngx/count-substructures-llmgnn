Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected. No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are directly connected. No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are directly connected. No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are directly connected. No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected. No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected. No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected. No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No additional pairs to consider. No more triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6:**
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are directly connected. No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are directly connected. No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:** 
    - Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are directly connected. No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - There are no pairs to consider with greater numbered nodes to form a triangle with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
