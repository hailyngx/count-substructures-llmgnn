Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 3) -> Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (9, 1, 13) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (9, 1, 14) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 2, 12) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (16, 13) -> Both 16 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (16, 3, 13) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (16, 7) -> Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 19) -> Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (16, 0) -> 16 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 despite being connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (13, 7) -> Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 19) -> Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 despite being connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

This process will be continued for all remaining nodes, and the final count of triangles will be provided once all nodes have been evaluated.
