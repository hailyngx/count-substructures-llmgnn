Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the given adjacency list and edge list, we will find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Triangle formed with Node 18
    * Pair 2: (8, 18) -> Triangle formed with Node 12
    * Pair 3: (8, 23) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (12, 18) -> Triangle formed with Node 8
    * Pair 5: (12, 23) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (18, 23) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (17, 20) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (17, 25) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (20, 25) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continuing this process for all nodes, we get:
    * Node 4: 0 triangles
    * Node 5: 0 triangles
    * Node 6: 0 triangles
    * Node 7: 0 triangles
    * Node 8: 2 triangles
    * Node 9: 0 triangles
    * Node 10: 0 triangles
    * Node 11: 0 triangles
    * Node 12: 0 triangles
    * Node 13: 0 triangles
    * Node 14: 0 triangles
    * Node 15: 0 triangles
    * Node 16: 0 triangles
    * Node 17: 0 triangles
    * Node 18: 0 triangles
    * Node 19: 0 triangles
    * Node 20: 0 triangles
    * Node 21: 0 triangles
    * Node 22: 0 triangles
    * Node 23: 0 triangles
    * Node 24: 0 triangles
    * Node 25: 0 triangles
    * Node 26: 0 triangles
    * Node 27: 0 triangles
    * Node 28: 0 triangles
    * Node 29: 0 triangles

The total number of triangles in the given graph is the sum of triangles found for each node: 
2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
