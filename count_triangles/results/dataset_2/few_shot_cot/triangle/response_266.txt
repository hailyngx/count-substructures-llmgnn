Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example for counting triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles possible with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles possible with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles possible with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles possible with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangles possible with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No triangles possible with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No triangles possible with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
