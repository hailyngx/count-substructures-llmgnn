Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle formed starting from Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle formed starting from Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangle formed starting from Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) +  0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
