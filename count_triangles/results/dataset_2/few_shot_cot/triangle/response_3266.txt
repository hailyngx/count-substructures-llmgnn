Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example given:
    
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6 to 14:
    * All these nodes do not have enough nodes greater than them to form triangles, so they are skipped.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the output is [4].
