Response:
Following the step-by-step approach demonstrated in the example with each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
