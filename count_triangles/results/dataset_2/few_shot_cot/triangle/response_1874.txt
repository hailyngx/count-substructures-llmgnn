Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 2) -> 10 and 2 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (18, 9) -> 18 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 16) -> 18 and 16 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (18, 17) -> 18 and 17 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 3) -> 11 and 3 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 10.
    * Pair 3: (14, 3) -> 14 and 3 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 0) -> 10 and 0 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (19, 0) -> 19 and 0 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (19, 18) -> 19 and 18 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (19, 12) -> 19 and 12 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (0, 18) -> 0 and 18 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (18, 12) -> 18 and 12 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

For the rest of the nodes, there won't be any triangles formed as the remaining nodes cannot form a triangle with two other nodes greater than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
