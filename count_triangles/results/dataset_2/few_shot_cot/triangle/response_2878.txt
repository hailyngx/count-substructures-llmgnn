    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (27, 2) -> 27 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 27 and 2 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (27, 4) -> 27 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 2 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (18, 25) -> 18 and 25 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (6, 25) -> 6 and 25 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* All other nodes do not have enough connections to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
