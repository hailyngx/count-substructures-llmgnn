Response:
This task involves counting the number of triangles in the graph based on the provided information. I will break it down step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> 16 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    No possible triangles as there is only one node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    No possible triangles as there is only one node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.

* Node 10:
    No possible triangles as there are not enough nodes.

* Node 11:
    No possible triangles as there are not enough nodes.

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (6, 19) -> 6 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.

* Node 14:
    No possible triangles as there are not enough nodes.

* Node 15:
    No more possible triangles as all combinations involving node 15 have been covered.

* Node 16:
    No more possible triangles as all combinations involving node 16 have been covered.

* Node 17:
    No more possible triangles as all combinations involving node 17 have been covered.

* Node 18:
    No more possible triangles as all combinations involving node 18 have been covered.

* Node 19:
    No more possible triangles as all combinations involving node 19 have been covered.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
