Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>.
    - Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 11>.
    - Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are indirectly connected through node 16. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 7>.
    - Other pairs involve nodes smaller than Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 13, 2>.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 16, 4>.
    - No other triangles can be formed.

6. Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <5, 6, 11>.
    - Other pairs involve nodes smaller than Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Node 6:
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <5, 14, 7>.
    - Other pairs involve nodes smaller than Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (0, 16) -> 0 and 16 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 16, 8>.
    - No other triangles can be formed.

10. Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. Node 10:
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. Node 12:
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

14. Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (1, 15) -> 1 and 15 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 15, 13>.
    - Other pairs involve nodes smaller than Node 13.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 1

15. Node 14:
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

16. Node 15:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.

17. Node 16:
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.

18. Node 17:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.

19. Node 18:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.

20. Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
