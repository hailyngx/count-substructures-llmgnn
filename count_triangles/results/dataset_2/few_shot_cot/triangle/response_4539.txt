Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6, 7, 8, and 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 6.

        Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
