Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (14, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than Node 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than Node 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than Node 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs with greater nodes available to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than Node 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than Node 10.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * No pairs with greater nodes available to form triangles.

* Node 12:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 13:
    * No pairs with greater nodes available to form triangles.

* Node 14:
    * No pairs with greater nodes available to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
