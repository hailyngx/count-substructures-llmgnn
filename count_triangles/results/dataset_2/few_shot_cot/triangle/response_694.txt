Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Connected to both 4 and 5. Forming a triangle <0, 4, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 14) -> Connected to both 4 and 14. Forming a triangle <1, 4, 14>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Connected to both 4 and 10. Forming a triangle <1, 4, 10>.
    * Skip all other pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> Connected to both 5 and 11. Forming a triangle <2, 5, 11>.
