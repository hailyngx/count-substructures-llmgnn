Response:
Following the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the graph with 20 nodes. Let's go through each node step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 15.
    * Pair 2: (16, 12) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip, no triangles can be formed with just one connection.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> Direct neighbors, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (11, 5) -> Direct neighbors, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (14, 13) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (13, 10) -> Direct neighbors, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip, no triangles can be formed with just one connection.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (18, 2) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (18, 11) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (18, 14) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (9, 16) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip, not enough connections to form a triangle.

* Node 10:
    * Skip, not enough connections to form a triangle.

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 12:
    * Skip, not enough connections to form a triangle. 

* Node 13:
    * Skip, not enough connections to form a triangle.

* Node 14:
    * Skip, not enough connections to form a triangle.

* Node 15:
    * Pair 1: (19, 13) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 16:
    * Pair 1: (0, 10) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 17:
    * Skip, not enough connections to form a triangle.

* Node 18:
    * Pair 1: (19, 7) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (0, 15) -> Direct neighbors, triangle formed with Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 18) + 1 (Node 19) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
