Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Connected through edge (9, 0) and (0, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> Connected through edge (9, 0) and (0, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> Connected through edge (9, 0) and (0, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) -> Connected through edge (9, 0) and (0, 1). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Connected through edge (5, 1) and (1, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Connected through edge (5, 1) and (1, 0). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Connected through edge (5, 7) and (7, 1). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> Connected through edge (8, 3) and (3, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> Connected through edge (8, 2) and (2, 4). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> Connected through edge (8, 0) and (0, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) -> Connected through edge (8, 7) and (7, 6). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> Connected through edge (9, 5) and (5, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> Connected through edge (9, 3) and (3, 6). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 2) -> Connected through edge (9, 0) and (0, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip as there are no triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are no triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Connected through edge (1, 7) and (7, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Connected through edge (1, 6) and (6, 3). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Connected through edge (1, 7) and (7, 8). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> Connected through edge (5, 1) and (1, 0). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> Connected through edge (5, 1) and (1, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Connected through edge (5, 7) and (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> Connected through edge (6, 1) and (1, 0). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> Connected through edge (6, 3) and (3, 2). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Connected through edge (6, 7) and (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Connected through edge (5, 3) and (3, 9). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Connected through edge (5, 9) and (9, 0). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are [14] triangles in the given graph.
