Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 10) -> 2 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 10) -> 0 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> Both 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: No possible pairs with nodes greater than 9 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (0, 14) -> 0 and 14 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Pair 1: No possible pairs with nodes greater than 13 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: No possible pairs with nodes greater than 14 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
