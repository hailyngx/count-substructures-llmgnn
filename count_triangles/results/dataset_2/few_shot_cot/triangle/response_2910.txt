Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 3) - Node 7 is not connected to 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - Triangle formed: <4, 1, 7>
    * Pair 4: (8, 2) - Triangle formed: <1, 8, 2>
    * Pair 5: (8, 7) - Node 7 is not connected to 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) - Triangle formed: <2, 8, 1>
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Triangle formed: <3, 6, 8>
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) - Triangle formed: <3, 6, 0>
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [6].
