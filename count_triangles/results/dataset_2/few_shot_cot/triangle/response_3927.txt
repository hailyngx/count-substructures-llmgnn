Response:
Following the step-by-step process of counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> No triangle formed as 11 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (18, 19) -> No triangle formed as 18 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 18) -> 10 and 18 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 3) -> No triangle formed as 10 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 15) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 15 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (15, 10) -> No triangle formed as 15 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (16, 17) -> No triangle formed as 16 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10:
    * Similar to above, there are no triangles formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 11 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip as there are fewer than two nodes greater than Node 13.

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 2 or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 15 to 19:
    * Following the same steps, no triangles are formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
