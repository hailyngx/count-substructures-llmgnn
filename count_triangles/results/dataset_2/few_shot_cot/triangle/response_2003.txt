Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided for the given 30-node graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (19, 20) -> 19 and 20 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 15) -> 19 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 29) -> 19 and 29 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (19, 23) -> 19 and 23 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 24) -> 13 and 24 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs (17, 27), (17, 24), (27, 24) are potential triangles, but none of them form a triangle as the nodes are not directly connected in the given edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Similar comparisons are made for each node with higher numbered nodes. No triangles formed.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of Node 10. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 20) -> 10 and 20 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of Node 10. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16:
    * Similar comparisons are made for each node with higher numbered nodes. No triangles formed.

* Node 17:
    * Pairs (17, 24) and (17, 2) are potential triangles but do not form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 18, 19, 20:
    * Similar comparisons are made for each node with higher numbered nodes. No triangles formed.

* Nodes 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Similar comparisons are made for each node with higher numbered nodes. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4-9) + 2 (Node 10) + 0 (Nodes 11-16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Nodes 19-29) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
