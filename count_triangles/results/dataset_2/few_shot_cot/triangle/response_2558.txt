Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 19) -> Triangle formed with node 18. Triangle <15, 19, 18>.
    * Pair 2: (15, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 29) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 26) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (22, 13) -> Triangle formed with node 12. Triangle <22, 13, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (22, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 25) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (15, 20) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (22, 28) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> Triangle formed with node 12. Triangle <13, 16, 12>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (25, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 29:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
