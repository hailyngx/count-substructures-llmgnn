This process will continue for Nodes 12 to 29, identifying triangles involving each node as the smallest numbered node. Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.

**Total number of triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 11) = 12**.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
