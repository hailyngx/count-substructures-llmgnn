Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected as (2, 6) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected as (2, 7) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are connected as (2, 4) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 2, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 2, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 2, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 3, but they are not connected in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 4, and they are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
