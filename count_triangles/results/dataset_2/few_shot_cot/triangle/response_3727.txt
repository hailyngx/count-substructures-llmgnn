Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, 12, 10, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 12, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 10
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 11, 0, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 11, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 2

Response:
Following the same steps as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed. Nodes 1 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed. Nodes 1 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed. Nodes 1 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed. Nodes 1 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed. Nodes 2 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed. Nodes 2 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 9: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed. Nodes 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13:
    * No triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0)
* Final Answer: [3]

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
