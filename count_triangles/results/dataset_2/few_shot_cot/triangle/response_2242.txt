Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) - Connected through Node 9, and Node 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 11) - Connected through Node 9, and Node 11 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) - Connected through Node 4, and Node 2 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 1. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) - Connected through Node 13, and Node 17 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 2. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (19, 18) - Connected through Node 19, and Node 18 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 3. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) - Connected through Node 12, and Node 15 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 4. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) - Connected through Node 9, and Node 11 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 6. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 7 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 8 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) - Connected through Node 6, and Node 11 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 9. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
