Response:
Following the step-by-step method described in the example with the provided graph, we can count the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 5) -> 10 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and they are connected, but not forming a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and they are connected, but not forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and they are connected, but not forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5, no triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
  * All skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [0].
