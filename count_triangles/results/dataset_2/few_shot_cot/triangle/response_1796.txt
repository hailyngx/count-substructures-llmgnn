Response:
Following the same approach as the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
    - <5, 7, 0>
    - <5, 13, 0>
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - <0, 1, 7>
    - <1, 6, 14>
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
    - <5, 2, 11>
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - <5, 3, 10>
    - <5, 3, 13>
    - <3, 10, 12>
    - <13, 3, 0>
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

5. Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. Node 5:
    - <0, 5, 13>
    - <0, 5, 3>
    - <5, 8, 7>
    - <5, 8, 13>
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 4

7. Node 6:
    - <1, 14, 6>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
    - <0, 7, 1>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8:
    - <5, 8, 13>
    - <7, 8, 11>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
    - <5, 9, 13>
    - <9, 14, 12>
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

11. Node 10:
    - <8, 10, 11>
    - <2, 10, 11>
    - <3, 10, 12>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. Node 11:
    - <1, 11, 14>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. Node 12:
    - <9, 12, 14>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

14. Node 13:
    - <0, 13, 5>
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 4 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 3 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 21.

Therefore, the answer is [21].
