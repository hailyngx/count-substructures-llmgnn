Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest node <0, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 11 are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest node <0, 4, 11>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 11 are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest node <0, 7, 11>.
    * Pair 5: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 10 are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest node <1, 6, 10>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 appeared in Pair 1. No new triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest node <2, 13, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 appeared in Node 1, so no new triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 appeared in Node 1, so no new triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest node <5, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 12 as the smallest node <12, 13, 14>.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
