Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 12) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 14) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 9) -> 10 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (10, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 9) -> 11 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 2) -> 11 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 11) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (11, 1) -> 11 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (11, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Continue this process for Nodes 3 to 14, following the same steps.

Continue this process for Nodes 4 to 14, and calculate the total number of triangles in the graph by adding the triangles found for each node.

Finally, provide the total number of unique triangles found inside brackets [].
