Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (10, 29) -> 10 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (27, 29) -> 27 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (27, 16) -> 27 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (29, 16) -> 29 and 16 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.

    - Pair 3: (4, 25) -> 4 and 25 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 22) -> 4 and 22 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 22) -> 7 and 22 are not connected. No triangle formed.
