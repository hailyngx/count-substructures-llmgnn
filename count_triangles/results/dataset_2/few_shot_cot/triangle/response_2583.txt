Response:
Following the example step-by-step calculation, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (9, 12) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 4: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 11) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (12, 13) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> 7 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (8, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (12, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

The process continues for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 2 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) = 17.

Therefore, there are [17] triangles in the given graph.
