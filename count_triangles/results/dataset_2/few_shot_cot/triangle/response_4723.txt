Response:
Following the method described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 12) -> Both 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> Both 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 6) -> Both 12 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 13) -> Both 12 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (16, 26) -> Both 16 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2: 
    * Pair 1: (5, 22) -> Both 5 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. 
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 22) -> Both 5 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. 
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5: 
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (0, 23) -> Both 0 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 12) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (0, 13) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 0.
    * Pair 5: (12, 13) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 0.
    * Pair 6: (12, 23) -> Both 12 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> Already counted when analyzing Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> Both 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. 
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12: 
    * No possible pairs to consider for forming triangles, each will have a total of 0 triangles.

* Summing up all the triangles found for each node:
  * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
