Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 6), but since 8 and 6 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) - 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 8), but since 7 and 8 are both smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 0, 3>, <2, 0, 5>, <2, 0, 6>, <4, 7, 8>]
