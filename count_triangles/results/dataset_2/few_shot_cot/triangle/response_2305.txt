Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 28) -> 14 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Checking for a common 1-hop neighbor between them:
        Node 14 is connected to 27, and Node 28 is connected to 15. Nodes 27 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 28) -> 16 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Checking for a common 1-hop neighbor between them:
        Node 16 is connected to 24, and Node 28 is connected to 15. Nodes 24 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (23, 12) -> 23 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Checking for a common 1-hop neighbor between them:
        Node 23 is connected to 15, and Node 12 is connected to 13. Nodes 15 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (23, 6) -> 23 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (15, 23) -> 15 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Checking for a common 1-hop neighbor between them:
        Node 15 is connected to 28, and Node 23 is connected to 1. Nodes 28 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangle with any pair involving Node 4.
