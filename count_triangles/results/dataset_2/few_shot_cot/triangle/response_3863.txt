Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 3: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 4: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    - Based on the adjacency lists and remaining pairs to consider, no triangles can be formed with nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Nodes 2 to 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
