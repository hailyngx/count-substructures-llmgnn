Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by following the step-by-step process for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10 since 4, 8, and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 since 4, 10, and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 16 since 1, 5, and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 2: (1, 11) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 11 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 16) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10 since 5, 16, and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) -> No triangle formed as 10 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15 since 3, 5, and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 15 since 3, 9, and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 3: (5, 15) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 since 5, 15, and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other.

Summarizing the triangles found for each node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 15.
