Response:
Following the step-by-step process illustrated in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 3) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 8, 3>.
    * Pair 7: (8, 1) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 3) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (0, 1) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 7, 8>.
    * Pair 5: (7, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 1) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 1) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 1) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 7, 1>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 8, 0>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 2>.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 1>.
    * Pair 5: (8, 5) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 8, 5>.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 8, 9>.
    * Pair 7: (8, 0) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 3) - Directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 8, 3>.
    * Pair 9: (8, 1) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles formed as there are no other nodes left to form triangles.

For Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9, there are no triangles that can be formed as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 5 (Node 4) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph. [14]
