Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 3 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 8 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
