Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected in the graph.
    * Pair 6: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * No more pairs left for Node 1 as other nodes are smaller. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes (0 and 1) are skipped.
    * No more valid pairs left for Node 2 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * No more valid pairs left for Node 4 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * No more valid pairs left for Node 5 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * No more valid pairs left for Node 6 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * No more valid pairs left for Node 7 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
