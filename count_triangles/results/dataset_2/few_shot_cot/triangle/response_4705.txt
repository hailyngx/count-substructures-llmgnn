Response:
Following the step-by-step method as demonstrated in the example provided:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are directly connected, forming a pair with Node 0.
        * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are not directly connected.
        * Pair 3: (18, 12) -> 18 and 12 are directly connected, forming a pair with Node 0.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are directly connected, forming a pair with Node 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are directly connected, forming a pair with Node 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are directly connected, forming a pair with Node 5.
        * Pair 2: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are not directly connected.
        * Pair 3: (13, 18) -> 13 and 18 are directly connected, forming a pair with Node 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are not directly connected.
        * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
        * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
        * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Nodes 10 to 19:
        * All skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 5) = 6.

    Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
