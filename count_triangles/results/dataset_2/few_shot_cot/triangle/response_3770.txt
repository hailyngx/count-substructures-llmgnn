Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for the given graph, we will calculate the number of triangles:

- Node 0:
    - (5, 9): Not a 1-hop neighbor pair. No triangle.
    - (5, 1): Not a 1-hop neighbor pair. No triangle.
    - (5, 2): Not a 1-hop neighbor pair. No triangle.
    - (5, 3): 1-hop neighbors and connected. Possible triangle with 3.
    - (9, 1): Not a 1-hop neighbor pair. No triangle.
    - (9, 2): Not a 1-hop neighbor pair. No triangle.
    - (9, 3): Not a 1-hop neighbor pair. No triangle.
    - (1, 2): 1-hop neighbors but not connected. No triangle.
    - (1, 3): 1-hop neighbors and connected. Possible triangle with 3.
    - (2, 3): Not a 1-hop neighbor pair. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - (6, 7): Not a 1-hop neighbor pair. No triangle.
    - (6, 8): 1-hop neighbors and connected. Possible triangle with 8.
    - (6, 4): Not a 1-hop neighbor pair. No triangle.
    - (7, 8): 1-hop neighbors and connected. Possible triangle with 8.
    - (7, 4): Not a 1-hop neighbor pair. No triangle.
    - (8, 4): 1-hop neighbors and connected. Possible triangle with 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 2:
    - (6, 0): 1-hop neighbors and connected. Possible triangle with 6.
    - (6, 3): Not a 1-hop neighbor pair. No triangle.
    - (0, 3): 1-hop neighbors and connected. Possible triangle with 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - (5, 7): 1-hop neighbors and connected. Possible triangle with 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - (7, 8): 1-hop neighbors and connected. Possible triangle with 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - (6, 8): 1-hop neighbors and connected. Possible triangle with 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - (5, 9): 1-hop neighbors and connected. Possible triangle with 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - (9, 1): Not a 1-hop neighbor pair. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - (5, 9): 1-hop neighbors and connected. Possible triangle with 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - (6, 7): Not a 1-hop neighbor pair. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, summing up the total triangles for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
