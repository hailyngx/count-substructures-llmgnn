Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Skipped as 1 is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Skipped as 1 is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 3: (1, 14) -> Skipped as 1 is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> Skipped as 5 is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 5: (5, 14) -> Skipped as 5 is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 6: (9, 14) -> Skipped as 9 is smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipped all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipped all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Skipped as 5 is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> Skipped as 5 is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> Skipped as 5 is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 4: (9, 12) -> Skipped as 9 is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 5: (9, 14) -> Skipped as 9 is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 6: (12, 14) -> Skipped as 12 is smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 13) -> Skipped as 9 is smaller than 5.
    * Pair 3: (2, 12) -> Skipped as 2 is smaller than 5.
    * Pair 4: (2, 14) -> Skipped as 2 is smaller than 5.
    * Pair 5: (12, 13) -> Skipped as 12 is smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6 to 14:
    * Skipped for now as they involve smaller nodes.

Now, let's summarize the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
