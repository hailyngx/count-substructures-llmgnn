Response:
Following the step-by-step process of counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (17, 24) -> 17 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected (24, 0) as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 20) -> 0 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected (0, 20) as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected (1, 14) as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected (7, 2) as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 18) -> 2 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 20) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
