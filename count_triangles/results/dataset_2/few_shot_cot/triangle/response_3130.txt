Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> Both 3 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 21) -> Both 3 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (15, 21) -> Both 15 and 21 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (18, 20) -> Both 18 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 0) -> Both 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> Both 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (3, 23) -> Both 3 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (3, 22) -> Both 3 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (10, 12) -> Both 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (12, 19) -> Both 12 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (15, 11) -> Both 15 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

The process is continued for Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Summarizing the triangles for all nodes, we get:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 2 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 20) + 1 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 1 (Node 24) + 1 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 1 (Node 27) + 1 (Node 28) + 1 (Node 29) = 24.

Therefore, there are 24 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [24].
