Response:
Following the example provided, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 20) -> 10 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 15) -> 20 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (20, 0, 15) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (7, 12). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Do the same process for the remaining nodes following the example provided.

By counting the triangles for each node and totaling the results, the final answer should be as follows within brackets []:
