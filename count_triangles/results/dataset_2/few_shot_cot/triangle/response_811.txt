Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3)

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Both 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 3) -> Both 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (9, 3) -> Both 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4: 
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9: Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
