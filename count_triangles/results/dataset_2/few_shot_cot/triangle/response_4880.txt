Response:
Let's start by counting the triangles for each node in the graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Connected to Node 1 but Node 4 is not connected to Node 1. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 12) -> Connected to Node 1 but Node 12 is not connected to Node 1. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 12) -> Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 13) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Only 1-hop neighbor is Node 4, which is greater than Node 3. No triangles possible for Node 3.

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (8, 12) -> Both 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <8, 4, 12>.
    - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Connected to Node 1 but Node 3 is not connected to Node 1. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Only 1-hop neighbors are Node 7, 14, and 13, all greater than Node 5. No triangles possible for Node 5.

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 10) -> Both 7 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <7, 6, 10>.
    - Pair 2: (7, 13) -> Both 7 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <7, 6, 13>.
    - Pair 3: (8, 4) -> Connected to Node 8 but Node 4 is not connected to Node 8. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (8, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (12, 0) -> Both 12 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (6, 14) -> Connected to Node 6 but Node 14 is not connected to Node 6. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Only 1-hop neighbors are greater than Node 9. No triangles possible for Node 9.

- Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (6, 14) -> Connected to Node 6 but Node 14 is not connected to Node 6. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 11:
    - Only 1-hop neighbors are greater than Node 11. No triangles possible for Node 11.

- Node 12:
    - Pair 1: (4, 10) -> Both 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 12, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 12, 10>.
    - Pair 2: (1, 0) -> Connected to Node 1 but Node 0 is not connected to Node 1. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 13:
    - Pair 1: (6, 5) -> Connected to Node 6 but Node 5 is not connected to Node 6. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 14:
    - The only 1-hop neighbor is Node 5, which is greater than Node 14. No triangles possible for Node 14.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
