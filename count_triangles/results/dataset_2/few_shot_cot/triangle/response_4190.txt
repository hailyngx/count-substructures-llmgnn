Response:
Following the method mentioned in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (10, 6) -> 10 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (13, 14) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (11, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 5) -> 11 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (12, 5) -> 12 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The process will continue for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to count the total number of triangles.

After counting the triangles for all nodes, the final count will be presented within brackets [].
