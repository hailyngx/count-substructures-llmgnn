Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same step-by-step process as mentioned in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> Nodes 7 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 17) -> Nodes 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected as (7, 17). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 17) -> Nodes 15 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> Nodes 3 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> Nodes 5 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected as (5, 13). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 19) -> Nodes 3 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (12, 18) -> Nodes 12 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> Nodes 10 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are directly connected as (10, 16). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 or 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Nodes 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are directly connected as (5, 14). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (14, 17) -> Nodes 14 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, and they are directly connected as (14, 17). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<7, 14, 17>
<5, 14, 17>
<1, 3, 5>
<4, 10, 16>
<0, 7, 17>
<3, 5, 13>
