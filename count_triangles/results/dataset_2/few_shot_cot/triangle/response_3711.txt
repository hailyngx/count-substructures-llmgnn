Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 19) -> 2 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 17 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 15) -> 13 and 15 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (17, 15) -> 17 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 0) -> 17 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 15) -> 5 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (15, 18) -> 15 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no other nodes greater than 4 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

This process continues for the remaining nodes until all possible triangles are counted. Let's continue with Node 5 and beyond.
