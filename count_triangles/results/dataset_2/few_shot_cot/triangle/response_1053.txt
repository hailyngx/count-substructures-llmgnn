Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are not connected.
    - Pair 2: (3, 17) -> 3 and 17 are not connected.
    - Pair 3: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are not connected.
    - Pair 4: (12, 17) -> 12 and 17 are not connected.
    - Pair 5: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are not connected.
    - Pair 6: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - The only pair we could consider is (11, 17), but since 11 and 17 are both smaller than 1, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (15, 3) -> 15 and 3 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (15, 6) -> 15 and 6 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (15, 9) -> 15 and 9 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 5: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 6: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are directly connected as (6, 12) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (15, 17) -> 15 and 17 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (15, 19) -> 15 and 19 are directly connected as (15, 19) shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are directly connected as (7, 13) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (12, 10) -> 12 and 10 are directly connected as (12, 10) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - The only pair we could consider is (2, 13), but since 2 and 13 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, and 13:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

* Node 14:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 14.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    - Pair 1: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 14) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
