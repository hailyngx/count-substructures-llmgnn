Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are not connected in 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 1) -> 14 and 1 are not connected in 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> Both 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 14) -> Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 14) -> Both 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 14 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 3 through 14:
    * Skipping these nodes as they are smaller than Node 2 or do not have enough larger numbered nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3-14) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are <5, 9, 14>, <5, 2, 9>, and <5, 2, 14>.

Thus, the final answer is [3].
