Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected through node 0 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes 1 as it is smaller than 3. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. The remaining pairs involve nodes 5, 7, and 9 which are larger.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. The remaining pairs involve nodes 6, 8, and 4 which are larger.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. The remaining pairs involve nodes 7 and 9 which are larger.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. The remaining pair involves node 9 which is larger.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9)
* Total number of triangles in the graph = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
