Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 16 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (16, 13) -> 16 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Similar to Node 0, find triangles for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Similar to Nodes 0 and 1, find triangles for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Similar to Nodes 0, 1, and 2, find triangles for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Similar to previous nodes, find triangles for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Similar to previous nodes, find triangles for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Similar to previous nodes, find triangles for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Similar to previous nodes, find triangles for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Similar to previous nodes, find triangles for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Similar to previous nodes, find triangles for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 10 to 19:
    * Skipping analysis for Nodes 10 to 19 as they do not have at least two larger neighbors to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the output is [13].
