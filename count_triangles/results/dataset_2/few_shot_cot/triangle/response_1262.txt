Response:
Following the step-by-step process like in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> Nodes 10 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 22) -> Nodes 10 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 22) -> Nodes 14 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as no other nodes are greater than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1. They are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (13, 18) -> Nodes 13 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 2) -> Nodes 13 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (18, 14) -> Nodes 18 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Nodes 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 16) -> Nodes 1 and 16 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 16) -> Nodes 3 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skip these nodes as there are no pairs to form triangles greater than these nodes.

* Node 10:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 that are smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 that are smaller than 11.
    * Pair 1: (11, 27) -> Nodes 11 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 11, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> Nodes 11 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 11, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 12, 13:
    * Not considering for triangles as there are no pairs with nodes greater than them.

* Node 14:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 10. They are smaller than Node 14.
    * Pair 1: (18, 22) -> Nodes 18 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 14, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 15, 16, 17:
    * Not considering for triangles as there are no pairs with nodes greater than them.

* Node 18:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, 14. They are smaller than Node 18.
    * Pair 1: (13, 28) -> Nodes 13 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 18, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 19, 20, 21, 22:
    * Not considering for triangles as there are no pairs with nodes greater than them.

* Node 23:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 23.
    * Pair 1: (24, 25) -> Nodes 24 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 23, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 24, 25:
    * Not considering for triangles as there are no pairs with nodes greater than them.

* Nodes 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Not considering for triangles as there are no pairs with nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 (Node 11) + 0 + 1 (Node 18) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 23) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
