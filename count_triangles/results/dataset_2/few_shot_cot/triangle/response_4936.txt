Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list. Node 7 is connected to node 0. So, a triangle is formed <0, 3, 7>.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list. Node 3 is connected to node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list. Node 3 is connected to node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list. Node 5 is connected to node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list. Node 7 is connected to node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are connected as (1, 2) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed <1, 2, 7>.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list. Node 2 is connected to node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected as (2, 5) shown in the edge list. Node 2 is connected to node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list. Node 2 is connected to node 1. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list. No other node is present in the list to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Already counted in Node 1. No additional triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are connected as (0, 4) shown in the edge list. Node 0 is connected to node 3. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes, as they have been already counted. No new triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes, as they have been already counted. No new triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Already counted in Node 1. No additional triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list. No other node is present in the list to form a triangle.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Already counted in Node 1. No additional triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> Already counted in Node 0. No additional triangle formed.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 3, 7>, <1, 2, 7>]
