Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
            * No other pairs involving Node 2 for triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * No other pairs involving Node 3 for triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * No other pairs involving Node 4 for triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * No other pairs involving Node 6 for triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * No other pairs involving Node 7 for triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

        Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
