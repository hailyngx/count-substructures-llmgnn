Response:
Following the method from the example, we will identify the triangles formed by each node. At the end, we will sum up the total number of unique triangles found in the graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (12, 15) -> Connected to both nodes directly.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 28) -> Connected to both nodes directly.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider since Node 0 and Node 1 are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 21) -> Both nodes are connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (5, 26) -> Both nodes are connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (5, 3) -> Both nodes are connected directly.
    * Pair 4: (21, 6) -> Both nodes are connected directly.
    * Pair 5: (21, 4) -> Both nodes are connected directly.
    * Pair 6: (21, 5) -> Both nodes are connected directly.
