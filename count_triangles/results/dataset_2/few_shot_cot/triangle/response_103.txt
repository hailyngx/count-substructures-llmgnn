Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Nodes 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Nodes 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Nodes 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (9, 7) -> Nodes 9 and 7 are connected. No other shared neighbor with them. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are connected. Shared neighbor 2 connected with them. Triangle formed: <5, 7, 2>.
            * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Nodes 4 and 5 are connected. No shared neighbor with them. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are connected. No shared neighbor with them. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> Nodes 4 and 3 are connected. No shared neighbor with them. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are connected. No shared neighbor with them. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Nodes 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Nodes 3 and 4 are connected. No shared neighbor with them. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

        Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

        The unique triangle found is <5, 7, 2>.

        The final answer is [1].
