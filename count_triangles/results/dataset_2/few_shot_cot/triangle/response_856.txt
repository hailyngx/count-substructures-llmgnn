Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (21, 26) -> 21 and 26 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 13) -> 21 and 13 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 13) -> 26 and 13 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (21, 15) -> Forms a triangle with node 15.
    * Pair 2: (21, 24) -> 21 and 24 are not connected, so no triangle formed.

Calculating the total number of triangles by adding up the triangles found for each node:
\[3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 5 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 2 (Node 15) + 3 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 3 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 2 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 33\]

Therefore, there are 33 triangles in the given graph.
