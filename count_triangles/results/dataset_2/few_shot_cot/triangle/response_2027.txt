Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 10) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 10 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed as 10 and 12 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 11 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (11, 6) -> No triangle formed as 11 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 13 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 12) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (0, 14) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 14 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 13 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 11 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed as 11 and 13 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:

    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
