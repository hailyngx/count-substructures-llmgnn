Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 14) <0, 4, 14> -> One triangle formed as 4, 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected.

11. Node 10:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 10. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

20. Node 19:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 19. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 16) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
