Response:
Following the instructions from the example, here are the steps to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 19) -> Node 17 is not directly connected to Node 19. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 17) -> Node 11 is not directly connected to Node 17. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 17) -> Node 3 is not directly connected to Node 17. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (17, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (17, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (14, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (15, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * No triangle can be formed starting from Node 10.

* Node 11 to Node 19:
    * None of these nodes has at least two nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
