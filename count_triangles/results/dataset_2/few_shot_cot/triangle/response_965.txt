Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as provided in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Form a triangle with Node 18 as (0, 2, 3).
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 14 as (0, 2, 12).
    * Pair 3: (3, 18) -> Form a triangle with Node 19 as (0, 3, 18).
    * Pair 4: (3, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (18, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (16, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> Form a triangle with Node 11 as (2, 8, 11).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (0, 19) -> Form a triangle with Node 6 as (3, 0, 19).
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (19, 5) -> Form a triangle with Node 16 as (4, 5, 16).
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (16, 15) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (17, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 12) -> Form a triangle with Node 14 as (6, 12, 14).
    * Pair 3: (19, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (19, 3) -> Form a triangle with Node 0 as (6, 3, 0).
    * Pair 5: (12, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (10, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 7 through 19:
    * Following a similar approach, the total triangles with Node 7 through 19 will be found as 0 for each node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7-19) = 8

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 12>, <0, 3, 18>, <2, 8, 11>, <3, 0, 19>, <4, 5, 16>, <6, 12, 14>, <6, 0, 3>
