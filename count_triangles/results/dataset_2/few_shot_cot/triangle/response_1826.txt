Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (13, 24) -> 13 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 13 and 24 are also connected. 
        * Pair 2: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
        * Pair 3: (24, 10) -> Same as above.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (13, 26) -> 13 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 13 and 26 are also connected.
        * No other possible triangle involving Node 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (26, 6) -> 26 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected.
        * No other possible triangle involving Node 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * No possible triangles with Node 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (8, 28) -> 8 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
        * No other possible triangle involving Node 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected.
        * No other possible triangle involving Node 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (8, 28) -> 8 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected.
