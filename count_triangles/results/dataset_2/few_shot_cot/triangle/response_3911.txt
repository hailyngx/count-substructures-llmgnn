Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 4: (1, 12) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 6: (2, 13) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Pair 7: (2, 12) -> Connected, triangle formed: <0, 2, 12>.
    * Pair 8: (3, 13) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<0, 2, 12>).

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<0, 2, 12>).

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 11:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 12:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 14:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

Adding up the total triangles for each node: 1 (<0, 2, 12>)

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
