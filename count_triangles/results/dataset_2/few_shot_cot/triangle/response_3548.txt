Response:
Following the process described in the first example, here is the detailed breakdown for counting the triangles.

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (12, 19) -> 12 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (16, 19) -> 16 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (12, 6) -> 12 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 12 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - Pair 1: (8, 15) -> 8 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - The only pair we could consider is (11, 5), but since 11 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Nodes 8, 9, 10:
    - Skipped as there are no valid pairs to form triangles with them.

10. Node 11:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. Node 12:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. Node 13:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. Node 14:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. Node 15:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. Node 16:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

16. Node 17:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

17. Node 18:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

18. Node 19:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
