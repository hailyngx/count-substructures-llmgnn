Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 12) -> 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (12, 11) -> 12 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (12, 3) -> 12 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (11, 3) -> 11 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 1:
    * Similar to Node 0, we will evaluate all possible pairs with Node 1. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0 and 1, we find the following triangle:
        * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 3 to 14 to count the number of triangles formed involving each node.

After calculating the triangles for each node, sum them up to find the total number of triangles in the graph.

Finally, provide the answer within brackets [].
