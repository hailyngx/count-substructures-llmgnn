Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 and Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 and Node 9.
    - Pair 2: (6, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 and Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 3.
    - Pair 2: (4, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 and Node 6.
    - Pair 2: (9, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 6.
    - Pair 3: (7, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 and Node 6.
    - Pair 4: (8, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 and Node 6.
    - Pair 5: (6, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 and Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 5

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 7.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 7.
    - Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 and Node 7.
    - Pair 4: (7, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 7 and Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 4

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 and Node 9.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 9.
    - Pair 3: (9, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 2.
    - Pair 4: (9, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 3.
    - Pair 5: (9, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 1.
    - Pair 6: (9, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 9 and Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 6

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 5 + 4 + 0 + 6 = 22

Therefore, there are [22] triangles in the given graph.
