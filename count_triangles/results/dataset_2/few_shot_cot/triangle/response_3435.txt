Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 18) -> 9 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 26) -> 9 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 26) -> 18 and 26 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 22) -> 7 and 22 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected, so potential triangle (2, 7, 22).
    * Pair 2: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 25) -> 7 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 25) -> 4 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are directly connected, so potential triangle (2, 13, 16).
    * Pair 9: (13, 25) -> 13 and 25 are directly connected, so potential triangle (2, 13, 25).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<2, 13, 16>, <2, 13, 25>)

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already processed.
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already processed.
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes already processed.
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10 to 29:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
