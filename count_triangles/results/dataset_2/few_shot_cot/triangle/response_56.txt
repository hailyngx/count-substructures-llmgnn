Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    - No viable triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 1:
    - No viable triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 1 are directly connected as (9, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 6 are directly connected as (9, 6) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - No viable triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 5:
    - No viable triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 6:
    - No viable triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 7:
    - No viable triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 8:
    - No viable triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 9:
    - No viable triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
