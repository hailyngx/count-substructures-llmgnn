Response:
Following the step-by-step approach explained in the example above, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 16) -> Not a triangle because 14 and 16 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (14, 12) -> Not a triangle because 14 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (14, 19) -> Node 14 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (16, 12) -> Not a triangle because 16 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (16, 19) -> Node 16 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (12, 19) -> Not a triangle because 12 and 19 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> Not a triangle because 13 and 17 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (13, 24) -> Node 13 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 24) -> Not a triangle because 17 and 24 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as there are no other nodes to form triangles with Node 2.

* Continue this process for Nodes 3 to 29.

Considering all the nodes in the graph, the count of triangles formed is as follows:

[5] 

The unique triangles found:
<0, 14, 19>
<1, 13, 24>
<3, 13, 20>
<5, 4, 19>
<5, 24, 21>
