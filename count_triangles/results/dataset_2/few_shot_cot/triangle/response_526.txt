Response:
Following the method outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes connected to Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 8) -> 12 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pairs including Node 0, 1, and 7 are skipped as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3: 
    * Pairs including Node 0, 1, and 2 are skipped as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pairs including Node 0, 1, 2, and 3 are skipped as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (11, 12) -> 11 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pairs including Node 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are skipped as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pairs including Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are skipped as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pairs including Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are skipped as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> 9 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Thus, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5] and the unique triangles found are <9, 1, 12>, <9, 14, 7>, <5, 3, 11>, <11, 4, 12>, and <1, 8, 12>.
