Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 22) -> 11 and 22 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 6) -> 11 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 25) -> 11 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (22, 6) -> 22 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (22, 25) -> 22 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 25) -> 6 and 25 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 28) -> 4 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are connected. Checking if they have a common 1-hop neighbor.
        * Common 1-hop neighbors of 4 and 2: 25. Triangle formed: <4, 2, 25>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (21, 3) -> 21 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (21, 1) -> 21 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are connected. Checking if they have a common 1-hop neighbor.
        * Common 1-hop neighbors of 3 and 1: None. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are connected. Checking if they have a common 1-hop neighbor.
        * Common 1-hop neighbors of 8 and 2: None. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (19, 25) -> 19 and 25 are connected. Checking if they have a common 1-hop neighbor.
        * Common 1-hop neighbors of 19 and 25: None. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (19, 29) -> 19 and 29 are connected. Checking if they have a common 1-hop neighbor.
        * Common 1-hop neighbors of 19 and 29: 25. Triangle formed: <19, 29, 25>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (12, 9) -> 12 and 9 are connected. Checking if they have a common 1-hop neighbor.
        * Common 1-hop neighbors of 12 and 9: 24. Triangle formed: <12, 9, 24>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (23, 28) -> 23 and 28 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (23, 29) -> 23 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 29) -> 28 and 29 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing the above process for the remaining nodes, and summing up the total triangles, we find:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 3

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
