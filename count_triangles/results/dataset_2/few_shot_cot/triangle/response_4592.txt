Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 10) -> 4 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>.

Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 13) -> 10 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as all nodes to form a triangle are smaller than Node 2.

Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 7, 15>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as all nodes to form a triangle are smaller than Node 5.

Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as all nodes to form a triangle are smaller than Node 6.

Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> 9 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as all nodes to form a triangle are smaller than Node 8.

Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continuing the process for the remaining nodes (9-19), we find no additional triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
