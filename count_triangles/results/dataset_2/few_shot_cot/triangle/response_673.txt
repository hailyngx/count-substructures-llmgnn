Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example using the adjacency list provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 19) -> Already connected. They are both directly connected to Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Pair 1: (0, 25) -> Already connected. They are both directly connected to Node 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 13) -> Already connected. They are both directly connected to Node 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
