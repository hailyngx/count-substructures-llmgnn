Response:
Following the same process as the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (13, 17) -> 13 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 21) -> 13 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (17, 21) -> 17 and 21 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 21) -> 9 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 24) -> 9 and 24 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 28) -> 9 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 25) -> 8 and 25 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (13, 5) -> 13 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (13, 22) -> 13 and 22 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 22) -> 5 and 22 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (10, 21) -> 10 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (19, 11) -> 19 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (26, 20) -> 26 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (26, 2) -> 26 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (26, 9) -> 26 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 26) -> 3 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (19, 21) -> 19 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (19, 2) -> 19 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (19, 10) -> 19 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (5, 28) -> 5 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Remaining nodes are not considered as they have fewer than 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
