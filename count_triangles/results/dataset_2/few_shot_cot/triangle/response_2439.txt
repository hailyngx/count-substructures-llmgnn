Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step based on each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> 4 and 14 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are also connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> 2 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Proceeding similarly for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14...

Finally, sum up the total number of triangles from all nodes.

After calculating triangles for all nodes, the output will be [3]. 

Each unique triangle found will be listed inside <> and finalized: <0, 4, 5>, <1, 9, 13>, <2, 4, 14>.
