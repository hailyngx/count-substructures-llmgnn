Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    <br>* Pair 1: (14, 25) -> 14 is connected to 0 and 25 in the adjacency list, forming a triangle.

    * Pair 2: (14, 9) -> 14 is connected to 0 in the adjacency list, but 9 is also directly connected to 3 and not to 0. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 3: (25, 9) -> 25 is connected to 0 in the adjacency list, but 9 is directly connected to 3 and not to 0. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    <br>* Pair 1: (6, 20) -> 6 is connected to 1 and 20 in the adjacency list, forming a triangle.

    * Pair 2: (6, 16) -> 6 is connected to 1 in the adjacency list, but 16 is directly connected to 15 and not to 1. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 3: (20, 16) -> 20 is connected to 1 in the adjacency list, but 16 is directly connected to 15 and not to 1. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    <br>* Pair 1: (12, 15) -> 12 and 15 are connected to 2, and they are also directly connected to each other. Triangle formed.

    * Pair 2: (12, 14) -> 12 is connected to 2 and 14 in the adjacency list, forming a triangle.

    * Pair 3: (12, 25) -> 12 is connected to 2 in the adjacency list, but 25 is directly connected to 0 and not to 2. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    <br>* Pair 1: (22, 9) -> 22 is connected to 3 in the adjacency list, but 9 is directly connected to 0 and not to 3. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    <br>* Pair 1: (22, 5) -> 22 is connected to 4 in the adjacency list, but 5 is directly connected to 13 and not to 4. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 2: (22, 11) -> 22 is connected to 4 in the adjacency list, but 11 is directly connected to 6 and not to 4. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    <br>Since these nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles, we skip them.

* Node 9:
    <br>* Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 is connected to 9, but 3 is also directly connected to 22 and not to 9. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    <br>No triangle can be formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 11:
    <br>No triangle can be formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 12:
    <br>* Pair 1: (26, 22) -> 26 is connected to 12, and 22 is connected to 12 in the adjacency list. They form a triangle.

    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    <br>No triangle can be formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 14:
    <br>* Pair 1: (2, 28) -> 2 is connected to 14, but 28 is not directly connected to 14. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are connected to 14, and they are also connected to each other. Triangle formed.

    * Pair 3: (2, 11) -> 2 is connected to 14, but 11 is directly connected to 4 and not to 14. No triangle formed.

    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    <br>Since these nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles, we skip them.

* Node 20:
    <br>No triangle can be formed with Node 20 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 21:
    <br>No triangle can be formed with Node 21 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 22:
    <br>No triangle can be formed with Node 22 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 23:
    <br>No triangle can be formed with Node 23 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 24:
    <br>No triangle can be formed with Node 24 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29:
    <br>Since all remaining nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles, we skip them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 14) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
