Response:
Following the step-by-step procedure outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (14, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (14, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (14, 5) -> 14 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (14, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (10, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (10, 5) -> 10, and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 5: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pairs skipped as they contain nodes smaller than Node 2.

    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 3:
    * Pairs skipped as they contain nodes smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, 5, 6, and 7:
    * Similar pairs analysis as above, calculating for each node, find the total triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Pairs mostly skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (11, 12) -> No triangle formed.

    * Pair 1: (14, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (14, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Pairs mostly skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (0, 12) -> 0 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 10, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.

* Node 13:
    * Pairs mostly skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pairs mostly skipped due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 6 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 6 (Node 5) + 4 (Node 6) + 6 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 28

Therefore, there are 28 triangles in the given graph.
