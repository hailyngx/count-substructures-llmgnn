Response:
Following the process described in the example provided, let's compute the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 17) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (9, 17) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (8, 17) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (12, 17) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (11, 12) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (12, 19) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 17) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (13, 17) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it is not connected to any other nodes.

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it is only connected to one node.

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.

        * Pair 3: (18, 19) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (0, 16) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (11, 16) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 10:
        * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 11:
        * Pair 1: (2, 19) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 12:
        * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 13:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 13 as it is not connected to at least two other nodes greater than itself.

    * Node 14:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 14 as it is not connected to at least two other nodes greater than itself.

    * Node 15:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 15 as it is not connected to at least two other nodes greater than itself.

    * Node 16:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 16 as it is not connected to at least two other nodes greater than itself.

    * Node 17:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 17 as it is not connected to at least two other nodes greater than itself.

    * Node 18:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 18 as it is not connected to at least two other nodes greater than itself.

    * Node 19:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 19 as it is not connected to at least two other nodes greater than itself.

Summing up the total number of triangles: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph. 

The final answer is [0].
