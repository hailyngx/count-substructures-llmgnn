Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are not connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (17, 5) -> 17 and 5 are connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (13, 0) -> 13 and 0 are connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (19, 0) -> 19 and 0 are not connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (15, 7) -> 15 and 7 are connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (15, 2) -> 15 and 2 are not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are not connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    - Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (17, 18) -> 17 and 18 are not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (17, 19) -> 17 and 19 are not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are not connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (15, 0) -> 15 and 0 are connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (14, 16) -> 14 and 16 are not connected in the edge list.
    - No more pairs can be considered for Node 9 as they are larger than node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the count of triangles for each node:
1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 7, 15>
<1, 5, 18>
<2, 13, 19>
<3, 7, 15>
<4, 11, 16>
