Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the outlined example, we will identify the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:   
    * Not considered due to smaller node numbers in the graph.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
