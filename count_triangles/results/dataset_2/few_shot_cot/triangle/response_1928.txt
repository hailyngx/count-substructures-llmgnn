Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - The only pair we could consider is (9, 6), but since 9 and 6 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected as there is no edge (1, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
