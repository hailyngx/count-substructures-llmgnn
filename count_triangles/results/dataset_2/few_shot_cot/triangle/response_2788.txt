Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only one neighbor.

- Node 1:
    - <5, 17, 1> forms a triangle.
    - No more triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
    - <7, 2, 16> forms a triangle.
    - No more triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only two neighbors.

- Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only two neighbors.

- Node 5:
    - <9, 5, 1> forms a triangle.
    - <9, 5, 16> forms a triangle.
    - No more triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only two neighbors.

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only two neighbors.

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only three neighbors.

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only two neighbors.

- Node 10:
    - <17, 10, 7> forms a triangle.
    - No more triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 11:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only two neighbors.

- Node 12:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only two neighbors.

- Node 13:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only two neighbors.

- Node 14:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only two neighbors.

- Node 15:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only three neighbors.

- Node 16:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only two neighbors.

- Node 17:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only three neighbors.

- Node 18:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only one neighbor.

- Node 19:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only three neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 10) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
