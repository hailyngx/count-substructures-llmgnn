Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (14, 29) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (14, 25) -> Triangle formed with Node 11.
    * Pair 3: (14, 26) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (29, 25) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (29, 26) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (25, 26) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (21, 29) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (21, 20) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 3: (21, 2) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 4: (21, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 5: (29, 20) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 6: (29, 2) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 7: (29, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 8: (20, 2) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 9: (20, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Pair 10: (2, 4) -> Not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for all nodes:
