Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> Node 2, and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 4) -> Node 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 6) -> Node 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 4>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Node 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Node 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 8>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Node 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 4, 9>)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Node 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<4, 8, 9>)

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 5.
    * No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
