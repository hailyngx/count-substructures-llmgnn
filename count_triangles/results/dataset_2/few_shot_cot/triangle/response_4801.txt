Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the first example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0: No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 21) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <1, 4, 21>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <2, 4, 18>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <3, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4: No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5: No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (11, 21) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <6, 11, 21>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <7, 11, 29>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8: No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9: No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 10:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 10: <10, 12, 24>
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 11: No triangles can be formed with Node 11.

* Node 12: No triangles can be formed with Node 12.

* Node 13: No triangles can be formed with Node 13.

* Node 14: No triangles can be formed with Node 14.

* Node 15: No triangles can be formed with Node 15.

* Node 16: No triangles can be formed with Node 16.

* Node 17: No triangles can be formed with Node 17.

* Node 18: No triangles can be formed with Node 18.

* Node 19: No triangles can be formed with Node 19.

* Node 20: No triangles can be formed with Node 20.

* Node 21: No additional triangles can be formed with Node 21.

* Node 22: No triangles can be formed with Node 22.

* Node 23: No triangles can be formed with Node 23.

* Node 24: No triangles can be formed with Node 24.

* Node 25: No triangles can be formed with Node 25.

* Node 26: No triangles can be formed with Node 26.

* Node 27: No triangles can be formed with Node 27.

* Node 28: No triangles can be formed with Node 28.

* Node 29: No triangles can be formed with Node 29.

Summarizing the triangles found:
[<1, 4, 21>, <2, 4, 18>, <3, 5, 7>, <6, 11, 21>, <7, 11, 29>, <10, 12, 24>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
