Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, here are the calculations for the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) - No triangle formed since 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) - No triangle formed since 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 1) - No triangle formed since 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) - No triangle formed since 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (0, 2) - Triangle formed with (0, 2) edge and node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - Triangle formed with (1, 7) edge and node 7.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - No triangle formed since 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) - No triangle formed since 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) - Triangle formed with (1, 8) edge and node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) - Triangle formed with (2, 9) edge and node 9.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) - No triangle formed since 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) - No triangle formed since 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 0) - Triangle formed with (2, 0) edge and node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Triangle formed with (3, 9) edge and node 9.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) - Triangle formed with (3, 4) edge and node 4.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) - No triangle formed since 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) - Triangle formed with (3, 8) edge and node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Triangle formed with (4, 7) edge and node 7.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Triangle formed with (4, 8) edge and node 8.
    * Pair 3: (4, 2) - No triangle formed since 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 3) - Triangle formed with (4, 3) edge and node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed since 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) - No triangle formed since 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) - Triangle formed with (6, 7) edge and node 7.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) - No triangle formed since 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Now considering nodes greater than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Triangle formed with (7, 8) edge and node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Triangle formed with (8, 9) edge and node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) - Triangle formed with (9, 8) edge and node 8.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) - Triangle formed with (9, 2) edge and node 2.
    * Pair 3: (9, 3) - Triangle formed with (9, 3) edge and node 3.
    * Pair 4: (9, 0) - No triangle formed since 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 17.

Therefore, there are [17 triangles] in the given graph.
