Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 14) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (1, 10) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (1, 14) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (3, 14) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (10, 14) -> No triangle formed as 10 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as all potential pairs include nodes smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as all potential pairs include nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 6: (2, 13) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 13>.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (13, 9) -> No triangle formed as 13 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as all potential pairs include nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as all potential pairs include nodes smaller than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 12 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 to 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8 to 14) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
