Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are not connected because (1, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are not connected because (12, 13) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 3) -> 10 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 10 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 10 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 10 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 10 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 10 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (12, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 11 and 14 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> 7 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 12 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 5 to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 6 to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 7 to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 8 to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.

* Node 10:
    * Skip as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 10 to form triangles.

* Node 11:
    * Skip as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 11 to form triangles.

* Node 12:
    * Skip as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 12 to form triangles.

* Node 13:
    * Skip as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 13 to form triangles.

* Node 14:
    * Skip as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 14 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
