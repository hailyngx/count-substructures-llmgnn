Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 22) -> 3 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 22) -> 6 and 22 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (13, 28) -> 13 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (22, 27) -> 22 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (22, 24) -> 22 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 20) -> 4 and 20 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 16) -> 4 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (10, 16) -> 10 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than the respective node to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
