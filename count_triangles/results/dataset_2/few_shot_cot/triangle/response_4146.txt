Response:
Let's start finding the triangles in the graph by examining each node:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Nodes 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected in the graph. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 13) -> Nodes 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
[<0, 2, 3>, <0, 4, 12>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 4, 13>, <5, 7, 11>]
