Response:
Following the step-by-step process as described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:**
    * Pair 1: (3, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 11) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
    * Pair 1: (7, 14) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (12, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
    * All pairs with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node are smaller than Node 5. No triangles formed with Node 5.

7. **Node 6:**
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 6 to form triangles.

8. **Node 7:**
    * Skipped as all pairs are smaller nodes than 7.

9. **Node 8:**
    * All pairs with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node are smaller nodes. No triangles formed with Node 8.

10. **Node 9:**
    * All pairs with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node are smaller nodes. No triangles formed with Node 9.

11. **Node 10:**
    * All pairs with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node are smaller nodes. No triangles formed with Node 10.

12. **Node 11:**
    * All pairs with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node are smaller nodes. No triangles formed with Node 11.

13. **Node 12:**
    * All pairs with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node are smaller nodes. No triangles formed with Node 12.

14. **Node 13:**
    * All pairs with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node are smaller nodes. No triangles formed with Node 13.

15. **Node 14:**
    * All pairs with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node are smaller nodes. No triangles formed with Node 14.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the given graph:
Total triangles = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14)
Total triangles = 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
