Response:
Following the step-by-step approach provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Connected as (2, 7) in the edge list. Checking for common neighbor:
        * Common neighbor of 2 and 7: 0
        * Triangle formed: <0, 2, 7>
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Connected as (2, 8) in the edge list. Checking for common neighbor:
        * Common neighbor of 2 and 8: 0
        * Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Checking for common neighbor:
        * Common neighbor of 5 and 7: 1
        * Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 7>
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Connected as (3, 8) in the edge list. Checking for common neighbor:
        * Common neighbor of 3 and 8: 1
        * Triangle formed: <1, 3, 8>
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Connected as (7, 8) in the edge list. Checking for common neighbor:
        * Common neighbor of 7 and 8: 1
        * Triangle formed: <1, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Checking for common neighbor:
        * Common neighbor of 4 and 9: 3
        * Triangle formed: <1, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Connected as (0, 7) in the edge list. Checking for common neighbor:
        * Common neighbor of 0 and 7: 8
        * Triangle formed: <0, 7, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 4), but since 1 and 4 are both smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * Skipped since there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
