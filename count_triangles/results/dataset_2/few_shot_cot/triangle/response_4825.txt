Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
   - Pair 1: (10, 8) - Not directly connected, so no triangle.
   - Pair 2: (10, 12) - Not directly connected, so no triangle.
   - Pair 3: (10, 6) - Not directly connected, so no triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
   - Pair 1: (5, 10) - Not directly connected, so no triangle.
   - Pair 2: (5, 12) - Not directly connected, so no triangle.
   - Pair 3: (5, 8) - Not directly connected, so no triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
   - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
   - Pair 1: (4, 3) - Not directly connected, so no triangle.
   - Pair 2: (4, 11) - Directly connected, triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (4, 8) - Not directly connected, so no triangle.
   - Pair 4: (4, 9) - Not directly connected, so no triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
   - Pair 1: (9, 10) - Directly connected, triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (9, 2) - Not directly connected, so no triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
   - Pair 1: (7, 14) - Not directly connected, so no triangle.
   - Pair 2: (7, 6) - Directly connected, triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (7, 2) - Not directly connected, so no triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
   - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
   - Pair 1: (7, 12) - Not directly connected, so no triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
   - Skip pairs with Nodes 4 and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
   - Pair 1: (13, 10) - Not directly connected, so no triangle.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles, so they are skipped.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
