Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 10) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 10 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 13 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Considering all pairs involving Node 2:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Triangle formed with Node 3, 5, and 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 13 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is the sum of triangles obtained for each node:
Total Triangles = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 1

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [1].
