Response:
Following the step-by-step process to find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 23) -> 6 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 23) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (12, 21) -> 12 and 21 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 24) -> 12 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 26) -> 11 and 26 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (11, 26) in the edge list.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) + 0 (Node 20) + 0 (Node 21) + 0 (Node 22) + 0 (Node 23) + 0 (Node 24) + 0 (Node 25) + 0 (Node 26) + 0 (Node 27) + 0 (Node 28) + 0 (Node 29) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
