Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Triangle <0, 4, 7>
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Triangle <0, 4, 8>
    * Pair 4: (4, 0) -> Triangle <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> Triangle <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> Triangle <1, 2, 8>
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (1, 8) -> Triangle <1, 4, 8>
    * Pair 8: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> Triangle <1, 2, 8>
    * Pair 5: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> Triangle <1, 2, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
