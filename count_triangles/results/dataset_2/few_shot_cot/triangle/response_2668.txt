Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 5) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 9) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 14) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (8, 14) - No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (6, 13) - No triangle formed.
