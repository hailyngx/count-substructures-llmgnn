Response:
Following the same method as explained in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 14) -> 1 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (1, 14) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (14, 6) -> 14 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (14, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 6) -> 13 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (13, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 10) -> 13 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (13, 10) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 10) -> 6 and 10 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (6, 10) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) -> 4 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (4, 12) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (12, 2) -> 12 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (12, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (8, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
