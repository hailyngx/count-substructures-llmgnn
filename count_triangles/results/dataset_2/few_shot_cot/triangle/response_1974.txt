Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 8, 2>.
    * Pair 4: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 0 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed <1, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 0 are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 3 are also connected. Triangle formed <2, 4, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed <2, 8, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed <6, 9, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
