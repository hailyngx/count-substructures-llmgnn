Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 11) -> 7 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 3 as they are smaller than 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 12, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 12 as it is smaller than 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 18 as it is smaller than 16.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:
    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 and 12 as they are smaller than 18.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 5 as they are smaller than 19.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 1 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) 

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
