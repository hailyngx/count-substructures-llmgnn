Response:
Following the method described in the example provided and based on the given graph, we will count the triangles for each node. Here we go:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (9, 10) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 12) -> 3 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (3, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 17) -> 2 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 12) -> 1 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (1, 12) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 16) -> 3 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (3, 16) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (14, 15) -> 14 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (14, 15) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * ...Similar steps carried out for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * ...Similar steps carried out for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * ...Similar steps carried out for Node 7.
