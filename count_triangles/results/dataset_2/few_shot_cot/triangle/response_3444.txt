Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 0 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles to form as there aren't any nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles to form as there aren't any nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
