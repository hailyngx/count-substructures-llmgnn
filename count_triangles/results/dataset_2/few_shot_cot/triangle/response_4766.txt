Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 9 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (6, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (6, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (6, 0) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 9 and 0 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4 because (6, 0) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4 because (6, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 0 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 9 because (1, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
