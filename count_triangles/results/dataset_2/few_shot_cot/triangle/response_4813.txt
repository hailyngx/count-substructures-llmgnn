Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (11, 16) -> 11 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 19) -> 11 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 15 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 16:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 16 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 17:

    * Total triangles with Node 17 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 18:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <5, 19, 1>, <5, 13, 3>, and <14, 16, 8>.
The final answer is [3].
