Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's count the triangles formed by each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Connected through Node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 12) -> Connected through Node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 12) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 14) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> Connected through Node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 17) -> Connected through Node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 17) -> Connected through Node 17. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 19) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 19) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 12) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 14) -> Connected through Node 14. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 17) -> Connected through Node 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 17) -> Connected through Node 17. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (10, 19) -> Connected through Node 10. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (17, 19) -> Connected through Node 17. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (16, 18) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (13, 15) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than any of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
