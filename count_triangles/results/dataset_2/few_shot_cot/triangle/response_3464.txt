Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph by following the same step-by-step process as in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (11, 15) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (11, 3) -> 11 and 3 are not connected because there is no edge (11, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 3) -> 15 and 3 are not connected because there is no edge (15, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) -> 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (10, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (10, 19) -> 10 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge (10, 19) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (10, 12) -> 10 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (10, 12) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) -> 5 and 18 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 because there is no edge (5, 18) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Continuing this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 do not form any triangles as the possible pairs are either not connected or not 1-hop neighbors.
  
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 * 14 = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
