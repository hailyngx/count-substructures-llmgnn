Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node one by one:

1. Node 0:
   - Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
   - No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

2. Node 1:
   - Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
   - No triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. Node 2:
   - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected (3, 4).
   - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
   - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected (4, 8).
   - No more pairs possible for Node 2.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 4, 8>).

4. Node 3:
   - Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
   - No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. Node 4:
   - Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
   - No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. Node 5:
   - Pair 1: (1, 11) -> 1 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected (1, 11).
   - No more pairs possible for Node 5.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 11, 5>).

7. Node 6:
   - Skipped all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
   - No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
   - No pairs possible as there are no nodes greater than 7.
   - No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8:
   - No pairs possible as there are no nodes greater than 8.
   - No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
   - Pair 1: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected (10, 11).
   - No more pairs possible for Node 9.
   - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<10, 11, 9>).

11. Node 10:
   - No pairs possible as there are no nodes greater than 10.
   - No triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. Node 11:
   - No pairs possible as there are no nodes greater than 11.
   - No triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. Node 12:
   - No pairs possible as there are no nodes greater than 12.
   - No triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

14. Node 13:
   - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 13, and they are connected (3, 4).
   - No triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. Node 14:
   - No pairs possible as there are no nodes greater than 14.
   - No triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are: <3, 4, 8>, <1, 11, 5>, and <10, 11, 9>.

So, the final answer is [3].
