Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the sample with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) -> 3 and 14 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 13) -> 5 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 14) -> 6 and 14 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more valid triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as all other nodes are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * No more valid triangles can be formed using these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 6

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
