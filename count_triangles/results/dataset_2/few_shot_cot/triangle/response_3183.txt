Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    * Pair 1: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (19, 3) -> 19 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (19, 8) -> 19 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1**:
    * The only pair we could consider is (11, 29), but since 11 and 29 are both smaller nodes, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2**:
    * Node 2 does not form a triangle with any other nodes as it is connected to only one node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3**:
    * Pair 1: (26, 7) -> 26 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (26, 24) -> 26 and 24 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (26, 10) -> 26 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 24) -> 7 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (24, 10) -> 24 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Continue this process for the remaining nodes: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

6. Once you have counted all triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node, sum up the total triangles from each node.

7. Finally, calculate the total number of triangles in the graph by adding all the triangles found in step 6.

Following this process, please find the total number of triangles in the graph and list the unique triangles found inside brackets [].
