Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by following the step-by-step process for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (25, 28) -> Both 25 and 28 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (25, 10) -> Both 25 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (28, 10) -> Both 28 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (18, 10) -> Both 18 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (18, 24) -> Both 18 and 24 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (18, 8) -> Both 18 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (18, 23) -> Both 18 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Both 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 18) -> Both 9 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 18) -> Both 3 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

We will continue this process for Nodes 3 to 29 and then sum up the total triangles found.

Please find the final answer inside brackets [] after counting all the triangles.
