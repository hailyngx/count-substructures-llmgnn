Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip, as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 18) -> 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip, as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 15) -> 4 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 15 are connected as (4, 15) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 15) -> 7 and 15 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 15 are connected as (7, 15) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 13) -> 9 and 13 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 13 are connected as (9, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 16) -> 7 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 16 are connected as (7, 16) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (12, 16) -> 12 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip, as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (12, 14) -> 12 and 14 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 12 and 14 are connected as (12, 14) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip, as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 10.

Let's continue this process for Nodes 11 to 19.
