Response:
Following the same step-by-step process illustrated in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 12) -> 8 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 12 are also connected as (8, 12).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (23, 6) -> 23 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 23 and 6 are also connected as (23, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (16, 14) -> 16 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 27) -> 7 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 27 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (23, 16) -> 23 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 23 and 16 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 29) -> 9 and 29 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 29 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (20, 26) -> 20 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 20 and 26 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 27) -> 3 and 27 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 27 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (21, 23) -> 21 and 23 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (24, 13) -> 24 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 24 and 13 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10 to Node 29:
    * Similar pairs as calculated above with larger numbered nodes are skipped due to not having 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<7, 3, 27>
<9, 24, 13>
<5, 9, 29>
<0, 8, 12>
<23, 4, 16>
<1, 6, 23>
<20, 26, 6>
