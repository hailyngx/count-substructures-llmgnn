Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, I will count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14
    * Pair 3: (7, 1) -> Does not form a triangle
    * Pair 4: (12, 5) -> Does not form a triangle
    * Pair 5: (12, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9
    * Pair 6: (5, 1) -> Does not form a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12
    * Pair 2: (9, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 11
    * Pair 3: (9, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0
    * Pair 4: (4, 12) -> Forms a triangle with Node 14
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9
    * Pair 2: (6, 2) -> Does not form a triangle
    * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> Does not form a triangle
    * Pair 4: (6, 10) -> Does not form a triangle
    * Pair 5: (8, 10) -> Does not form a triangle
    * Pair 6: (8, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (11, 5) -> Does not form a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> Forms a triangle with Node 12
    * Pair 2: (6, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5
    * Pair 3: (6, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7
    * Pair 4: (6, 1) -> Does not form a triangle
    * Pair 5: (11, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 13
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other pairs to consider, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7
    * Pair 2: (8, 10) -> Does not form a triangle
    * Pair 3: (2, 10) -> Does not form a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 10) -> Does not form a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (14, 13) -> Does not form a triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph. 

Thus, the answer is [15].
