Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <4, 5, 8>. 

So, the final answer is [12].
