Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 17) -> 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 19) -> 5 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 11) -> 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 13) -> 6 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 11) -> 10 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * There are no triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * There are no triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> 8 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 19) -> 8 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 13) -> 1 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 13) -> 3 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 16) -> 6 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8-19) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
