Response:
Following the method explained in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. **Node 0:**
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Connected by (3, 7)
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Not directly connected
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Connected by (7, 9)
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Connected by (2, 4)
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Not directly connected
    * Pair 3: (2, 14) -> Not directly connected
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Not directly connected
    * Pair 5: (4, 14) -> Not directly connected
    * Pair 6: (6, 14) -> Not directly connected
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes
    * No additional triangles could be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
    * Pair 1: (4, 11) -> Connected by (4, 11)
    * Pair 2: (4, 14) -> Not directly connected
    * Pair 3: (11, 14) -> Not directly connected
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4:**
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes
    * No additional triangles could be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
    * No triangles can be formed with higher-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
    * No triangles can be formed with higher-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) -> Connected by (9, 14)
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. **Node 8:**
    * Not part of any triangle
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    * No additional triangles could be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

11. **Node 10:**
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes
    * No additional triangles could be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

12. **Node 11:**
    * No triangles can be formed with higher-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

13. **Node 12:**
    * No triangles can be formed with higher-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

14. **Node 13:**
    * No triangles can be formed with higher-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

15. **Node 14:**
    * No triangles can be formed with higher-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Therefore, based on the calculations for each node, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <3, 4, 11>, <7, 9, 14>, and <0, 3, 7>.
