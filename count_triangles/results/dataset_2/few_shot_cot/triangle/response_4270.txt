Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 8 are not connected as there is no edge (9, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 0 are not connected as there is no edge (9, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 2 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7, 8, 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

        Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
