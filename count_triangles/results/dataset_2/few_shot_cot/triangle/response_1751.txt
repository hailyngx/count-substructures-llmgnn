Response:
Following the step-by-step process as described in the example above to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 16 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 16) -> 8 and 16 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 16 are connected as (8, 0, 16) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (13, 16) -> 13 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (13, 16) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (13, 12) -> 13 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (8, 2, 13) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (21, 26) -> 21 and 26 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 17) -> 7 and 17 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (7, 17) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 28) -> 4 and 28 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (4, 28) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (9, 5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 10) -> 5 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (14, 23) -> 14 and 23 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 17) -> 4 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (4, 7, 17) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (21, 7) -> 21 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (21, 7, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (25, 17) -> 25 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this step-by-step process for Nodes 9 to 29, and then summing up the total number of triangles formed:
