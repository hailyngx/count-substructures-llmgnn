Response:
Following the same process detailed in the example, let's count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 11) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 10) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least two nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
