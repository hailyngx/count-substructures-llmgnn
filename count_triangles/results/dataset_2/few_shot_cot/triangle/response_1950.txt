Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph by examining each node's connections:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) -> Both 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as (0, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as (0, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 2) -> Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as (0, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected as (1, 6) in the edge list.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.

    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
