Response:
Let's count the triangles in this graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> No triangle formed (1 and 6 are not connected).
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed <6, 8, 0>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 13) -> No triangle formed (6 and 13 are not connected).
    * Pair 4: (6, 4) -> Triangle formed <6, 4, 0>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> Triangle formed <1, 11, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed (3 and 8 are not connected).
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed (3 and 7 are not connected).
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed (3 and 5 are not connected).
    * Pair 4: (3, 10) -> No triangle formed (3 and 10 are not connected).

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <6, 8, 0>, <1, 11, 4>, <7, 4, 3>, <7, 0, 4>, <1, 11, 4>, <7, 0, 13>. Hence, the final answer is [6].
