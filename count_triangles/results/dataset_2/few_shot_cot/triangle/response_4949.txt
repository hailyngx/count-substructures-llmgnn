Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected (4, 6) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Let's continue for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 5:
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
