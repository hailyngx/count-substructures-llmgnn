    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 13) -> 8 and 13 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 14) -> 8 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (13, 14) -> 13 and 14 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 11) -> 8 and 11 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 10) -> 1 and 10 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 10) -> 3 and 10 are connected.

    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> 0 and 13 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
