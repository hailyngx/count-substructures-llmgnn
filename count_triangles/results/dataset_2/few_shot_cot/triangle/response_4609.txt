Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, we can calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected. No other node to form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 9. Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 9. Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
