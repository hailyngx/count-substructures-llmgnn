Response:
Following the same method as described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 10) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 10>

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 15) -> Triangle formed: <1, 6, 15>

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 17) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 17>

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 18) -> Triangle formed: <3, 8, 18>

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed: <4, 7, 9>
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <4, 7, 10>
    - Pair 3: (0, 16) -> Triangle formed: <4, 0, 16>

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (5, 14) -> Triangle formed: <5, 14, 10>
    - Pair 2: (5, 15) -> Triangle formed: <5, 15, 14>

    - Pair 2: (7, 10) -> Triangle formed: <7, 10, 4>
    - Pair 3: (5, 14) -> Triangle formed: <7, 5, 14>

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (3, 18) -> Triangle formed: <8, 3, 18>
    - Pair 2: (8, 10) -> Triangle formed: <8, 10, 14>

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (7, 18) -> Triangle formed: <9, 7, 18>

* Node 10:
    - Pair 1: (14, 5) -> Triangle formed: <10, 14, 5>
    - Pair 2: (10, 14) -> Triangle formed: <10, 14, 5>

* Node 11:
    - Pair 1: (11, 9) -> Triangle formed: <11, 9, 4>
    - Pair 2: (15, 1) -> Triangle formed: <11, 15, 1>

    - Pair 1: (12, 17) -> Triangle formed: <13, 12, 17>

* Node 14:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <14, 5, 7>

* Node 15:
    - Pair 1: (15, 19) -> Triangle formed: <15, 19, 6>

* Node 16:
    - Pair 1: (0, 17) -> Triangle formed: <16, 0, 17>

* Node 17:
    - Pair 1: (16, 2) -> Triangle formed: <17, 16, 2>
    - Pair 2: (17, 19) -> Triangle formed: <17, 19, 2>

* Node 19:
    - Pair 1: (18, 17) -> Triangle formed: <19, 18, 3>

Therefore, there are the following unique triangles found: <0, 4, 10>, <1, 6, 15>, <2, 3, 17>, <3, 8, 18>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 10>, <4, 0, 16>, <5, 14, 10>, <5, 15, 14>, <6, 6, 15>, <6, 19, 15>, <7, 4, 9>, <7, 10, 4>, <7, 5, 14>, <8, 3, 18>, <8, 10, 14>, <9, 7, 18>, <10, 14, 5>, <11, 9, 4>, <11, 15, 1>, <12, 13, 17>, <12, 14, 10>, <13, 12, 17>, <14, 5, 7>, <15, 19, 6>, <16, 0, 17>, <17, 16, 2>, <17, 19, 2>, <18, 19, 6>, <19, 18, 3>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [30].
