Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (5, 11) -> 5 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (14, 3) -> 14 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (14, 11) -> 14 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (3, 11) -> 3 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (5, 14) -> 5 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (14, 2) -> 14 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (14, 12) -> 14 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (2, 12) -> 2 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * ...

Continue this process for each node in the graph, then sum up the total number of triangles. 

Your final answer should be inside brackets [].
