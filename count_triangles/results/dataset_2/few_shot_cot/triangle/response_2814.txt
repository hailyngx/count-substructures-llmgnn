Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7

Response:
Following the same process as the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 0) and (0, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are connected as (6, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are connected as (8, 0) and (0, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are connected as (8, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 1) and (1, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 1) and (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are connected as (5, 1) and (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pairs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 all have smaller numbered nodes, so no triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are connected as (5, 1) and (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are connected as (6, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are connected as (8, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are connected as (8, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pairs 1 and 2 have smaller numbered nodes, so no triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pairs 1 and 2 have smaller numbered nodes, so no triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
