Response:
Following the instructions from the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 4) - Both 11 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) - Both 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 14) - Both 3 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 18) - Both 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) - Both 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 18) - Both 6 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (14, 1) - Both 14 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 15) - Both 12 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (15, 8) - Both 15 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 12) - Both 15 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (13, 8), but since 13 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, and Node 19:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

After calculating the triangles with each node as the smallest numbered node, we count the total number of triangles:
* Total triangles = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
