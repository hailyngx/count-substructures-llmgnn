Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 13) -> The edge (2, 13) is part of the graph. Now we need to see if 2 and 13 have a common neighbor.
        * Common neighbor: Node 4. Triangle <0, 2, 4> formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 13) -> The edge (9, 13) is a part of the graph. Now we need to see if 9 and 13 have a common neighbor.
        * No common neighbor found to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<0, 2, 4>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> The edge (5, 7) is part of the graph. Now we need to see if 5 and 7 have a common neighbor.
        * Common neighbor: Node 18. Triangle <1, 5, 18> formed.
    * No other pairs to check for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 5, 18>)

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (11, 14) -> Both 11 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to check for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 13) -> The edge (4, 13) is part of the graph. Now we need to see if 4 and 13 have a common neighbor.
        * Common neighbor: Node 5. Triangle <3, 4, 5> formed.
    * No other pairs to check for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 4, 5>)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 17) -> Both 6 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to check for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (14, 18) -> Both 14 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle <5, 14, 18> formed.
    * No other pairs to check for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<5, 14, 18>)

Continuing this process for Nodes 6 to 19:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> The edge (3, 4) is a part of the graph. Now we need to see if 3 and 4 have a common neighbor.
        * Common neighbor: Node 13. Triangle <6, 3, 13> formed.
    * No other pairs to check for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<6, 3, 13>)

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 19) -> The edge (9, 19) is part of the graph. Now we need to see if 9 and 19 have a common neighbor.
        * No common neighbor found to form a triangle.
    * No other pairs to check for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 to 19:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
