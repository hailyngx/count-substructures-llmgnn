Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 27) -> 1 and 27 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (27, 19) -> 27 and 19 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 20) -> 2 and 20 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (20, 5) -> 20 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Continuing this process for Nodes 6 to 29, we find the following:
    * Node 6: 0 triangles
    * Node 7: 1 triangle
    * Node 8: 0 triangles
    * Node 9: 0 triangles
    * Node 10: 0 triangles
    * Node 11: 0 triangles
    * Node 12: 0 triangles
    * Node 13: 0 triangles
    * Node 14: 0 triangles
    * Node 15: 0 triangles
    * Node 16: 0 triangles
    * Node 17: 0 triangles
    * Node 18: 0 triangles
    * Node 19: 1 triangle
    * Node 20: 0 triangles
    * Node 21: 0 triangles
    * Node 22: 0 triangles
    * Node 23: 0 triangles
    * Node 24: 1 triangle
    * Node 25: 0 triangles
    * Node 26: 0 triangles
    * Node 27: 0 triangles
    * Node 28: 0 triangles
    * Node 29: 0 triangles

* Total triangles in the graph: 3
* Unique triangles: <0, 1, 19>, <1, 7, 26>, <1, 5, 24>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
