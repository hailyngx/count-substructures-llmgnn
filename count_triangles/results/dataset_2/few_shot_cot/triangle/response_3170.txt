Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (5, 12) -> 5 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (9, 11) -> 9 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (9, 10) -> 9 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
  - Pairs: (No triangles involving nodes smaller than 2)

- Node 3:
  - Pairs: (No triangles involving nodes smaller than 3)

- Node 4:
  - Pairs: (No triangles involving nodes smaller than 4)

- Node 5:
  - Pairs: (No triangles involving nodes smaller than 5)

- Node 6:
  - Pairs: (No triangles involving nodes smaller than 6)

- Node 7:
  - Pairs: (No triangles involving nodes smaller than 7)

- Node 8:
  - Pairs: (No triangles involving nodes smaller than 8)

- Node 9:
  - Pairs: (No triangles involving nodes smaller than 9)

- Node 10:
  - Pairs: (No triangles involving nodes smaller than 10)

- Node 11:
  - Pairs: (No triangles involving nodes smaller than 11)

- Node 12:
  - Pairs: (No triangles involving nodes smaller than 12)

- Node 13:
  - Pairs: (No triangles involving nodes smaller than 13)

- Node 14:
  - Pairs: (No triangles involving nodes smaller than 14)

Summarizing the triangles found:
- Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
