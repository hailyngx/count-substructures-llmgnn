Response:
Following the same process as outlined in the example: 

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5. 
        * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (9, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * The only pair we could consider is (1, 8), but since 1 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
        * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (8, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the answer is [7].
