Response:
Following the process described in the example, we will determine the number of triangles in the given graph using the adjacency list provided for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (15, 7) - Both 15 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (15, 18) - Both 15 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (15, 6) - Both 15 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 18) - Both 7 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) - Both 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 18) - Both 7 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 18) - Both 2 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 18) - Both 5 and 18 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) - Both 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 17) - Both 5 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 17) - Both 1 and 17 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are processed similarly based on their 1-hop neighbor sets.

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles: 2

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles: 1

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles: 1

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles: 1

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 do not form triangles with other nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
