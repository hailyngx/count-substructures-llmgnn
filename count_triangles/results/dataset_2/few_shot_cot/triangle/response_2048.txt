Response:
Following the given example, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 14) -> Forms a triangle with edge (2, 0), (0, 14).
    * Pair 2: (2, 15) -> Does not form a triangle as nodes 2 and 15 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 11) -> Does not form a triangle as nodes 2 and 11 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 12) -> Does not form a triangle as nodes 2 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (14, 15) -> Does not form a triangle as nodes 14 and 15 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (14, 11) -> Does not form a triangle as nodes 14 and 11 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (14, 12) -> Does not form a triangle as nodes 14 and 12 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (15, 11) -> Does not form a triangle as nodes 15 and 11 are not connected.

    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 0 (Node 15) + 0 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
