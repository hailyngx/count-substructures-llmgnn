    - Skip, only 5 neighbors

3. Node 2:
    - Skip, only 4 neighbors

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 11) -> 4 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 11 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (5, 11) -> No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 11) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
