Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 16) -> 2 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 15) -> 2 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 16) -> 5 and 16 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 19) -> 7 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> 13 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 11) -> 0 and 11 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with all nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 15) -> 9 and 15 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 19) -> 1 and 19 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Next, we will continue the process for nodes 10 to 19 to find all triangles in the graph.
