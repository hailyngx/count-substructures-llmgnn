Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as before:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <0, 2, 4>
        * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 7>
        * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 4, 9>
        * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 4, 6>
        * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8: <6, 7, 8>
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <0, 2, 5>
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <4, 6, 8>
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip all pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip all pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, and <4, 6, 8>.
