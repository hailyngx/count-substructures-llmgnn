Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0 is smaller).
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0 and 1 are smaller).
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, and 2 are smaller).
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, and 3 are smaller).
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are smaller).
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 7), but since they are both nodes 6, no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are smaller).
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9:
    * Skipped because no other nodes are greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

[<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>]
