Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9: <0, 1, 4>
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 18: <0, 9, 18>
    * Pair 3: (1, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 because it's smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (13, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <2, 13, 19>
    * Pair 2: (13, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (13, 19) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3, 4, 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (2, 3) that have already been checked.
    * No triangles found with Nodes 3, 4, or 5 as the smallest numbered nodes.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (12, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (12, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes that have already been checked.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (10, 12) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (10, 18) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes that have already been checked.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 10:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes that have already been checked.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (e.g., 11, 12) that have already been checked.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes that have already been checked.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * Pair 1: (10, 17) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 15, 16, 17:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes that have already been checked.
    * No triangles found with Nodes 15, 16, or 17 as the smallest numbered nodes.

* Node 18:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes that have already been checked.
    * Total triangles with Node 18 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 19:
    * Pair 1: (10, 19) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9: <9, 10, 19>
    * Total triangles with Node 19 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 19) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 9, 18>, <2, 13, 19>, <9, 10, 19>]
