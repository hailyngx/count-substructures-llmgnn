Response:
Following the approach described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph given.

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (2, 13) 
    - Pair 2: (2, 11) 
    - Pair 3: (13, 11) 
    - No triangles formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) 
    - Pair 2: (6, 2) 
    - Pair 3: (9, 2) 
    - No triangles formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. **Node 2:**
    - Pair 1: (8, 13) 
    - Pair 2: (8, 11) 
    - Pair 3: (13, 11) 
    - No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) 
    - Pair 2: (4, 10) 
    - Pair 3: (7, 10) 
    - No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. **Node 4:**
    - Pair 1: (9, 7) 
    - Pair 2: (9, 11) 
    - Pair 3: (7, 11) 
    - No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. **Node 5:**
    - Pair 1: (7, 10) 
    - No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6:**
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) 
    - Pair 2: (1, 14) 
    - Pair 3: (9, 14) 
    - No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. **Node 7:**
    - Pair 1: (4, 10) 
    - No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. **Node 8:**
    - Pair 1: (13, 7) 
    - No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. **Node 9:**
    - Pair 1: (6, 1) 
    - Pair 2: (6, 14) 
    - Pair 3: (1, 14) 
    - No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

11. **Node 10:**
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) 
    - No triangles formed with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node.

12. **Node 11:**
    - Pair 1: (0, 12) 
    - No triangles formed with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node.

13. **Node 12:**
    - No triangles formed with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node.

14. **Node 13:**
    - No triangles formed with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node.

15. **Node 14:**
    - No triangles formed with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
