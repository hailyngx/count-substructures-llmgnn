Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 10) -> 7 and 10 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 18) -> 7 and 18 are connected through node 0. No other nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected through node 1. No other nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Pair 2: (3, 19) -> 3 and 19 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 19) -> 4 and 19 are connected through node 1. No other nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (11, 4) -> 11 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 13) -> 11 and 13 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 13) -> 4 and 13 are connected through node 2. No other nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 13) -> 7 and 13 are connected through node 3. No other nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (11, 15) -> 11 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (11, 17) -> 11 and 17 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (17, 15) -> 17 and 15 are connected through node 4. No other nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (16, 8) -> 16 and 8 are connected through node 5. No other nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 15) -> 3 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (12, 13) -> 12 and 13 are connected through node 7. No other nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (16, 9) -> 16 and 9 are connected through node 8. No other nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (10, 15) -> 10 and 15 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19:
    * Since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes, we skip calculating triangles with them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
