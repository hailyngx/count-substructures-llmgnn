Response:
Following the example provided, we will determine the number of triangles in the given graph.
We will iteratively analyze each node and its 1-hop neighbors to count the triangles.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Connected to 6 and 7, which are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider for node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider for node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Connected to 4 and 5, which are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * No pairs to consider for node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * Pair 1: (0, 13) -> Connected to 0 and 13, which are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 1 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) + 1 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) + 0 (Node 17) + 0 (Node 18) + 0 (Node 19) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
