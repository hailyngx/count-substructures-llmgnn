Response:
Following the steps provided in the example, we will now count the number of triangles in this graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 1, and 5 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (6, 10) - Both 6 and 10 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 11) - Both 6 and 11 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 12) - Both 6 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 5) - Both 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 6 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) - Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 and 14 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 11, and 4 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 12) - Both 4 and 12 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9, 8, 13, and 5 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 10 and 14 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (10, 14) - Both 10 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7: 
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9, 11, and 12 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9, 4, and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 14) - Both 9 and 14 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 14, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (14, 4) - Both 14 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 10:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 11 and 5 as they are smaller than 10.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 10.
    * Total triangles with Node 10 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 11:
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 11.
    * Total triangles with Node 11 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 12:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 12.
    * Total triangles with Node 12 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 13:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 14 and 4 as they are smaller than 13.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 13.
    * Total triangles with Node 13 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 14:
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 14.
    * Total triangles with Node 14 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) + 0 (Node 10) + 0 (Node 11) + 0 (Node 12) + 0 (Node 13) + 0 (Node 14) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is: [3].
